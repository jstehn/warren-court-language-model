TRUST & SAVINGS ASS'N(1938)\nNo. 365\nArgued: February 2, 1938Decided: February 28, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 350, 351]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William Lemke, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Hugo A. Steinmeyer, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ was asked to review a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, upholding the objections and exceptions of the respondent, a creditor, to the final account of petitioner, a conciliation commissioner appointed under section 75(a) of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended, 11 U.S.C.A.  203(a), and reversing the order of the District Court which had settled and allowed the account. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the petitioner should have been required to pay to respondent the gross proceeds of the grape crop harvested on the debtor's land after the debtor had filed his petition under section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended, 11 U.S.C.A.  203, without any deduction for moneys spent in harvesting that crop and for other purposes, because of the fact that the crop was subject to a chattel mortgage held by respondent. 90 F.2d 750. In view of the importance of the question with respect to proceedings instituted under section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act, this Court granted certiorari, \n302 \nU.S. 674\n, 58 S.Ct. 55, 82 L.Ed. --.\n On August 6, 1934, Andrea Cuccia, a farmer, filed an adequate petition under section 75(a) to (r) of the Bankruptcy Act, 47 Stat. 1470- 1473, as amended, 48 Stat. 925,  8, 9, 11 U.S.C.A.  203 and note, showing by the schedules secured claims to respondent of over $12,000 and unsecured claims of a \n\n[303 \nU.S. 350, 352]\n\u00a0\n slightly larger amount, and expressing his desire to effect a composition or extension of time to pay his debts. His petition was referred to Noah Adair, the Conciliation Commissioner for the County of San Bernardino, California. On January 7, 1935, an amended petition was filed by the debtor, stating that he had failed to obtain the approval of his creditors to a composition or extension proposal and praying that he might be adjudged a bankrupt under the provisions of section 75, subsection (s) of the Bankruptcy Act, as enacted June 28, 1934, 48 Stat. 1289, 11 U.S.C.A.  203 note. Adjudication was entered and the proceedings referred to the referee in bankruptcy. On October 14, 1935, the District Court, on a motion by the respondent, dismissed the petition. On March 16, 1936, the debtor attempted to invoke the benefits of the amended section 75(s), 11 U. S.C.A.  203(s), but we are not here concerned with that petition and the subsequent proceedings (set out in Bank of America National Trust & Savings Ass'n v. Cuccia, 93 F.2d 754, decided December 30, 1937, on rehearing, by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit).\n The respondent, at the beginning of and throughout the proceedings, held a matured note of the debtor and his wife, secured by a deed of trust on certain lands in the county of San Bernardino, California, and by a mortgage on the crops growing or to be grown on the same lands, during 1933 and 1934, or prior to the payment in full of the total indebtedness. The crop mortgage required the mortgagor to cultivate, harvest and deliver the crop to the mortgagee, without cost to the mortgagee, for sale and application of the proceeds to the debt.\n The present controversy had its origin in the respondent's petition to the Court, on February 6, 1936, for an accounting by the conciliation commissioner of funds realized from crops sold off the debtor's premises in 1934. In response to the order of the District Court, the conciliation commissioner made an accounting as appears in \n\n[303 \nU.S. 350, 353]\n\u00a0\n the footnote. \n1\n The Bank objected to the account on the ground that the money was the proceeds of the sale \n\n[303 \nU.S. 350, 354]\n\u00a0\n of a crop covered by the chattel mortgage above referred to and that the disbursements from the fund were made without valid order by the District Court and without the Bank's notice or knowledge of any court order. It was further objected that after adjudication in bankruptcy under section 75(s) the conciliation commissioner had no jurisdiction. Petitioner stated in his answer and testimony that the items appearing prior to the adjudication in bankruptcy of January 7, 1935, were disbursed, on his orders as conciliation commissioner, either to gather the 1934 crop or to provide for care of the property, and that the items appearing from January 22 through June 1, 1935, were disbursed under the direction of the referee in bankruptcy. The District Court, finding that the expenditures of the conciliation commissioner were made in good faith and for the purpose of conserving the estate, settled and allowed the account. The Circuit Court of Appeals directed the disallowance of the account and the payment by the conciliation commissioner to the respondent of the gross proceeds of the mortgaged crop.\n First. The powers granted by the bankruptcy clause of the Constitution, article 1,  8, cl. 4, are not limited to the bankruptcy law and practice in force in England or the States at the time of its adoption. Continental Illinois Nat'l Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 648, 668\n, 55 S.Ct. 595, 603. Then the interests of the creditor alone were protected. Progressive liberalization of bankruptcy and insolvency laws, in an effort to avert the evils of liquidation, has furnished opportunity for composition in bankruptcy proceedings and later for composition and extension of debts in relief proceedings for individual debtors, for reorganization of railroads and other corporations, and for public debtor proceedings. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 350, 355]\n\u00a0\n Section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act3 provides similar opportunities for the rehabilitation of farmers. Wright v. Vinton Branch, \n300 \nU.S. 440, 456\n, 57 S.Ct. 556, 559. It is sought to accomplish this rehabilitation through composition or extension of debts, subsections (e) to (l) 47 Stat. 1471, 1472, 11 U.S.C.A.  203(e to l).\n On failure of composition and extension, further opportunity for rehabilitation is afforded the debtor, through provisions enabling him to retain possession of his property, under conditions favorable to its ultimate redemption by him. These steps are carried out under judicial supervision, subsection (s).4\n To accomplish its purpose, section 75 provides that the filing of a petition shall effect a stay. \n5\n Such a stay under \n\n[303 \nU.S. 350, 356]\n\u00a0\n judicial discretion as to enforcement of claims does not take property without due process and is constitutional. Continental Illinois Nat'l Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., supra, \n294 \nU.S. 648\n, at pages 675 et seq. and 680 et seq., 55 S.Ct. 595, 605, 608; Wright v. Vinton Branch, supra, \n300 \nU.S. 440, 460\n, 57 S.Ct. 556, 561; Home Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398\n, 54 S.Ct. 231, 88 A.L.R. 1481. In order to operate and protect the property during the stay, and pending confirmation or other disposition of the composition or extension proposal, the statute provides in subsections ( e) and (n)6 for the exercise by the court of 'such control \n\n[303 \nU.S. 350, 357]\n\u00a0\n over the property of the farmer as the court deems in the best interests of the farmer and his creditors.' These provisions look toward the maintenance of the farm as a going concern, and afford clear authority, in a proper case, for the continuance of the operations of the farm after the filing of a petition under section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act.\n Second. In holding the conciliation commissioner personally liable, we think the lower court misconceived the nature of his office. At the time of filing the original petition for composition and extension, August 6, 1934, section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act was comprised of subsections (a) to (s), inclusive. Subsections (a) to (r) made provision for conciliation commissioners, set up the same qualifications for eligibility to this office as are required for the office of deferee, authorized the conciliation commissioners to receive and transmit the petitions and schedules, to call the first meeting of creditors, with notice of terms of composition or extension, to hear the parties in interest, to prepare final inventory, to supervise the farmer's affairs during an extension period and to distribute the consideration after a composition. In accordance with section 75, subsection (b), this Court, as of April 24, 1933, established Rule L, 11 U.S.C.A. following section 53, governing proceedings under section 75(a) to (r) inclusive, as an addition to the General Orders in Bankruptcy, 288 U.S. at page 641. Rule L provided for reference to the conciliation commissioner, and his carrying out of the duties outlined above. The commissioner was given, in so far as consistent with section 75 and Rule L, 'all the powers and duties of a referee in bankruptcy,' to be carried out under the General Orders in Bankruptcy. Rule L, par. 11. Sections 38, as amended, and 39 of the Bankruptcy Act 11 U.S.C.A.  66, 67 and paragraphs 3 and 6 of Rule L indicate the wide extent of the authority of the conciliation commissioner. Under section 38, Bankruptcy Act, clause four, the referee is empowered to 'perform such part of the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 350, 358]\n\u00a0\n duties, except as to questions arising out of the applications of bankrupts for compositions or discharges, as are by this Act (title) conferred on courts of bankruptcy.' \n7\n\u00a0\n\n In view of the foregoing the conciliation commisioner had the authority, prior to the adjudication of bankruptcy under section 75(s), to act as the 'court,' in the first instance and subject to review, in controlling the property of the debtor 'in the best interests of the farmer and his creditors.' Section 75(e), 11 U.S.C.A.  203(e); In re Wiedmer, 7 Cir., 82 F.2d 566. Under this authority the conciliation commissioner acted in authorizing the expenditures shown on the account for gathering the crop of 1934, preparing for the crop of 1935, and paying fees and expenses. It is plain that the conciliation commissioner, like the referee (White v. Schloerb, \n178 \nU.S. 542, 546\n, 20 S.Ct. 1007; Mueller v. Nugent, \n184 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 22 S.Ct. 269) exercises some of the 'judicial authority' of the bankruptcy court. The acts just detailed were judicial acts. Error within his jurisdiction does not subject him to personal liability. Randall v. Brigham, 7 Wall. 523, 535. See, also, Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335; Alzua v. Johnson, \n231 \nU.S. 106\n, 34 S.Ct. 27; Yaselli v. Goff, \n275 \nU.S. 503\n, 48 S.Ct. 155. Cf. First Nat'l Bank of Ardmore v. Bonner, 10 Cir., 74 F.2d 139, 142; United States v. Ward, 8 Cir ., 257 F. 372, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 350, 359]\n\u00a0\n 377. This doctrine is quite clear when, as here, no rule or positive enactment was violated and the acts were bona fide.\n The fact that the proceeds of the crop were banked to the joint account of the debtor and the conciliation commissioner may have obscured the judicial character of the latter. Better practice would suggest that the account appear in the name of the debtor, with the counter-signature of the conciliation commissioner required for withdrawals. Also, at an early, preferably the first, meeting of creditors, the method of handling the business of the debtor pending confirmation or further order should have been developed and proper orders entered. Cf. Section 12a, Bankruptcy Act, as amended, 11 U.S.C.A.  30(a). This does not appear to have been done. These irregularities do not suffice to withdraw from the conciliation commissioner his judicial protection. Alzua v. Johnson, \n231 \nU.S. 106\n, 34 S.Ct. 27.\n Some disbursements were made after the adjudication in bankruptcy under subsection (s) and the reference of the proceedings to a referee in bankruptcy. It is unnecessary to decide whether, under section 75(s) as originally enacted, the conciliation commissioner could have continued to act as referee. In this case, there was no further reference of the proceedings to petitioner, and he continued to act solely at the direction of the referee in bankruptcy. His uncontradicted testimony was as follows: 'When this matter was referred to D. W. Richards, as referee I wanted him to take the money I had on hand and become the custodian of it. He asked me to keep the money and said he would trust me in the expenditure of the money while it was under him and that he would O.K. the checks, so all the checks that were written after it went to D. W. Richards were O. K.'d by him and I wrote the checks at his request.'\n Without determining the effect of the unconstitutionality of subsection (s) upon the steps taken under its \n\n[303 \nU.S. 350, 360]\n\u00a0\n authority, it appears that the petitioner acted either judicially, continuing to exercise his powers as conciliation commissioner, or ministerially, as an arm of the court, under the direction and with the approval of the referee. Under the facts of this case we do not think petitioner is personally liable for these disbursements. Cf. First Nat'l Bank of Ardmore v. Bonner, 10 Cir., 74 F.2d 139, 142.\n Third. Moreover, the expenditures assailed by respondent were proper, at least with respect to the principal items (which are the only ones we shall consider)-the amounts spent in harvesting the 1934 crop, which was sold in order to create the fund, and the amounts spent for preservation of the vineyard and for the cultivation of the 1935 crop. There is no showing that petitioner was improvident. Reference is made in his account to money paid to the farmer as 'living expenses,' but the record discloses that the amounts paid the debtor did not exceed the ordinary wages for the work he actually and necessarily performed in the maintenance of the vineyard. Compare Wright v. Vinton Branch, supra, \n300 \nU.S. 440\n, at page 466, 57 S.Ct. 556, 564; In re Barrow, D.C., 98 F. 582.\n The court below ruled that under the crop mortgage the farmer had the obligation to cultivate and harvest the crop at his own expense, and therefore the gross proceeds belonged to respondent. This conclusion disregards the fact that the debtor did not harvest the grapes as an ordinary mortgagor. He had come into court seeking relief under section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act. The filing of his petition put the property in the control of the court and the harvesting of the crop and the preservation of the property became a matter for the concern and action of the court.\n Respondent certainly cannot complain of the devotion of the proceeds of the 1934 crop to the cost of harvesting that crop. The care and harvesting of that crop represented the only way to preserve its worth (cf. Union \n\n[303 \nU.S. 350, 361]\n\u00a0\n Trust Co. of New York v. Illinois Midland R. Co., \n117 \nU.S. 434, 455\n, 6 S. Ct. 809), and the cost of protecting a fund in court is everywhere recognized as a dominant charge on that fund. See Bronson v. La Crosse & M.R. Co., 1 Wall. 405, 410; Shepherd v. Pepper, \n133 \nU.S. 626, 652\n, 10 S.Ct. 438; Thompson v. Phenix Ins. Co., \n136 \nU.S. 287, 293\n, 10 S.Ct. 1019; Atlantic Trust Co. v. Chapman, \n208 \nU.S. 360, 376\n, 28 S.Ct. 406, 13 Ann.Cas. 1155; Wright v. Vinton Branch, supra, \n300 \nU.S. 440\n, at page 468, 57 S.Ct. 556, 564. The rule applies even in ordinary bankruptcy proceedings8 since the secured creditor benefits from the disbursement. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n And since the creditor in this case had a lien on the crop for future years and on the real estate, we cannot say that the money expended for maintenance of the real estate and toward production of the 1935 crop was not likewise for its benefit. Compare Wright v. Vinton Branch, supra, \n300 \nU.S. 440\n, at page 468, 57 S.Ct. 556, 564.10 Respondent itself has \n\n[303 \nU.S. 350, 362]\n\u00a0\n suggested, in another connection (see Bank of America National Trust & Savings Ass'n v. Cuccia, supra), that the grape vines require 'cultivation, pruning and care,' lest they 'deterioriate.' It is unnecessary to determine the effect of an expenditure of the proceeds of a crop where the mortgagee has no lien on the property preserved and protected by the expenditures.\n The decree is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Account-Filed February 17, 1936 \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Bankruptcy Act of 1867, as amended by the Act of 1874, c. 390,  17, 18 Stat. 178, 182; Act of March 3, 1933, c. 204, 47 Stat. 1467, 11 U.S.C.A .  101a, 201-205 and notes; Act of June 7, 1934, c. 424, 48 Stat. 911, 11 U.S.C.A.  76a, 103 and note, 103a, 107(f), 202-204 and notes, 206, 207 and note; Act of June 28, 1934, c. 869, 48 Stat. 1289, 11 U.S.C.A.  203 note; Act of April 10, 1936, c. 186, 49 Stat. 1198, 11 U.S.C.A.  302; Act of April 11, 1936, c. 210, 49 Stat. 1203, 11 U.S.C.A.  303(a, d); Act of August 16, 1937, 50 Stat. 654, 11 U.S.C.A.  401 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Subsections (a) to (r) were added by the Act of March 3, 1933, c. 204,  1, 47 Stat. 1470-1473, and subsections (a) and (b) amended by the Act of June 7, 1934, c. 424,  8 and 9, 48 Stat. 911, 925, 11 U.S.C.A.  203(a, b).

In proceedings under this section, except as otherwise provided herein, the jurisdiction and powers of the court, the title, powers, and duties of its officers, the duties of the farmer, and the rights and liabilities of creditors, and of all persons with respect to the property of the farmer and the jurisdiction of the appellate courts, shall be the same as if a voluntary petition for adjudication had been filed and a decree of adjudication had been entered on the day when the farmer's petition or answer was filed.' 47 Stat. 1473.\n\n Subsection (e) has never been amended. Subsection (n) was amended, in respects not material here, by the Act of August 28, 1935,  4, c. 792, 49 Stat. 942, 11 U.S.C.A.  203(n). \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 'Applications of bankrupts for compositions,' as used in this clause, does not refer to proceedings of debtor for rehabilitation under section 75. And even under section 12, as amended, 11 U.S.C.A.  30, the referee has authority to proceed with steps preliminary to the application for confirmation of the composition proposal. Cf. General Order XII, paragraph 3, 11 U.S.C.A. following section 53; In re Bloodworth-Stembridge Co., D.C., 178 F. 372.\n Rule 77 of the District Court for the Southern District of California reads as follows: 'Rule 77.-Jurisdiction of Referees. It is ordered that the Referees in Bankruptcy of said Court be, and they are hereby vested with jurisdiction in all bankruptcy cases within the limits of their respective counties, to perform all the duties conferred on Courts of Bankruptcy, which Referees may be required or authorized to perform; except as otherwise provided by General Order in Bankruptcy No. XII.' \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Though the court orders a sale free of liens without the consent of the lienholder, the cost of preserving the property is deducted before the proceeds are turned over to him.

Paragraph 2 provides:\n\n\"Such rental shall be paid into court, to be used, first, for payment of taxes and upkeep of the property, and the remainder to be distributed among the secured and unsecured creditors, and applied on their claims, as their interests may appear.'\n\n'It is suggested that payment of taxes and keeping the property in repair takes the income from the mortgagee, and that the mortgagor alone may be benefited thereby; that if the mortgagor exercises the option to purchase the property at its appraised value, he will secure the property free of tax liens which otherwise might have accrued against it. But it must be assumed that the mortgagor will not get the property for less than its actual value. The Act provides that upon the creditor's request the property must be reappraised, or sold at public auction; and the mortgagee may by bidding at such sale fully protect his interest. Nonpayment of taxes may imperil the title. Payments for upkeep are essential to the preservation of the property. These payments prescribed by the Act are in accordance with the common practice in foreclosure proceedings where the property is in the hands of receivers.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nADAM v. SAENGER(1938)\nNo. 197\nArgued: January 6, 1938Decided: January 31, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 59, 60]\n\u00a0\n Mr. M. G. Adams, of Beaumont, Tex., for petitioner.\n Mr. Oliver J. Todd, of Beaumont, Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether the action, in this case, of the Texas state courts, in dismissing a suit founded upon a judgment of the Supreme Court of California, denied to the judgment the faith and credit which the Constitution, article 4,  1, commands.\n Petitioner, as assignee of a California judgment against the Beaumont Export & Import Company, a Texas corporation, brought the present suit in the Texas state district court against respondents, directors of the corporation acting as its trustees in dissolution, and against its stockholders as transferees of corporate assets, to collect the judgment. His petition sets out in detail the circumstances attending the rendition of the California judg- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 59, 61]\n\u00a0\n ment and incorporates by reference a duly attested copy of the judgment roll.\n It appears that the corporation brought suit in the superior court of California, a court of general jurisdiction, against Montes, petitioner's predecessor in interest, to recover a money judgment for goods sold and delivered. Thereupon Montes, following what is alleged to be the California practice, with leave of the court brought a cross-action against the corporation, by service of a cross-complaint upon the corporation's attorney of record in the pending suit, to recover for the conversion of chattels. Judgment in the cross-action, taken by default, was followed by dismissal of the corporation's suit and is the judgment which is the subject of the present suit. A motion to open the default and to be allowed to defend, made later on behalf of the corporation, was contested and was denied by the court, the issue being whether the cross- complaint was in fact served on the plaintiff's attorney.\n The trial court sustained a general demurrer to the complaint and gave judgment dismissing the cause, which the Texas Court of Civil Appeals affirmed, 101 S.W.2d 1046. Petition to the Texas Supreme Court for a writ of error was denied for want of jurisdiction. We granted certiorari, \n302 \nU.S. 668\n, 58 S.Ct. 28, 82 L.Ed. --; cf. Bain Peanut Co. v. Pinson, 282 U.s,. 499, 51 S.Ct. 228, the question being an important one of constitutional law. Our writ is properly directed to the Texas Court of Civil Appeals, it being the highest court of the state in which a judgment could be had. Bacon v.

Levee, \n263 \nU.S. 19\n, 44 S.Ct. 11.\n The Texas Court of Civil Appeals rested its decision on a single ground, want of jurisdiction of the California court over the corporation in the cross-action in which the judgment was rendered. Construing the California statutes \n\n[303 \nU.S. 59, 62]\n\u00a0\n and decisions which the complaint set out, it concluded that they did not authorize service of the complaint in the cross-action upon the plaintiff's attorney of record. It held further that in any case as the corporation was not present within the state no jurisdiction could be acquired over it by the substituted service, and the California judgment was consequently without due process and a nullity beyond the protection of the full faith and credit clause. To review these rulings we brought the case here. Cf. Ward v. Love County, \n253 \nU.S. 17, 25\n, 40 S.Ct. 419, 422; Indiana ex rel. Anderson v. Brand, \n303 \nU.S. 95\n, 58 S.Ct. 443, decided this day.\n By R.S.  905, 28 U.S.C.  687, 28 U.S.C.A.  687, enacted under authority of the full faith and credit clause, article 4, section 1, of the Constitution, the duly attested record of the judgment of a state is entitled to such faith and credit in every court within the United States as it has by law or usage in the state from which it is taken. If it appears on its face to be a record of a court of general jurisdiction, such jurisdiction over the cause and the parties is to be presumed unless disproved by extrinsic evidence, or by the record itself. Hanley v. Donoghue, \n116 \nU.S. 1\n, 6 S.Ct. 242; Knowles v. Logansport Gaslight & Coke Co., 19 Wall. 58; Settlemier v. Sullivan, \n97 \nU.S. 444\n. But in a suit upon the judgment of another state the jurisdiction of the court which rendered it is open to judicial inquiry, Chicago Life Insurance Co. v. Cherry, \n244 \nU.S. 25\n, 37 S.Ct. 492, and when the matter of fact or law on which jurisdiction depends was not litigated in the original suit it is a matter to be adjudicated in the suit founded upon the judgment. Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. 457. Here the fact of the service of the complaint upon the attorney is alleged by the petitioner and admitted by the demurrer, but the court's conclusion that the California court was without jurisdiction, resting in part upon its construction of the California statutes, presents an issue not litigated in the California suit which must be determined in the present one. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 59, 63]\n\u00a0\n Congress has not prescribed the manner in which the legal effect of the judgment and the proceedings on which it is founded in the state where rendered are to be ascertained by the courts of another state. It has left that to the applicable procedure of the courts in which they are drawn in question. Where they are in issue this Court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction to review cases coming to it from state courts, takes judicial notice of the law of the several states to the same extent that such notice is taken by the court from which the appeal is taken. 'Whatever was matter of law in the court appealed from is matter of law here, and whatever was matter of fact in the court appealed from is matter of fact here.' Hanley v. Donoghue, supra, \n116 \nU.S. 1\n, at page 6, 6 S.Ct. 242, 245.\n According to Texas law the legal effect of the judgment of another state, on which suit is brought is to be determined by the court, not the jury. But a suitor who asserts that the force and effect of the judgment is different from that of a similar judgment of the courts of the state is required to allege specifically and prove as matter of fact the particular laws or usage on which he relies to establish the difference, and on demurrer only the law or usage specifically alleged will be considered in determining whether the law of another state differs from that of Texas. Porcheler v. Bronson, 50 Tex. 555; Gill v. Everman, 94 Tex. 209, 59 S.W. 531; National Bank of Commerce v. Kenney, 98 Tex. 293, 83 S.W. 368.\n In the present suit petitioner, in conformity to the state procedure, has set out in his complaint the California statutes and the citations of the decisions of California courts which he contends establish the law of that state that a cross-action in a pending suit may be begun by service of a cross-complaint upon the plaintiff's attorney. The question thus raised upon demurrer for decision by the court is the legal effect in California of the service, and hence of the judgment founded upon it. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 59, 64]\n\u00a0\n Whether the question be regarded as one of fact or more precisely and accurately as a question of law to be determined as are other questions of law, although procedural exigencies require it to be presented by the pleading and proof, as are issues of fact, it is one arising under the Constitution and a statute of the United States which commands that such faith and credit shall be given by every court to the California proceedings 'as they have by law or usage' of that state. And since the existence of the federal right turns on the meaning and effect of the California statute, the decision of the Texas court on that point, whether of law or of fact, is reviewable here.

This is especially the case where the decision is rested, not on local law or matters of fact of the usual type, which are peculiarly within the cognizance of the local courts, but upon the law of another state, as readily determined here as in a state court. Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 \nU.S. 657, 684\n, 13 S.Ct. 224; Yarborough v. Yarborough, 168 S.C. 46, 166 S.E. 877; Id., \n290 \nU.S. 202\n, 54 S.Ct. 181, 90 A.L.R. 924.\n In ruling that the service in the California suit was unauthorized, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals said: \n\n[303 \nU.S. 59, 65]\n\u00a0\n 'The cross-action was not an ancillary proceeding, but an independent suit in which a final judgment could be rendered without awaiting a decision in the original suit. Farar v. Steenbergh, 173 Cal. 94, 159 P. 707. It is well settled in this state that a cross-action occupies the attitude of an independent suit and requires service of the cross-action upon the cross- defendant. Harris v. Schlinke, 95 Tex. 88, 65 S.W. 172. This being so, in the absence of a waiver of service, or an appearance by the cross- defendant, personal service on the cross-defendant must be had to confer jurisdiction upon the court to determine the matter and render judgment in the case.'\n But the question presented by the pleadings is the status of a cross- action under the California statutes, not under those of Texas. We think its status is adequately disclosed by the California statutes and decisions pleaded by petitioner, and is that for which he contends.\n Section 442 of the California Code of Civil Procedure specifically provides that a defendant may secure affirmative relief upon 'cross- complaint' which 'must be served upon the parties affected thereby,' and requires service of 'summons upon the cross-complaint' only upon such parties as 'have not appeared in the action.' \n1\n Arguing that 'action' means only 'cross-action' and not the original action brought by the plaintiff, the Texas court con- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 59, 66]\n\u00a0\n cluded that a plaintiff who has not appeared in the cross-action must be served with summons 'as upon the commencement of an original action.' But the word 'action,' even if susceptible of such meaning, cannot be so interpreted in the face of the pleaded California decisions which hold that a cross-complaint may be served on the attorney of one who is already a party to the original action. Farrar v. Steenbergh, 173 Cal. 94, 159 P. 707; Wood v. Johnston, 8 Cal.App. 258, 96 P. 508; Ritter v. Braash, 11 Cal. App. 258, 104 P. 592.\n Section 1015, as amended by St.Cal.1933, p. 1899, provides that in all cases where a party, whether resident or nonresident, has an attorney in an action, 'the service of papers, when required, must be upon the attorney instead of the party, except service of subpenas, of writs, and other process issued in the suit, and of papers to bring him into contempt.' 2 The Texas Court of Civil Appeals construed this section as requiring 'service of subpenas, of writs, and other process issued in the suit' upon the party rather than the attorney, and as including the cross-complaint in the terms 'writ' and 'process.' But assuming that a cross-complaint served without summons may be so characterized, it is clear that the section does not by its terms preclude valid service \n\n[303 \nU.S. 59, 67]\n\u00a0\n of the cross-complaint upon the attorney for a party which, as we have seen, section 442 permits. Section 1015 directs service upon the attorney of all but the three types of papers excepted, but says nothing as to the effectiveness of service of those papers upon him. Section 1011, as amended by St.Cal.1933, p. 1898, set out in the pleading though not referred to in the court's opinion, reads, 'Notices and papers, when and how served. The service may be personal, by delivery to the party or attorney on whom the service is required to be made.'\n The question whether section 1015 does forbid service of a cross- complaint on the attorney has been definitely answered in the negative by the Supreme Court of California, which, in Farrar v. Steenbergh, supra, 173 Cal. 94, 97, 159 P. 707, 708, held, 'Service of a cross-complaint upon a plaintiff who appears by an attorney is not made by a summons to the plaintiff, but by delivery of a copy of the cross-complaint to the attorney.' Upon this ground the California District Court of Appeals, in cases, on which petitioner relies, has sustained judgments taken upon default in a cross-action begun by service of the cross-complaint on the plaintiff's attorney. Ritter v. Braash, supra; Wood v. Johnston, supra. Upon all the pleaded evidence of the California law, to the consideration of which we are restricted by the present state of the record, we think the only inference to be drawn is that the service in the California suit was authorized by California law.\n There is nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment to prevent a state from adopting a procedure by which a judgment in personam may be rendered in a cross-action against a plaintiff in its courts, upon service of process or of appropriate pleading upon his attorney of record. The plaintiff having, by his voluntary act in demanding justice from the defendant, submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court, there is nothing arbitrary or unreasonable in treating him as being there for all purposes \n\n[303 \nU.S. 59, 68]\n\u00a0\n for which justice to the defendant requires his presence. It is the price which the state may exact as the condition of opening its courts to the plaintiff. Young Company v. McNeal-Edwards Co., \n283 \nU.S. 398, 400\n, 51 S.Ct. 538, 539; compare Chicago & Northwestern Railway Co. v.

The cross-complaint must be served upon the parties affected thereby, and such parties may demur or answer thereto as to the original complaint.

NAGLE(1938)\nNo. 123\nArgued: Decided: March 28, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 532, 533]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Wainwright, George P. Barse, and Brice Clagett, all of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Lemuel B. Schofield, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 532, 534]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are stockholders' suits to enjoin the receiver of two national banks from enforcing assessments ordered by the Comptroller of the Currency pursuant to the statute governing the additional liability of shareholders. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The respondents in No. 123 are stockholders of the Penn National Bank & Trust Company of Reading, Pa.; those in No. 124 are stockholders of the Reading National Bank & Trust Company of the same city; and the petitioner is receiver of both banks. The controversy has its origin in a transaction between the two banks and the Farmers National Bank & Trust Company of Reading. The causes of action are identical, and it will suffice to outline the allegations of the bill in No. 123. These are:\n On February 17, 1933, Penn and Reading were subjected to unusual withdrawals which depleted their reserves and placed both on the verge of insolvency. Due to this condition the two banks on that date entered into an agreement with the Farmers contemplating a consolidation of the three in accordance with title 12 U.S.C.  33 and 34, 12 U.S.C.A.  33, 34. The agreement called for a valuation of the assets of the three banks with ensuing recapitalization and for the Comptroller's approval of the terms of consolidation as required by law. It further provided for transfer by Penn and Reading of all their assets to Farmers, with the right to hypothecate and rehypothecate them, and for assumption by Farmers of the liabilities of the transferring banks, except that to stockholders; they reserving the right to enforce against their stockholders any statutory excess liability. Farmers was to operate \n\n[303 \nU.S. 532, 535]\n\u00a0\n their banking houses as its branches. On the same day Penn and Reading turned over their assets to Farmers which mingled them with its own and thereafter dealt with them as its own. There is no assertion that on February 17 the Comptroller knew, or approved, of the agreement and transfer. It is alleged, however, that, by his direction, a supplemental agreement was made February 20, 1933, by which Penn and Reading guaranteed to Farmers that the assets of each would exceed in value its liabilities assumed by Farmers under the agreement of February 17; and that he acquiesced in the continued administration of the affairs of Penn and Reading by Farmers. On February 17 the assets of Penn which were transferred to Farmers had a reasonable market net value of $5,400,000 as against total liabilities of $5,100,000, and the assets of Farmers were of the fair value of $8,000,000 (to which is to be added the stockholders' liability for assessment in the amount of $1,000,000), as against liability to creditors of $9,000,000. 2 The claims of the two banks against Farmers were, at the date of transfer, and still are, more than sufficient, in the ordinary course of liquidation, to pay all of their liabilities without the necessity of an assessment of the stockholders.\n Farmers continued to do business with the combined and commingled assets from February 17 to March 18, 1933. Then the Comptroller appointed a conservator who took possession of all of the assets. October 10, 1933, the Comptroller, without notice to Penn or Reading, their depositors, creditors, or stockholders, and without a hearing, ruled that the agreements of February 17 and February 20 were without legal effect, and directed that the transfer and delivery of the assets, and the assumption of liabilities thereunder, should be disregarded; and \n\n[303 \nU.S. 532, 536]\n\u00a0\n he attempted to allocate among the three banks the assets theretofore transferred and delivered to Farmers. He appointed the same person he had previously named conservator for Farmers to be conservator of the other two banks. October 20, 1933, the Comptroller proposed a so-called plan of reorganization of the three banks which provided for the organization of a new national bank, the issue by it of stock and securities, the pledge of some of its assets to secure a loan from Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a sale of the assets in the possession of the conservator of Farmers to the new national bank, and a division of the proceeds on the basis of 35 per cent. to Farmers, 25 per cent. to Penn, and 25 per cent. to Reading. It is charged that this division was arbitrary and was based on a classification adopted from the report of national bank examiners dated April 24, 1933, and not on the financial condition of the banks as of February 17, 1933, the date of the execution of the agreement, transfer of assets, and assumption of liabilities. The conservator of all three banks, in furtherance of the plan, reconstructed the assets and liabilities of each as of April 24, 1933, made a division thereof amongst the banks, consummated the sale to the new bank, and apportioned the proceeds according to the plan. In so doing, in conformity with the Comptroller's ruling, he disregarded all rights and obligations arising from the agreement of February 17, 1933, and disregarded the claim of Penn, in the amount of $5,100,000, and the claim of Reading, in the amount of $9, 000,000, against Farmers. The bills charge that this conduct was arbitrary, and that the Comptroller's ruling respecting the two agreements was beyond the powers conferred upon him by the National Bank Act or other statutory law, was an unlawful assumption of judicial powers not delegated to him by statute, or capable of being so delegated, was in violation of the rights of Penn and Reading, their depositors, other \n\n[303 \nU.S. 532, 537]\n\u00a0\n creditors, and stockholders, and deprived them of their property without due process of law.\n After consummation of the plan of reorganization the Comptroller certified that each of the three banks was insolvent and, in October and November, 1934, appointed a receiver for each of them. January 15, 1935, he certified that, upon a proper accounting by the receivers of Penn and Reading, and a valuation of the uncollected assets remaining in their hands, it appeared that a 100 per cent. assessment was necessary to pay their debts, and he accordingly ordered such an assessment. The bills characterize his conduct as a failure, neglect, and refusal to collect the claims of Penn and Reading against Farmers and a consequent failure to comply with the conditions and provisions of the statute authorizing assessments of stockholders, and as 'in fraud of the rights' of Penn and Reading, their creditors and stockholders. His ignoring the claims is charged to have been 'a grave error of law based upon his unwarranted assumption of judicial power in abrogating, cancelling, and waiving' the claims of Penn and Reading against Farmers, and 'adjudicating the private rights and obligations of parties not subject to his power and control,' which invalidated the assessments.\n The receiver interposed motions to dismiss which were sustained by the District Court. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed,3 holding the bills set forth a cause of action since, if thier allegations were true, the Comptroller had exceeded his statutory power and acted arbitrarily in ordering the assessments. The importance of the question involved and asserted conflict of decision moved us to grant certiorari. \n302 \nU.S. 665\n, 58 S.Ct. 18, 82 L.Ed. --; \n302 \nU.S. 665\n, 58 S.Ct. 19, 82 L.Ed. --.\n The petitioner's position is that the agreement and transfer of assets to the Farmers did not effect a statutory consolidation; that the Comptroller was, there- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 532, 538]\n\u00a0\n fore, at liberty to treat all three banks as separate entities for the purpose of assessing stockholders' liability; and that stockholders may not, by a proceeding in equity, challenge his official findings as to insolvency and necessity for an assessment. The respondents say the Comptroller's power of assessment is conditioned on a basic or quasi jurisdiction fact, that the ordinary resources of a bank have been exhausted, and, if they have not been, or are deficient only because of the Comptroller's unlawful abrogation of and refusal to require collection of a valid claim sufficient to pay the bank's debts, the assessment is subject to direct attack as in excess of that officer's statutory power, as arbitrary, capricious, and a denial of due process of law. We are of opinion that the assessments were not subject to attack or frustration in these proceedings upon the grounds set forth in the bills.\n\n 1. \nThe agreements of February 17 and February 20 did not effect a consolidation in conformity with the National Banking Act so as to constitute the existing stockholders of Penn and Reading, together with the stockholders of Farmers, stockholders of a consolidated bank. The steps requisite to such consolidation were never taken. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n 2. \nWhen the Comptroller took charge of the banks in question he was bound to deal with them, so far as their assets and liabilities were concerned and in respect of stockholders' liability, upon the basis that they were three separate associations. This conclusion is unaffected by the legality and effectiveness of the agreement of February 17, 1933, upon which respondents insist. \n5\n At most the agreement substituted a new asset- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 532, 539]\n\u00a0\n the promise of Farmers-for the old assets. Respondents do not claim that the contract and the transfer pursuant to it worked a novation whereby the creditors of the transferring banks became creditors of the transferee. So far as the Comptroller was concerned, these creditors were still those of the former and entitled to look to their assets for payment.\n\n 3. \nWhether the Comptroller took the view that the contracts and what was done under them were effective to commute the physical assets of Penn and Reading into a chose in action against Farmers, or that the transaction did not so operate but left Penn and Reading owners of their assets so far as they could be identified and segregated, it was not, as respondents suggest, a condition precedent to the validity of his assessment that he should have exhausted the assets of Penn and Reading.\n At the argument the position was taken that the Comptroller was without power to lay an assessment until he had gotten in the avails of all the ordinary assets of the banks, and that the claims of Penn and Reading against Farmers under the contract of February 17 were such ordinary assets. The conclusion is that until the receiver of Penn and Reading had recovered upon the contract and distributed the proceeds the Comptroller was without power to order an assessment. No decision of any court was cited to support this position, but it was sought to maintain it by reference to an amendment of the National Bank Act of June 3, 1864,6 offered and adopted in the Senate. The purpose of this amendment was stated to be to 'enable the receiver at any time whenever it becomes necessary, to enforce the individual liability; and in case it is not necessary, if the other assets are sufficient, he will not enforce this contingent liability, which is intended as an ultimate security of the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 532, 540]\n\u00a0\n creditors of the bank' We think the adoption of the amendment in the light of the explanation is far from sustaining the respondents' contention. It has always been recognized that if the assets of a closed national bank are sufficient to answer its liabilities the Comptroller is not to levy an assessment, but to him is confided the determination of the sufficiency of the assets and, if he concludes they are insufficient, it is not only his right but his duty immediately to invoke the contingent liability of the stockholders. This has been the invariable administrative practice, and any other would tend to depreciate the availability and the value of stockholders' liability.\n\n 4. \nThe question remains whether, if the Comptroller's action arose from mistake of fact or law, the remedy here invoked is appropriate. In establishing the national banking system Congress has invested the Comptroller, an administrative officer, with jurisdiction to appoint a receiver after investigation and a finding that a bank has become insolvent, and to order an assessment up to 100 per cent. of the par value of the stock against the shareholders to pay creditors' claims if, upon an investigation, he finds that the assets are insufficient to pay the debts. Plainly, these are questions for the exercise of administrative discretion. The necessity for vesting this power in an administrative officer springs from the desirability of prompt liquidation. It would be intolerable if the Comptroller's decision could be attacked collaterally in every suit by a receiver against the shareholders to collect the amount of the assessment. It is settled this cannot be done. \n7\n It would be equally intolerable if stockholders as a class could call upon a court to review the Comptroller's exercise of his discretion. For a court to entertain a suit for this purpose would be \n\n[303 \nU.S. 532, 541]\n\u00a0\n to render nugatory the functions Congress has confided in the Comptroller. It has often been decided this may not be done. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The respondents, however, urge and the bill charges, that the Comptroller, in ruling that the contract of February 17 should be disregarded, and the receiver, in following this ruling, exceeded their statutory powers and acted arbitrarily and may be enjoined from enforcing an assessment based on the ruling. The contention rests upon a statement in United States v. Knox, \n102 \nU.S. 422\n, 425: 'Although assessments made by the comptroller, under the circumstances of the first assessment in this case, and all other assessments, successive or otherwise, not exceeding the par value of all the stock of the bank, are conclusive upon the stockholders, yet if he were to attempt to enforce one made, clearly and palpably, contrary to the views we have expressed, it cannot be doubted that a court of equity, if its aid were invoked, would promptly restrain him by injunction.' This was said in a case where a creditor sought a mandamus to compel the Comptroller to order an assessment; he having refused so to do on the ground that the very terms of the statute forbade such action. Relying on this expression a number of the federal courts have said that, while an assessment may not be collaterally attacked, it may be voided by direct attack for 'clear error of law, fraud or mistake.' \n9\n Respondents admit this statement is too broad. Other courts \n\n[303 \nU.S. 532, 542]\n\u00a0\n have said that the only ground of successful attack is fraud on the part of the Comptroller. \n10\n This case presents no such basis for relief. The bills do not charge bad faith or fraud on the part of the Comptroller. The averment that his ruling with respect to the contract of February 17 and the consequent action of the receiver were 'in fraud' of the rights of Penn and Reading and their stockholders falls far short of any charge of actual fraud. Indeed no suggestion of such fraud was advanced by respondents either in brief or in argument.\n The respondents rely upon decisions holding that a bill in equity or a writ of mandamus will lie to compel an executive officer to comply with the plain mandate of a statute. These have no application for they deal with a situation wholly foreign to that here presented. Where a statute vests no discretion in an executive officer but to act under a given set of circumstances, or forbids his acting except upon certain named conditions, a court will compel him to act or to refrain from acting if he essays wholly to disregard the statutory mandate; but if a discretion is vested in him, and he is to act in the light of the facts he ascertains and the judgment he forms, a court cannot restrain him from acting on the ground that he has exceeded his jurisdiction by reason of an error either of fact or law which induced his conclusion. Plainly, therefore, the respondents are wrong in asserting that as the facts set forth in their bill charge the Comptroller with an error of law, he exceeded his authority.\n The respondents further insist that their allegation that the Comptroller's action was 'arbitrary,' which is amplified and given content by the facts alleged and admitted by the motion to dismiss, requires a decree avoiding the assessment. The epithet 'arbitrary,' used in this \n\n[303 \nU.S. 532, 543]\n\u00a0\n connection, can mean no more than do the other averments that the Comptroller, in reaching his conclusion, 'committed grave error of law' in failing to regard the contract of February 17 as effective. It would be arbitrary, in the proper sense of the term, for an official to act in the teeth of a statute or stubbornly to refuse to act at all where a statute commands action, but where he essays to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon him, though his errors may be subject to subsequent correction, they cannot be enjoined as an arbitrary exercise of his authority. To hold otherwise would render orderly administrative procedure impossible.\n A reference to the situation with which the Comptroller was confronted when his receiver took charge of the banks will serve to demonstrate that a case was presented calling for the exercise of his discretion. The bill asserts that over a substantial period subsequent to the transfer of Penn's and Reading's assets to Farmers these were intermingled with Farmers' assets. It avers that an attempted segregation of assets was made upon the basis of a report of bank examiners dated April 24, 1933, more than two months after the transfer; it alleges that, at the date of transfer, Farmers owed $9,000,000 against which it had assets of $8,000,000 and a possible recovery by way of stockholders' liability of an additional million dollars; it fails to state what the condition of Farmers was when a conservator was appointed for it; what its condition was when a receiver was appointed for it; what its financial status is to-day. The pleader contents himself with the statement of a conclusion that the 'claims' of Penn and Reading against Farmers were, at the time of transfer of their assets, and still are, sufficient in amount to pay all of those banks' creditors. But if the allegation is true, the only conclusion to be drawn from it is that in ordering the assessment the Comptroller erroneously estimated the value of the banks' assets. Whatever may be \n\n[303 \nU.S. 532, 544]\n\u00a0\n thought of the legality of the transfer of assets pursuant to directors' action on the eve of insolvency, the creditors of Penn and Reading were not bound to look to Farmers and might prefer to look to the assets transferred or to so much of them as could be traced. And there well may have been reason for the Comptroller to doubt the legal efficacy of the transfer in the face of creditors' attack. These and other matters were to be considered by him in arriving at an informed judgment as to the availability and value of the assets of Penn and Reading to answer the claims of their creditors. As an exercise of the discretionary power vested in him, the Comptroller's action must be treated as final and conclusive as to the necessity for an assessment.\n\n 5. \nIf the Comptroller's decision with respect to the contract of February 17 was erroneous as matter of law the stockholders may or may not have a remedy. But their remedy is not to attack, or seek to evade payment of, the assessment. The collection of the assessment cannot be be made to await the outcome of litigation of that question. Moreover, if, as they assert, the Comptroller's judgment is wrong and the assets of Penn and Reading, consisting of their claims under the contract, are sufficient to pay their creditors, the amounts paid pursuant to the assessments will be returned to stockholders in final liquidation. Meantime, however, the creditors, the protection of whose interests is the primary object of the statute, will have been paid and, as is right, reimbursement of the stockholders will await possible realization upon assets which the Comptroller believes insufficient to satisfy the creditors.\n The decrees are reversed and the causes remanded, with instructions to dismiss the bills.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] R.S.  5151, Act of Dec. 23, 1913, c. 6,  23, 38 Stat. 273, U.S.C. tit. 12,  63 and 64, 12 U.S.C.A.  63, 64. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The bill in No. 124 alleges that on the same day Reading's assets exceeded in value its liabilities of approximately $9,000,000. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Nagle v.

UNITED FRUIT CO.(1938)\nNo. 773\nArgued: Decided: May 23, 1938\n\n\n\n\n\n[304 \nU.S. 430, 432]\n\u00a0\n Mr. D. Roger Englar, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Cletus Keating, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is how far hull insurers upon a valued marine insurance policy are entitled, in case of total loss, to participate by way of subrogation in a recovery by the insured against a tortfeasor responsible for the loss.\n In 1918 petitioners with several other underwriters, insured the hull of respondent's vessel, the Almirante, by policies in which it was agreed that the value of the hull was $632,610, materially less than its true value. The policies provided for a stipulated indemnity to the owner 'irrespective of the value of the vessel,' and that the owner was free to effect other insurance to any amount and without disclosure of the amounts so insured. As the total of the valued policies was $582,002.25, respondent was co-insurer for about $50,000; and so far as the valued hull policies were concerned it was uninsured, to the extent of any loss, in excess of the stipulated value. As protection against these risks, respondent procured from English underwriters additional P.P.I. (policy proof of interest) insurance, aggregating 65,105, partly upon hull and partly against other losses incidental to total loss of the vessel. The P. P.I. policies waived all rights of subrogation and were 'honor' policies, concededly payable only at the option of the insurers because unenforceable under the Act of Parliament of December 31, 1906,  4. Edwards & Co. v. Motor Union Insurance Co., (1922) 2 K.B.D. 249. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 430, 433]\n\u00a0\n In 1918 the Almirante became a total loss as the result of a collision with the steamship Hisko, a vessel belonging to the United States Government. The underwriters of both the valued policies and the P. P.I. policies paid them in full. The former joined with respondent in retaining attorneys to press the calims for collision damages against the United States. Suit brought against the United States under a special act of Congress, resulted in a recovery which included $1,750,000 as the value of the vessel, but without interest since the act did not authorize allowance of interest. Compare Boston Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 41, 47\n, 49 S.Ct. 52, 53. Distribution of the proceeds of the suit was made in accordance with a computation by insurance adjusters who apportioned the expenses of the suit among respondent and the underwriters, and allotted to the latter the amounts they had paid on their policies without interest, less their respective shares of the expenses.\n Petitioners, who are underwriters on some of the valued hull policies, brought the present suit in the district court for southern New York to participate in respondent's recovery against the United States. Relying on the valuation clause of their policies as conclusively fixing the value of the vessel for all purposes of the adjustment, they contest the allotment, insisting that they should bear no part of the expenses, and that they are entitled to interest on the amounts of their policies from the several dates on which they were paid. They also make, but do not stress here, the point that the hull insurers are entitled to the whole recovery. The district court gave judgment for the fll amount which petitioners had paid on their policies without deduction for expenses, but without addition of interest. 18 F.Supp. 441. On appeal by both parties, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that petitioners were entitled to neither \n\n[304 \nU.S. 430, 434]\n\u00a0\n interest nor expenses, and modified the judgment accordingly. 2 Cir., 92 F. 2d 576. We granted certiorari, \n303 \nU.S. 631\n, 58 S.Ct. 751, 82 L.Ed. --, because of the admitted conflict of the decision below with that of the Court of Queen's Bench in North of England, ect., Insurance Ass'n v. Armstrong (1870) L.R. 5 Q.B. 244. See Queen Insurance Co. v. Globe & Rutgers Fire Insurance Co., \n263 \nU.S. 487, 493\n, 44 S.Ct. 175, 176; Gulf Refining Co. v. Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co., \n279 \nU.S. 708, 715\n, 49 S.C. 439, 441.\n Petitioners' argument turns upon their contention that the valuation clause, either by estoppel or by contract, is conclusive between the parties for all purposes and that as respondent has recovered from the Government more than the stipulated value of the vessel, petitioners are entitled to the benefit of the recovery, at least to the full extent of the payments on their policies with interest. We think that the valuation clause in its usual form does not operate as an estoppel or by agreement to foreclose proof that actual value exceeds agreed value when the question is of the insurer's right to subrogation. The application of the agreed value to the insurance adjustment does not depend upon estoppel, Gulf Refining Co. v. Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co., supra, page 712, 49 S. Ct. page 440; British & Foreign Marine Insurance Co. v. Maldonado & Co., 9 Cir., 182 F. 744, and there can be no basis for an estoppel at least where, as here, the policy provisions undertake to indemnify the insured irrespective of the value of the vessel and contemplate that the insured may effect other insurance. The valuation stipulation fixes in advance of loss the value of the vessel, so as to avoid the necessity of proof of value in order to establish the extent of the liability assumed on the policy. The agreed value, honestly arrived at, thus stands in the place of prime value under an open marine policy, Gulf Refining Co. v. Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co., supra, page 711, 49 S.Ct. page 440; St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co. v. Pure Oil Co., 2 Cir., 63 F.2d 771, and resembles, in its practical operation, a stipulation for liquidated damages. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 430, 435]\n\u00a0\n But beyond its controlling effect in determining the insurance liability, the clause does not operate to exclude proof of actual value when relevant. Even in an action on the policy the actual rather than the agreed value has been held to be controlling for the purpose of determining whether there is a constructive total loss. Bradlie v. Maryland Insurance Co., 12 Pet. 378, 399; Irving v. Manning, 6 C.B. 391 (H. of L.). In the case of partial insurance of cargo under a valued policy the insured is treated as a co-insurer and is allowed to recover on the policy only such proportion of the loss as the insured value bears to the actual value, a computation which necessarily requires proof of the actual value in order to establish the coinsurance relationship. Gulf Refining Co. v. Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co., supra, 710-711, 49 S.Ct. page 440; see International Navigation Co. v. Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co., D.C., 100 F. 304, 318, affirmed per curiam 2 Cir., 108 F. 987; Arnould on Marine Insurance, 11th Edition,  340; Eldridge on Marine Policies, 2d Edition, p. 90. It is true, as was pointed out in Gulf Refining Co. v. Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co., supra, that in case of valued hull policies losses resulting in repairs are customarily paid in full, not because of agreement or estoppel but because partial losses to hull usually result in repairs without any valuation of the hull and the rule that the recovery shall be measured by repairs has been found more convenient in practice than one requiring determination of the sound value of the shi. See Lohre v. Aitchison, L.R. 2 Q.B.D. 501, 507. The same rule as in the case of cargo insurance has been applied when repairs were not made and value was established by the sale of the vessel, Pitman v. Universal Marine Insurance Co., L.R. 9 Q.B.D. 192, and in the case of general average contribution by the hull. S. S. Balmoral Co. v. Marten, ( 1902) App.Cas. 511, 514, 515. The peculiar rule of the insurer's liability for partial loss to hull when repairs are made does not depend on the valuation clause and affords \n\n[304 \nU.S. 430, 436]\n\u00a0\n no basis for treating it as excluding the insured as co-insurer when there is a total loss.\n These variations in the effect of the valuation clause, in fixing the liability of the insurer, do not alter the character of the valued policy as a contract of indemnity, or afford any basis for alteration of his rights as an indemnitor. Whether upon a valued or an open policy, he is entitled to share in the insured's recovery of damages only by way of subrogation, whose sole object and justification is to make indemnity to the insured up to the amount of the policy, the measure of the liability of the insurer. Standard Marine Insurance Co. v. Scottish Metropolitan Assurance Co., \n283 \nU.S. 284, 288\n, 51 S.Ct. 371, 372; Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Phoenix National Bank & Trust Co., \n285 \nU.S. 209, 214\n, 52 S.Ct. 329, 331; Chapman v. Hoage, \n296 \nU.S. 526, 531\n, 56 S.Ct. 333, 335. The doctrine now contended for, would require a radical departure from the principle on which subrogation is founded. Consistently applied, it would in some cases deprive the insured of indemnity, and indeed might enable the insurer to make a profit by recovering more from the insured than the amounts paid on the policy. We are unable to sanction a doctrine involving such consequences.\n No question is raised by the petition for certiorari or appears to have been raised below as to the correctness of the adjustment statement, if the valuation clause does not foreclose proof of actual value and if respondent is therefore to be regarded as a co-insurer of the hull in event of total loss. Petitioners make no contention that respondent, if so regarded, has received more than appropriate indemnity after the distribution of the proceeds of the collision suit. The total insurance received by respondent from the insurers in 1918 and 1919, aggregating $ 886,068, was approximately $863,932 less than the prime value of the vessel which some thirteen years later it recovered in the collision suit, without allowance of interest and after the expenditure of more than $300, 000 as \n\n[304 \nU.S. 430, 437]\n\u00a0\n costs of the litigation. Petitioners submit no interest computations and have otherwise made no effort to sustain the burden of proving that respondent has received more than indemnity for the delay in payment of as much of the loss as was not covered by insurance.\n Since the expenses have been apportioned by charging the insured with a proportion greater than its share of the risk, and the apportionment is not assailed except as it may be wholly precluded by the valuation clause, it is unnecessary to consider whether the distribution of expense should be upon principles of co-insurance or whether the insured should be fully indemnified for it before the insurer is entitled to subrogation.\n Petitioners point to no practice of underwriters with respect to the valued policy or its rate of premium as compared with that for the open policy, which supports the rule for which they contend. But they insist that it has been adopted in England and has become so well settled in New York where the insurance was effected, that it must be taken to be an implied term of the policies. It is true that North of England, etc., Insurance Ass'n v. Armstrong, supra, lends support to petitioners' argument. There, upon a total loss, the insured had recovered as collision damages an amount less than the agreed valuation and it was held that the insurer, who had paid the policy in full, was nt itled to have the benefit of the entire recovery. The court thought that the case was analogous to that of abandonment in case of a constructive total loss where the underwriter, by virtue of the abandonment, is entitled to the wreck and to such profit from it as he can make. Pursuing the logic of its reasoning, the court declared that the insurer would have been entitled to the insured's full recovery even if it exceeded the agreed value. But it seems plain that there is no analogy between the insurer's right to be subrogated to the fruits of the insured's recovery from a wrongdoer \n\n[304 \nU.S. 430, 438]\n\u00a0\n and the insurer's right to a wreck which is his by abandonment. The Potomac, \n105 \nU.S. 630\n, 634; The St. Johns, 101 F. 469, 472 D.C., S.D.N.Y.; Arnould on Marine Insurance, 11th Edition,  1228-1230.\n North of England, etc., Insurance Ass'n v. Armstrong, supra, was cited in The Potomac, supra, page 635, and in Mobile & Montgomery R. Co. v. Jurey, \n111 \nU.S. 584, 594\n, 595 S., 4 S.Ct. 566, neither of which involved the question now presented. It was followed in The St. Johns, but not to the extent of allowing a profit to the insurer. In The Livingstone, 2 Cir., 130 F. 746, the claim of a valued hull insurer to the whole collision recovery, which exceeded the agreed value, was denied upon reasoning which rejected that of North of England, etc., Insurance Ass'n v. Armstrong, supra, and The St. Johns, supra, and calls for affirmance of the judgment here. Interest was allowed to the insurer, apparently because interest on the full value of the vessel had been recovered in the damage suit. Without discussing the point the court by its mandate directed payment to the underwriters of the full amount of their policies without deduction for expenses. But as it considered that the insurer's right of recovery rested upon subrogation unaffected by the valuation clause, we cannot regard the case as an intentional departure from the rule that the insurer is entitled to subrogation only after the insured is appropriately indemnified or as establishing any rule that the valuation clause forecloses proof of actual value as a step in measuring the insurer's recovery by way of subrogation.\n We recognize that established doctrines of English maritime law are to be accorded respect here, Queen Insurance Co. v. Globe & Rutgers Fire Insurance Co., supra, page 493, 44 S.Ct. page 176; Gulf Refining Co. v. Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co., supra, page 715, 49 S.Ct. page 441, but the pronouncement in North of England Insurance, etc., Ass'n v. Armstrong, supra, has never been adopted by \n\n[304 \nU.S. 430, 439]\n\u00a0\n an English appellate court. It was doubted by eminent judges in Burnand v. Rodocanachi, (1882) L.R. 7 App.Cas. 333, 342, and in Thames & Mersey Marine Ins. Co. v. British & Chilean S.S. Co., L.R. 2 K.B. 214, 221. Its reasoning, conflicting as it does with established principles of maritime insurance law, and found to be incapable of consistent application both in The St. Johns, supra, page 474, 475, and in The Livingstone, supra, page 750, should be rejected here.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALABAMA POWER CO. v.

The bills of complaint sought to enjoin the execution of these agreements. Each agreement contemplates the construction of an electricity-distribution system by the designated municipality, and, to that end, the purchase, by the Administrator, of bonds to be issued by the municipality and secured by a first pledge of the revenues derived from the operation of the system. In No. 84 30 and in No. 85 45 per cent. of the cost of the labor and materials used in the construction are to be donated outright. The authority relied upon for the loans and grants is that contained in Title 2 of the National Industrial Recovery Act1 as modified and continued by the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935.2 Title 1 of the former act has been declared unconstitutional by this court. 15 U.S.C.A.  701 et seq.

But we are here concerned not with Title 1 \n\n[302 \nU.S. 464, 474]\n\u00a0\n but with Titel 2 of the act. So far as material, that title provides:\n'(Sec. 202) The Administrator, under the direction of the President, shall prepare a comprehensive program of public works, which shall include among other things the following: (a) Construction, repair, and improvement of public highways and park ways, public buildings, and any publicly owned instrumentalities and facilities; (b) conservation and development of natural resources, including control, utilization, and purification of waters, prevention of soil or coastal erosion, development of water power, transmission of electrical energy; ... (c) any projects of the character heretofore constructed or carried on either directly by public authority or with public aid to serve the interests of the general public; (d) construction, reconstruction, alteration, or repair under public regulation or control of low-cost housing and slum-clearance projects; (e) any project (other than those included in the foregoing classes) of any character heretofore eligible for loans under subsection ( a) of section 201 of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act of 1932, as amended, (section 605b of Title 15) ...\n\n'(Sec. 203) (a) With a view to increasing employment quickly (while reasonably securing any loans made by the United States) the President is authorized and empowered, through the Administrator or through such other agencies as he may designate or create, (1) to construct, finance, or aid in the construction or financing of any public-works project included in the program prepared pursuant to section 202 (section 402); (2) upon such terms as the President shall prescribe, to make grants to States, municipalities, or other public bodies for the construction, repair, or improvement of any such project, but no such grant shall be in excess of 30 (by later act 45) per centum of the cost of the labor and materials employed upon such project.' (40 U.S.C.A.  402, 403(a). \n\n[302 \nU.S. 464, 475]\n\u00a0\n The bills of complaint challenge the validity of the loans and grants on the grounds, among others, that these statutory provisions purporting to authorize such loans and grants are unconstitutional; and that, in any event, the loans and grants do not come within the statutory provisions.\n\n The injury which petitioner will suffer, it is contended, as the loss of its business as a result of the use of the loans and grants by the municipalities in setting up and maintaining rival and competing plants; a result, it is further contended, which will be directly caused by the unlawful act of the administrator in making and consummating the loan-and- grant agreements.\n The suits were brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. There, the respondents, in addition to defending the validity of the action of the administrator, contended that petitioner was without legal standing to maintain the suits. After a full hearing, the District Court held that petitioner had standing to challenge the administrator's action, but denied the injunctions and dismissed the bills of complaint upon the view that the statutory provisions were constitutional and that they conferred upon the administrator the power which he had exercised.\n On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, that court found it unnecessary to consider the validity of the loans and grants, and affirmed the decrees of the District Court dismissing the bills on the ground that no legal or equitable right of the power company had been invaded, and the company, therefore, was without standing to challenge the validity of the administrator's acts. 91 F.2d 303. With that view we agree, and confine our consideration of the cases accordingly.\n The trial court made elaborate findings, but for present purposes the following is all that need be stated. Peti- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 464, 476]\n\u00a0\n tioner is a corporation organized under the laws of Alabama, having its principal office and corporate domicile in that state. Respondent Ickes is the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works, duly appointed by the President of the United States in pursuance of law. The other respondents are subordinate officers and agents of the same Emergency Administration, or officers connected with its operations.\n Petitioner, under its charter, has the right to manufacture, supply, and sell electrical energy throughout the state of Alabama. Among other communities served by its system are the four municipalities here involved, from each of which it has a nonexclusive franchise giving it the right to construct, maintain, and operate within the municipality an electricity- distribution system. Petitioner is a taxpayer of each of the municipalities, of the counties in which they are located, and of the state, with respect to petitioner's properties and operations; and it also is a taxpayer of the United States with respect thereto.\n Each of the municipalities is authorized under state law to construct and operate municipal electric plants and distribution systems, and to engage in competition with petitioner. Each is authorized to issue bonds for the purpose of financing the construction of such plants and to receive grants for that purpose; to mortgage its plant or any part of it; and to pledge all or any part of the revenues derived from the operation of the plant as security for the loan. \n3\n In each municipality an election was held prior to the making of the loan agreements, at which it was determined by a majority of the qualified voters that the municipality should engage in the electric business. The District Court further found-\n'Each of the municipalities involved in this suit determined to enter into the electric distribution business of \n\n[302 \nU.S. 464, 477]\n\u00a0\n its own free will. There was no solicitation or coercion on the part of any of the defendants (respondents), their agents or subordinates. There was and is no conspiracy between any of the defendants and any other person, nor is there any other effort on the part of any of the defendants to, nor are their actions motivated by a desire to, cause injury or financial loss to the plaintiffs, or to regulate their rates or electric rates generally, or to foster municipal ownership of utilities.\n\n'The expenditures under these statutes involve no purchase of, nor contract providing for, regulation by the United States. The failure of any city to apply for or receive loans or grants under those statutes will impose upon it no disadvantage or financial loss.\n\n'The defendants have not reserved any right or power to influence or control rates to be charged by the proposed municipal power plants. ...\n\n'Neither the United States nor any of the defendants has reserved any right or power under the existing contracts, or in any other way, to require any of the municipalities to eliminate competition or to designate the person or agency from whom the municipality must purchase its power . ...\n\n'Neither the United States nor any of the defendants has any power to control the operation of the projects after construction is completed. ...\n\n'Each of the projects herein involved is a part of a program of national scope, is designed to relieve unemployment, and promotes the general welfare of the United States.'\n\n These findings were made, after hearing, by the district judge upon undisputed or conflicting evidence. The findings were not questioned by the court below; and since they are not without substantial support in the evidence, we accept them here as unassailable. Davis v. Schwartz, \n155 \nU.S. 631, 636\n, 637 S., 15 S.Ct. 237; Adamson v. Gilliland, \n242 \nU.S. 350, 353\n, 37 S.Ct. 169. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 464, 478]\n\u00a0\n It, therefore, appears that each of the municipalities in question has authority to construct and operate its proposed plant and distribution system in competition with petitioner, and to borrow money, issue bonds, and receive grants for that purpose; that it determined to do so of its own free will, without solicitation or coercion; that there was no conspiracy between any of the respondents and any other person, or any effort or action motivated by a desire to cause injury or financial loss to petitioner, or any purpose to regulate rates or foster municipal ownership of utilities. It further appears that neither the United States nor any of the respondents has reserved any right or power to require an elimination of competition or designate any agency from which the municipality must purchase its power. Each municipality is left entirely free from federal control or direction in respect of the management and control of its plant and business. In short, the case for petitioner comes down to the contention that consummation of the loan-and-grant agreements should be enjoined on the sole and detached ground that the administrator lacks constitutional and statutory authority to make them, and that the resulting moneys, which the municipalities have clear authority to take, will be used by the municipalities in lawful, albeit destructive competition with petitioner.\n First. Unless a different conclusion is required from the mere fact that petitioner will sustain financial loss by reason of the lawful competition which will result from the use by the municipalities of the proposed loans and grants, it is clear that petitioner has no such interest and will sustain no such legal injury as enables it to maintain the present suits. Petitioner alleges that it is a taxpayer; but the interest of a taxpayer in the moneys of the federal treasury furnishes no basis for an appeal to the preventive powers of a court of equity. Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447\n, 486, et seq., 43 S.Ct. 597, 601. The principle estab- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 464, 479]\n\u00a0\n lished by the case just cited is that the courts have no power to consider in isolation and annul an act of Congress on the ground that it is unconstitutional; but may consider that question 'only when the justification for some direct injury suffered or threatened. presenting a justiciable issue, is made to rest upon such an act.' The term 'direct injury' is there used in its legal sense, as meaning a wrong which directly results in the violation of a legal right. 'An injury, legally speaking, consists of a wrong done to a person, or, in other words, a violation of his right. It is an ancient maxim, that a damage to one, without an injury in this sense (damnum absque injuria), does not lay the foundation of an action; because, if the act complained of does not violate any of his legal rights, it is obvious, that he has no cause to complain. ... Want of right and want of remedy are justly said to be reciprocal. Where therefore there has been a violation of a right, the person injured is entitled to an action.' Parker v. Griswold, 17 Conn. 288, 302, 303, 42 Am.Dec. 739. The converse is equally true, that where, although there is damage, there is no violation of a right no action can be maintained.\n Second. The only pertinent inquiry, then, is, What enforceable legal right of petitioner do the alleged wrongful agreements invade or threaten? If conspiracy or fraud or malice or coercion were involved, a different case would be presented, but in their absence, plainly enough, the mere consummation of the loans and grants will not constitute an actionable wrong. Nor will the subsequent application by the municipalities of the moneys derived therefrom give rise to an actionable wrong, since such application, being lawful, will invade no legal right of petitioner. The claim that petitioner will be injured, perhaps ruined, by the competition of the municipalities brought about by the use of the moneys, therefore, presents a clear case of damnum absque injuria. Stated in \n\n[302 \nU.S. 464, 480]\n\u00a0\n other words, these municipalities have the right under state law to engage in the business in competition with petitioner, since it has been given no exclusive franchise. If its business be curtailed or destroyed by the operations of the municipalities, it will be by lawful competition from which no legal wrong results.\n What petitioner anticipates, we emphasize, is damage to something it does not possess-namely, a right to be immune from lawful municipal competition. No other claim of right is involved. It is, in principle, as though an unauthorized loan were about to be made to enable the borrower to purchase a piece of property in respect of which he had a right, equally with a prospective complainant, to become the buyer. While the loan might frustrate complainant's hopes of a profitable investment, it would not violate any legal right; and he would have no standing to ask the aid of a court to stop the loan. What difference, in real substance, is there between the case supposed and the one in hand?\n The ultimate question which, therefore, emerges is one of great breadth. Can any one who will suffer injurious consequences from the lawful use of money about to be unlawfully loaned maintain a suit to enjoin the loan? An affirmative answer would produce novel and startling results. And that question suggests another: Should the loan be consummated, may such a one sue for damages? If so, upon what ground may he sue either the person making the loan or the person receiving it? Considered apart, the lender owes the sufferer no enforceable duty to refrain from making the unauthorized loan; and the borrower owes him no obligation to refrain from using the proceeds in any lawful way the borrower may choose. If such a suit can be maintained, similar suits by innumerable persons are likewise admissible to determine whether money is being loaned without lawful authority for uses, which, although hurtful to the complainants, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 464, 481]\n\u00a0\n are perfectly lawful. The supposition opens a vista of litigation hitherto unrevealed.\n John Doe, let us suppose, is engaged in operating a grocery store. Richard Roe, desiring to open a rival and competing establishment, seeks a loan from a manufacturing concern which, under its charter, is without authority to make the loan. The loan, if made, will be ultra vires. The state or a stockholder of the corporation, perhaps a creditor in some circumstances, may, upon that ground, enjoin the loan. But may it be enjoined at the suit of John Doe, a stranger to the corporation, because the lawful use of th money will prove injurious to him and this result is foreseen and expected both by the lender and the borrower, Richard Roe? Certainly not, unless we are prepared to lay down the general rule that A, who will suffer damage from the lawful act of B, and who plainly will have no case against B, may nevertheless invoke judicial aid to restrain a third party, acting without authority, from furnishing means which will enable B to do what the law permits him to do. Such a rule would be opposed to sound reason, as we have already tried to show, and cannot be accepted.\n If there are conditions under which two distinct transactions, neither of which, apart, constitutes a judicially remediable wrong, may be so related to one another as to afford a basis for judicial relief, such conditions are not to be found in the circumstances of the present case.\n What we have now said finds ample support in the decided cases. Among the decisions of this court, and directly in point, is New Orleans, M. & T. Railroad Co. v. Ellerman, \n105 \nU.S. 166\n. In that case, the railroad company was authorized by its charter, among other things, to obtain and afterwards manage, use, and enjoy wharves and the appurtenances thereto 'in connection with its railroads.' A Louisiana statute, Act No. 28 of 1868, conferred upon the railroad the power to obtain and thereafter to own, maintain, and use, suitable wharves, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 464, 482]\n\u00a0\n etc., 'connected with and incidental to said railroad.' Pursuant to this authority, the railroad company acquired property which it used as a wharf and which, although limited by the statute and its charter to use for railroad purposes, it leased to certain persons for the mooring of vessels and the loading and unloading of cargoes upon and from all vessels of a kind designated. Ellerman operated certain public wharves under a contract with the city of New Orleans giving him the right to collect revenues derived therefrom. He brought suit to enjoin the execution of the lease of the railroad wharf. This court held that he was without legal standing to maintain the suit-his only interest being to prevent competition with himself as a wharfinger, which the more extensive and challenged use by the lessees of the railroad wharf would create, and his claim for relief resting only upon the allegation that the use proposed by the lease was beyond the corporate power of the railroad company to grant. 'But if the competition in itself, however injurious,' we said, \n105 \nU.S. 166\n, at pages 173, 174, 'is not a wrong of which he could complain against a natural person, being the riparian proprietor, how does it become so merely because the author of it is a corporation acting ultra vires? The damage is attributable to the competition, and to that alone. But the competition is not illegal. It is not unlawful for any one to compete with the company, although the latter may not be authorized to engage in the same business. The legal interest which qualifies a complainant other than the State itself to sue in such a case is a pecuniary interest in preventing the defendant from doing an act where the injury alleged flows from its quality and character as a breach of some legal or equitable duty. A stockholder of the company has such an interest in restraining it within the limits of the enterprise for which it was formed, because that is to enforce his contract of membership. The State has a legal interest in prevent- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 464, 483]\n\u00a0\n ing the usurpation and perversion of its franchises, because it is a trustee of its powers for uses strictly public. In these questions the appellee has no interest, and he cannot raise them in order, under that cover, to create and protect a monopoly which the law does not give him. The only injury of which he can be heard in a judicial tribunal to complain is the invasion of some legal or equitable right. If he asserts that the competition of the railroad company damages him, the answer is, that it does not abridge or impair any such right. If he alleges that the railroad company is acting beyond the warrant of the law, the answer is, that a violation of its charter does not of itself injuriously affect any of his rights. The company is not shown to own him any duty which it has not performed.' Supporting cases are cited. See, also, United States v. Dern, 63 App.D.C. 28, 68 F.2d 773. Compare Edward Hines Trustees v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 143, 148\n, 44 S.Ct. 72, 73; Sprunt & Son v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 249, 256\n, 257 S., 50 S.Ct. 315, 318; Milwaukee Horse & Cow Comm. Co. v. Hill, 207 Wis. 420, 423, 430-432, 241 N. W. 364.\n The Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258\n, 44 S.Ct. 317, is not to the contrary. There, suit was brought by certain railroad companies to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission authorizing a competing company to acquire a terminal road. Answering the contention that complainants were without the legal interest necessary to entitle them to challenge the order, this court held that the right to sue arose in virtue of a special interest recognized by certain provisions contained in Transportation Act 1920, 41 Stat. 456, and under section 212 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(27) note, which gave any party to a proceeding before the commission the right to become a party to any suit wherein the validity of an order made in the proceeding is involved. In this view, the Ellerman Case was thought to be inapplicable. A reading of the case in connection with the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 464, 484]\n\u00a0\n dissenting opinion shows very clearly that, but for express statutory provision creating a different rule, the decision in the Ellerman Case would have been controlling.\n The precise question here involved was decided, in accordance with the view we have expressed, in Duke Power Co. v. Greenwood County, 4 Cir., 91 F.2d 665, 676; Greenwood County v. Duke Power Co., 4 Cir., 81 F.2d 986, 997. Compare Arkansas-Missouri Power Co. v. City of Kennett, Mo., 8 Cir., 78 F.2d 911. See, also, City of Allegan v. Consumers' Power Co., 6 Cir., 71 F.2d 477. The Greenwood County Case, supra, is now pending in this court upon certiorari, and will be determined upon the authority of our present decision.\n Frost v. Corporation Commission, \n278 \nU.S. 515\n, 49 S.Ct. 235, relied upon by petitioner, presents an altogether different situation. Appellant there owned a cotton-ginning business in the city of Durant, Okl ., for the operation of which he had a license from the Corporation Commission. The law of Oklahoma, Comp.Laws 1921,  3713 (17 Okl.St.Ann.  42), provided that no gin should be operated without a license from the commission, which could be obtained only upon specified conditions. We held that such a license was a franchise constituting a property right within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment; and that while the acquisition of the franchise did not preclude the state from making similar valid grants to others, it was exclusive against an attempt to operate a competing gin without a permit or under a void permit. The Durant Co-operative Gin Company sought to obtain a permit from the commission which, for reasons stated in our opinion, we held would be void and a clear invasion of Frost's property rights. We concluded that a legal right of Frost to be free from such competition would be invaded by one not having a valid franchise to compete, and sustained Frost's right to an injunction against the commission and the Durant company. See Corporation Commission v. Lowe, \n281 \nU.S. 431, 435\n, 50 S.Ct. 397, 398. The difference between the Frost Case and \n\n[302 \nU.S. 464, 485]\n\u00a0\n this is fundamental; for the competition contemplated there was unlawful while that of the municipalities contemplated here is entirely lawful.\n We deem it unnecessary to review the many other cases cited by petitioner where suits against officials have been sustained. An examination of them will disclose the presence of fraud, coercion, malice, conspiracy, or some other element or condition of controlling force-none of which, as shown by the findings which we have accepted as unassailable, exists in the present case.\n Decrees affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BLACK concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 90, 48 Stat. 195, 200, 40 U.S.C.A.  401 et seq. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Chapter 48, 49 Stat. 115, 119, 15 U.S.C.A.  728 note. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Oppenheim v.

The petition also challenges the respondent's ability to maintain a suit to enjoin the collection of the tax and to substitute as defendant the successor in office of the Collector originally impleaded. The court below decided all the ques- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 439, 442]\n\u00a0\n tions involved against the petitioner. \n1\n Because of their importance we granted certiorari. \n303 \nU.S. 634\n, 58 S.Ct. 831, 82 L.Ed. --.\n Section 500(a)(1) of the Revenue Act of 1926,2 as amended by section 711 of the Revenue Act of 19323 imposes 'a tax of 1 cent for each 10 cents or fraction thereof of the amount paid for admission to any place, ... to be paid by the person paying for such admission ....'4 Subsection (d) commands that the price (exclusive of the tax to be paid by the person paying for admission) at which every admission ticket is sold shall be conspicuously printed, stamped, or written on the face or back of that portion of the ticket which is to be taken up by the management and imposes a penalty for failure to comply with its terms. Section 502, 26 U. S.C.A.  955, 956, requires the person receiving payments for admissions to collect the tax and make return in such form as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may prescribe by regulation. Section 1102(a)5 imposes the duty on persons who collect the tax to keep records and render statements, under oath, and to make returns as required by the Secretary of the Treasury. Section 1114(b) and (d)6 fixes penalties for failure to collect or pay over and subsection (e), 26 U.S.C.A.  1610(a, b), provides for the personal liability of one collecting the admission charge \n\n[304 \nU.S. 439, 443]\n\u00a0\n and for distraint by the Collector of Internal Revenue for taxes and penalties. Section 607 of the Revenue Act of 19347 requires the person charged with the collection of the tax to hold the amount collected as a special fund in trust for the United States, confers the right to assess him with the amount so collected and withheld, including penalties, and, in connection with Rev.St.  3187,8 authorizes the Collector of Internal Revenue to distrain therefor.\n The respondent is a public corporation, created by Georgia as an instrumentality of the State, having control and management of the University of Georgia and the Georgia School of Technology. Athletics at these institutions are conducted under the respondent's authority by two corporations, the University of Georgia Athletic Association and the Georgia Tech. Athletic Association. The expense of physical education and athletic programs at each school is defrayed almost entirely from the admission charges to athletic contests and students' athletic fees collected for the purpose. During September and October, 1934, football games were played at the institutions, for which admissions were charged and collected by the associations. Each ticket showed on its face the admission price, the amount of the tax, and the total of the two, and also carried the following printed notice:\n'The University of Georgia (or Georgia School of Technology) being an instrumentality of the government of the State of Georgia, contends that it is not liable for any admission tax. The amount stated as a tax is so stated because the University is required to do so by Treasury regulations pending a decision as to its liability in this respect. This amount is collected by the University as a part of the admission and will be retained as such unless it is finally determined that the University is itself liable for the tax.' \n\n[304 \nU.S. 439, 444]\n\u00a0\n Each association deposited the total collected as the disputed tax in a separate bank account, apart from its other funds, but made no return thereof. The Collector prepared returns for the amounts. In consequence of the associations' neglect to pay the amounts so returned, the Commissioner assessed each association in the amount shown by return made for it and certified the assessments to the Collector who made demands for payment. These were ignored and the Collector filed liens, issued warrants, and levied upon the deposit accounts. The respondent then brought suit in which it prayed a decree that, as an agency of the State performing an essential governmental function in the conduct of the games, it was immune from the tax, and sought injunctions, temporary and permanent, to restrain the Collector from proceeding further to collect the sums demanded. From a decree awarding a final injunction the Collector appealed but, pending appeal, resigned and, before the hearing, died. Over objection the Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the petitioner substituted as appellant and affirmed the decree. We are of opinion that the court below rightly decided the procedural questions but erred as to the merits.\n\n First. If the suit was maintainable against his predecessor in office the substitution of petitioner was lawful. We are not unmindful of the principle that suits against officers to restrain action in excess of their authority or in violation of statutory or constitutional provisions are in thei n ature personal and that a successor in office is not privy to his predecessor in respect of the alleged wrongful conduct. \n9\n As a result of the inconvenience resulting from the lack of power to substitute one who succeeded to the office of an alleged offending official, to \n\n[304 \nU.S. 439, 445]\n\u00a0\n which this court has called attention, 10 Congress adopted the Act of February 13, 1925,11 which provides:\n'... Where, during the pendency of an action, suit, or other proceeding brought by or against an officer of the United States, ... and relating to the present or future discharge of his official duties, such officer dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold such office, it shall be competent for the court wherein the action, suit, or proceeding is pending, whether the court be one of first instance or an appellate tribunal, to permit the cause to be continued and maintained by or against the successor in office of such officer ....'\n\n The motion to substitute the petitioner asserted that, unless restrained, he would continue in the course pursued by his predecessor. The answer did not deny this allegation but relied upon the claim that the present Collector is not privy to the acts of the former one. In Ex parte La Prade, \n289 \nU.S. 444\n, 53 S.Ct. 682, this Court reserved the question whether in such a situation the successor might be substituted. As the present case is within the letter of the act and within the inconvenience intended to be obviated by its adoption, the substitution was properly permitted.\n Second. If the tax, the collection of which was threatened, constituted an inadmissible burden upon a governmental activity of the State, the circumstances disclosed render the cause one of equitable cognizance and take it out of the prohibition of Rev.St.  3224.12 The respondent has long been of opinion that exaction of the tax in respect of games played under the auspices of the University of Georgia and the Georgia School of Technology constitutes an unconstitutional burden upon an essential governmental activity of Georgia. At first \n\n[304 \nU.S. 439, 446]\n\u00a0\n the respondent collected the tax as required by the act, paid it over to the Treasury, and made claim for refund. The claim was rejected on the ground that the tax was paid by the patron of the game, and that the athletic associations and the respondent were mere collecting agents having no interest in the fund which would justify repayment to them if it had been illegally collected. Believing the basis of the Commissioner's refusal to refund was sound,13 the respondent then resorted to the expedient of collecting the amount of the tax under the reservation printed upon the tickets.\n The bill, after reciting the facts as above summarized, alleges that the statute imposes a tax upon the individuals who purchase tickets, but, properly construed, is inapplicable to those purchasing tickets to the football games in question. If further asserts that, in respect of those games, neither the respondent nor the athletic associations collected any tax from purchasers of admissions; that if the statute be construed to justify the Collector in seeking to force respondent to pay sums representng alleged taxes due from numerous individuals it is unconstitutional as an attempt to interfere with and control and to burden the State's educational activities and unlawfully to impose on the State government the duty of collecting taxes for the federal government; that the action of the petitioner in issuing warrants of distraint is either an attempt to collect from respondent taxes alleged to be due from various individuals, or to impose upon the respondent penalties, criminal and punitive in nature.\n The petitioner insists the bill shows the tax was in fact collected from the patrons of the games, and the allega- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 439, 447]\n\u00a0\n tion that no tax was collected is a mere conclusion of law which the court should ignore; that the trial court was without jurisdiction to determine in this suit for injunction whether or not taxes had been collected by respondent; that the Revenue Act imposes no liability for the tax upon the vendor of the tickets who fails to collect, although it does impose a penalty for wilful failure to collect the tax and other penalties; that, as the respondent collected the tax, it has no standing in its capacity as a collecting agent to deny the validity of the exaction, and, as a collecting agent, could not create a right to resist collection by the government by forcing a stipulation upon purchasers of tickets that the amount collected should belong to the agent if it were able to defeat the government; that, as such agent, respondent has no interest adverse to the United States; that the stipulation in question did not amount to an assignment of a ticket purchaser's claim for refund or, if it did, the purchaser has thereby lost his right to recover the tax by reason of the prohibition of assignment of claims against the United States embodied in Rev.St.  3477; 14 that respondent or the athletic associations would have had an adequate remedy at law for recovery of the amounts assessed against them had they paid the assessments; and finally that Rev.St.  322415 prohibits the issue of an injunction against collection.\n To these contentions respondent replies that while it placed the required information on the ticket and segregated the equivalent of the tax from the proceeds of tickets sold to avoid the imposition of penalties on its personnel, the notation on the tickets shows that it did not undertake to collect and did not in fact collect the tax; \n\n[304 \nU.S. 439, 448]\n\u00a0\n that, by refusal to collect, it took itself out of the category of an agent who voluntarily acted on behalf of the government; that while the statute places no liability upon respondent for the tax as such, it imposes upon the respondent civil and criminal penalties for refusal to collect it; that respondent is not an assignee of the claims of its patrons, but, if the tax is invalid, is owner in its own right of the entire amount paid by each purchaser; that respondent has no remedy at law because if it had paid the tax out of its own funds it could not have claimed refund of payment thus voluntarily made for its patrons' accounts; that State officials may not be required to collect an illegal tax as a condition precedent to contesting its validity; that section 3224 has no application to this suit.\n The dispute as to the propriety of a suit in equity must be resolved in the light of the nature of the controversy. The respondent in good faith believes that an unconstitutional burden is laid directly upon its transactions in the sale of licenses to witness athletic exhibitions conducted under authority of the State and for an essential governmental purpose. The State is entitled to have a determination of the question whether such burden is imposed by the statute as construed and applied. It is not bound to subject its public officers and their subordinates to pains and penaltes criminal and civil in order to have this question settled, if no part of the sum collected was a tax, and if the assessment was in truth the imposition of a penalty for failure to exact a tax on behalf of the United States. And if the respondent is right that the statute is invalid as applied to its exhibitions, it ought not to have to incur the expense and burden of collection, return, and prosecution of claim for refund of a tax upon others which the State may not lawfully be required to collect. These extraordinary circumstances we think justify resort to equity. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 439, 449]\n\u00a0\n What we have said indicates that Rev.St.  3224, supra, does not oust the jurisdiction. The statute is inapplicable in exceptional cases where there is no plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law. \n16\n This is such a case, for here the assessment is not of a tax payable by respondent but of a penalty for failure to collect it from another. The argument that no remedy need be afforded the respondent is bottomed on the assumption that it is a mere collecting agent which cannot be hurt by collecting and paying over the tax; but this argument assumes, first, that respondent did in truth collect a tax and, second, that the imposition of the tax on the purchase of admissions cannot burden a state activity. This is arguing in a circle, for these are the substantial matters in controversy. We hold that the bill states a case in equity as, upon the showing made, the respondent was unable by any other proceeding adequately to raise the issue of the unconstitutionality of the Government's effort to enforce payment.\n Third. We come then to the merits. For present purposes we assume the truth of the following propositions put forward by the respondent: That it is a public instrumentality of the State government carrying out a part of the State's program of public education; that public education is a governmental function; that the holding of athletic contests is an integral part of the program of public education conducted by Georgia; that the means by which the State carries out that program are for determination by the State authorities, and their determination is not subject to review by any branch of the federal Government; that a state activity does not cease to be governmental because it produces some income; that the tax is imposed directly on the State activity and \n\n[304 \nU.S. 439, 450]\n\u00a0\n directly burdens that activity; that the burden of collecting the tax is placed immediately on a State agency. The petitioner stoutly combats many of these propositions. We have no occasion to pass upon their validity since, even if all are accepted, we think the tax was lawfully imposed and the respondent was obligated to collect, return and pay it to the United States.\n The record discloses these undisputed facts: The stadium of the University of Georgia has a seating capacity of 30,000, cost $180,000, and was paid for by borrowed money which is being repaid by the Athletic Association, whose chief source of revenue is admissions to the contests in the stadium. $158,000 of the amount borrowed has been repaid since the stadium was completed in 1929. The student enrollment is about 2400. Each student pays an annual athletic fee of $10 which confers the privilege of free admission to all the school's athletic events. All admissions collected, and the tax paid on them, are paid by the general public, none by the students. \n17\n The total receipts of the Athletic Association from all sources for the year ending August 31, 1935, were $91,620.25, of which $71, 323.27 came from admissions to football games.\n The stadium of the Georgia School of Technology has a seating capacity of 29,000. It cost $275,000 and was paid for by a gift of $50,000 and from admissions charged and student fees. he enrollment is about 2, 000 students, each of whom pays an annual athletic fee of $7.50 which gives the privilege of free admission to all games. All admissions collected, and the tax paid on them, are paid by the general public, none by the students. \n17\n The total receipts of the Athletic Association for the six months ended December 31, 1934, were $119,436.75, of which $74,168.51 came from admissions to football games. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 439, 451]\n\u00a0\n It is evident that these exhibition enterprises are comparatively large and are the means of procuring substantial aid for the schools' programs of athletics and physical education. In final analysis the question we must decide is whether, by electing to support a governmental activity through the conduct of a business comparable in all essentials to those usually conducted by private owners, a state may withdraw the business from the field of federal taxation.\n When a state embarks in a business which would normally be taxable, the fact that in so doing it is exercising a governmental power does not render the activity immune from federal taxation. In South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437\n, 26 S.Ct. 110, 4 Ann.Cas. 737, it appeared that South Carolina had established dispensaries for the sale of liquor and prohibited sale by other than official dispensers. It was held that the United States could require the dispensers to take licenses and to pay license taxes under the internal revenue laws applicable to dealers in intoxicating liquors, and this notwithstanding the State had established the dispensary system in the valid exercise of her police power. In Ohio v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 360\n, 54 S.Ct. 725, it was shown that Ohio, in the exercise of the same power, had created a monopoly of the distribution and sale of intoxicating liquors through stores owned, managed, and controlled exclusively by the State. It was sought to enjoin the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and his subordinates from enforcing against the State, her officers, agents, and employes, penalties for the nonpayment of federal excises on the sale of liquor. Relief was denied and the views expressed in the South Carolina Case were reaffirmed. In Helvering v. Powers, \n293 \nU.S. 214\n, 55 S.Ct. 171, the court found that Massachusetts, in the exercise of the police power, had appointed a board of trustees to operate a street railway company's properties for a limited time. It was held that, though the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 439, 452]\n\u00a0\n trustees were State officers, their salaries were subject to federal income tax because the State could not withdraw sources of revenue from the federal taxing power by engaging in a business which went beyond usual governmental functions and to which, by reason of its nature, the federal taxing power would normally extend.\n The legislation considered in South Carolina v. United States, supra, provided for a division of the profits of the dispensary system between the State treasury and cities and counties. Thus the enterprise contributed directly to the sustenance of every governmental activity of the State. In the present instance, instead of covering the proceeds or profits of the exhibitions into the State treasury, the plan in actual operation appropriates these monies in ease of what the State deems its governmental obligation to support a system of public education. The difference in method is not significant. The important fact is that the State, in order to raise funds for public purposes, has embarked in a business having the incidents of similar enterprises usually prosecuted for private gain. If it be conceded that the education of its prospective citizens is an essential governmental function of Georgia, as necessary to the preservation of the State as is the maintenance of its executive, legislative, and judicial branches, it does not follow that if the State elects to provide the funds for any of these purposes by conducting a business, the application of the avails in aid of necessary governmental funti ons withdraws the business from the field of federal taxation.\n Under the test laid down in Helvering v. Gerhardt, \n304 \nU.S. 405\n, 58 S. Ct. 969, 82 L.Ed. --, decided this day, however essential a system of public education to the existence of the State, the conduct of exhibitions for admissions paid by the public is not such a function of state government as to be free from the burden of a nondiscriminatory tax laid on all admissions to public exhibitions for which an admission fee is charged. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 439, 453]\n\u00a0\n The opinion in South Carolina v. United States, supra, at pages 454- 457, 26 S.Ct. 110, points out the destruction of the federal power to tax which might result from a contrary decision. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n Moreover the immunity implied from the dual sovereignty recognized by the Constitution does not extend to business enterprises conducted by the States for gain. As was said in South Carolina v. United States, supra, at page 457, 26 S.Ct. at page 115: 'Looking, therefore, at the Constitution in the light of the conditions surrounding at the time of its adoption, it is obvious that the framers, in granting full power over license taxes to the national government, meant that that power should be complete; and never thought that the states, by extending their functions, could practically destroy it.' Compare Helvering v. Therrell, \n303 \nU.S. 218\n, 58 S. Ct. 539.\n The decree is reversed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n Mr. Justice BLACK concurs in the result.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, concurring in the result.\n Congress, by Rev.St.  3224, 26 U.S.C.A.  1543, has declared that 'No suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.' While \n\n[304 \nU.S. 439, 454]\n\u00a0\n I agree with the decision of the Court on the merits, I am not persuaded that this statute does not mean what it says, or that the suit is not one to restrain collection of the tax. I can only conclude, as I did in Miller v. Standard Nut Margarine Co., \n284 \nU.S. 498, 511\n, 52 S.Ct. 260, 264, that the statute deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to entertain respondent's suit, and that the judgment should be reversed with direction that the cause be dismissed.\n\n Mr. Justice REED concurs in the result.\n Except for the holding that injunction is a proper remedy to test the position of the Regents, I agree with the opinion of the Court. As even a small breach in the general scheme of taxation gives an opening for the disorganization of the whole plan, it seems desirable to express dissent from the conclusion that the Regents may utilize the summary remedy of injunction, over the objection of the Government, as a means of testing the applicability of a tax law to them.\n The facts set out in the opinion of the circumstances and agreement under which the money threatened to be distrained was collected make it quite clear, it seems to me, that the Regents collected tax moneys from the spectators. Any allegation in the petition to the contrary is an erroneous conclusion of law. The Collector sought to cover this money into the Treasury. Section 502(a) of the Revenue Act of 19261; section 607 of the Rev- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 439, 455]\n\u00a0\n enue Act of 19342 and section 3224 of the Revised Statutes3 make it clear that no injunction will lie to restrain such action. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Section 3224 was enacted in 1867 and until recent years was followed by the courts without deviation. Exceptions were made to protect taxpayers against collection of penalties. \n5\n In an exceptional case of 'special and extraordinary' circumstances,6 where a 'valid ... tax could by no legal possibility have been assessed against respondent ...' this Court permitted an injunction. 'Special and extraordinary' circumstances have multiplied. Here the lower court found them 'demonstrated by the fact that the Regents had actually paid the tax in former years, and filed a claim for refund which was denied on the ground that they had not \n\n[304 \nU.S. 439, 456]\n\u00a0\n borne the burden of any part thereof.' If may be assumed, and petitioner admits, that respondents may not pay the moneys and then sue to recover them. The fallacy underlying the opinion of the Court is the assumption that some remedy is necessary. Respondents, being merely collectors of tax moneys, are not entitled either to enjoin collection of these moneys or to pay and sue to recover them.\n There is no reason why the State of Georgia should risk or ask its agents to risk penalties to determine whether this tax is collectible. Respondents would lose nothing by collecting the tax and turning it over to the United States. If they desire to stand upon their own conception of the law and refuse to collect the tax, they must take the risks of such action. Every other taxpayer or collector of admission taxes must make the same choice.\n The prompt collection of revenue is essential to good government. Summary proceedings are a matter of right. \n7\n The Government has been seul ous to maintain a system of corrective justice. \n8\n Any departure from the principle of 'pay first and litigate later' threatens an essential safeguard to the orderly functioning of government. Here an injunction is approved when the petitioner below had little more legitimate interest in the collection of the tax than a curiosity to know whether the customers of its athletic spectacles, the real taxpayers, were constitutionally subject to such an exaction.\n I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice STONE concurs in this opinion. Mr. Justice BLACK concurs in this opinion except in so far as it approves the reasoning of the Court on the question of State immunity from interference by Federal taxation. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 439, 457]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n I am of opinion that the District Court had jurisdiction.\n So far as concerns the validity of the tax, the University is the State. It is an instrumentality carrying on the State's program of public education. The holding of the athletic contests in question is an integral part of that program and does not cease to be such because it produces income. The tax is imposed directly on and burdens that activity of the State. The Court assumes the facts above stated and decided the case on that basis. The tax is laid on the charge paid for admission, is to be borne by the person paying for admission and is to be collected by the State and handed over to the United States. It is hard to understand how the collection by the State of fees for the privilege of attendance brings, even for the purpose of federal taxation, its work of education to the level of selling intoxicating liquor (South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437\n, 26 S.Ct. 110, 4 Ann.Cas. 737; Ohio v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 360\n, 54 S.Ct. 725), operating a railway (Helvering v. Powers, \n293 \nU.S. 214\n, 55 S.Ct. 171), or conducting any other commercial activity. The tax seems plainly within the rule of state immunity from federal taxation as hitherto understood and applied. I would affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n304 \nU.S. 590\n, 58 S.Ct. 1053, 82 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The defendant in the District Court was W.

Files, of Shreveport, La., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant (defendant below) challenges Act No. 64 of 1934 of Louisiana on the ground that the Act 'if enforced \n\n[304 \nU.S. 197, 198]\n\u00a0\n ..., in the manner relied upon ..., would require ... (appellant) to pay to ... (appellee) the value of property which did not belong and never has belonged to ... (appellee), thereby leaving (appellant) responsible and liable to the true owner of such property for the value thereof, and in that manner depriving ... (appellant) of its property without due process of law, and denying to it the equal protection of the laws contrary to the provisions and requirements in the Constitution of the United States and of the State of Louisiana.'\n The act (the pertinent part of which is set out below)1 provides that a purchaser of oil can extinguish the indebtedness for the oil (as against all other parties) by paying the person who drilled and sold it under a lease from the last 'record owner,' if the recorded instrument \n\n[304 \nU.S. 197, 199]\n\u00a0\n of conveyance is sufficient to pass title in Louisiana, and in the absence of any suit filed to test the title of the land or oil or due notice by registered mail of the filing of such suit. Section 3 authorized purchasers to delay payment for purchases previously made until a lapse of 60 days after effective date of the act (August 1, 1934), and denied protection to purchasers who paid the 'last record' owner before the expiration of that period. The Louisiana Court of Appeal decided this 60- day period was in effect a short statute of limitations as against any possible owners not shown of record.\n The district court of Caddo parish rendered judgment for appellee. The Louisiana Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, sustained2 and the Supreme Court of Louisiana denied certiorari. The presiding judge of the Louisiana Court of Appeal granted an appeal to this Court under authority of 28 U.S. C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a).\n The record discloses that:\n May 24, 1927, Ackerman Oil Company, a corporation, by its president and secretary, executed a deed to A. C. Best and Sherman G. Spurr for the land in question, which was duly recorded as provided by Louisiana law. April 18, 1933, Best and Spurr executed an oil lease to Hyman Muslow ( appellee) under which the owners would receive one-eighth of the oil produced and Muslow seven-eighths. Thereafter, Muslow entered upon the leased land; equipped a well; contracted to sell oil to the Louisiana Oil Refining Corporation;3 laid a mile and a half pipe line to appellant's line and-between July, 1933, and September, 1934-delivered oil to appellant under the contract of sale. May 20, 1935, \n\n[304 \nU.S. 197, 200]\n\u00a0\n Muslow filed suit under the 1934 Act for mandamus to require payment for the oil. An alternative writ of mandamus was issued returnable May 28, 1935, on which date the company filed petition in bankruptcy under section 77B of the National Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  207. Appellant later answered and did not question that it owed someone $445 for the oil, but asserted that the conveyance to Best and Spurr was not translative of title to the oil due to inadequate consideration and lack of authority on the part of the corporate officers who signed the deed. Denial was made that Best and Spurr were the true owners of the land, on the same grounds. The courts of Louisiana decided these questions against appellant. Appellant also alleged that '... the said lands, having been forfeited to the State of Louisiana for non-payment of taxes on July 31, 1915, as appears from the forfeiture ... are the property of the State of Louisiana.' Concerning the statute under attack, the Court of Appeal of Louisiana has said:4\n'We experience little difficulty in determining the legislative intent in adopting this act. It supplied a long-felt need, and in its operative effect will serve to prevent imposition upon and unjust discrimination against those whom it was intended to protect. The act establishes a rule of conduct for the protection of lessors, and their assigns, under oil and gas leases, and also a rule of security and safety for lessees and those holding under or purchasing from them. ... The act was designed also to protect those persons whose rights arose from or are based upon contracts with the last record owner of the lands covered thereby, and to those who deal with or acquire from such persons.'\n\n Appellant contends that this law as applied would enable Muslow to recover the value of the oil delivered to \n\n[304 \nU.S. 197, 201]\n\u00a0\n appellant 'which ... (Muslow) did not own' and that appellant would also be left responsible to the true owner of the oil. The court below, La.App., 176 So. 686, 690, said that 'Over eight years had elapsed when this suit was filed and the company (transferor in the deed of record), the only person to complain, had not raised its voice in protest of its officers' action.' (Italics supplied.) Although nearly 11 years have elapsed since deed was made to Best and Spurr and almost 4 years since appellant purchased, received, and did not pay for the oil, the record does not disclose that there has been any other claimant or purported owner of the land nor does it show any effort by appellant to pay the money into court for the benefit of a 'true owner,' as it might under Louisiana law. \n5\n The only suggestion appellant has made as to any owner not of 'record' was that the property belonged to the State of Louisiana. That State-alleged by appellant to be the true owner of the land from which the oil was obtained-passed the 1934 Act and its courts have held that payment to Muslow will relieve appellant of the indebtedness. Appellant seeks to escape payment to Muslow for the oil which it purchased in 1934 on the ground that such payment would not discharge the indebtedness to a 'true owner'-alleged to be the State of Louisiana. The Louisiana Court of Appeals, 176 So. 686, 690, speaking in this case has declared that the statute 'protects the purchaser in paying the price to the one from whom the oil has been purchased; and, under the express declarations of the act, no recourse may thereafter be had by any third person or adverse claimant against such buyer.' Since no adverse claimant to the land has appeared in 11 years, it is clear under all the circumstances of this case that payment for the oil bought from \n\n[304 \nU.S. 197, 202]\n\u00a0\n Muslow in 1933 and 1934 will not deprive appellant of any rights under the Federal Constitution.\n'It is matter of common occurrence-indeed, it is almost the underviating rule of the courts, both state and Federal-not to decide constitutional questions (of the validity of a State Act) until the necessity for such decision arises in the record before the court.'

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC UTILITIES(1938)\nNo. 645\nArgued: March 31, 1938Decided: April 25, 1938\n\n\n\n Messrs. H. C. Walker, Jr., of Shreveport, La., and J. Merrick Moore, of Little Rock, Ark., for appellant.\n Messrs. Thomas Fitzhugh, of Little Rock, Ark., and John E. Benton, of Washington, D.C., for appellees. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 61, 62]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, a Delaware corporation, lawfully purchases and produces natural gas in Texas and Louisiana and thereafter transports and delivers it through pipe lines to selected industries and public utility distributing corporations-so-called 'pipe line customers'-at points in Arkansas. These deliveries are made under contracts entered into at Shreveport, La., and are effected by tapping a main pipe line or through connecting spurs. They amount annually to some eight billion cubic feet.\n Appellant, by admission, also maintains a distribution department, through which it acts as a public utility, for the local sale and distribution of gas in many Arkansas towns; but this organization is distinct from the one which supplies pipe line customers.\n The Arkansas Department of Public Utilities, proceeding under a local statute, Laws Ark.1935, No. 324, p. 895, in April, 1935, issued a general order (No. 13) requiring public utilities to file, upon specified forms, schedules of rates, charges, etc. Appellant presented such schedules for local utility service in the state, but declined to file copies of contracts, agreements, etc., for sales and deliveries to pipe line customers.\n Thereupon the Department issued an order to show cause for this failure. In response appellant 'set forth that the sale and delivery of gas from its Texas and Louisiana fields to its pipe line and industrial customers in Arkansas constitute interstate commerce, and that in making such sales and deliveries it was and is not acting as a public utility, and that accordingly the sale and delivery of said gas and the rates, schedules and charges upon which the same is delivered and sold were and are not subject to the jurisdiction of the Department and are \n\n[304 \nU.S. 61, 63]\n\u00a0\n beyond its power to regulate, and that Order No. 13 is not legally applicable to said business.'\n After a hearing upon the citation and response and much evidence, April 30, 1936, the Department ordered compliance with the general order. The matter then went for review to the circuit court, Pulaski county, and it held the challenged order invalid. Upon appeal the Supreme Court ruled that the sales and deliveries in question were not free from state regulation because parts of interstate commerce and directed compliance with the Department's general order.\n The question for present determination is whether this general order, valid under the laws of the state, which only compels appellant to file certain designated information, amounts to an infringement of any right or privilege guaranteed to it by the Federal Constitution. And to this a negative answer must be given.\n If, as claimed, certain of appellant's activities in Arkansas are parts of interstate commerce, that alone (and no other defense is relied upon) would not suffice to justify refusal to furnish the information presently demanded by the state.\n Appellant operates locally at many places in Arkansas and also delivers within the state great quantities of gas said to move without interruption from another state. In such circumstances it may be highly important for the state authorities to have information concerning all its operations. We are unable to see that merely to require comprehensive reports covering all of them would materially burden or unduly interfere with the free flow of commerce between the states.\n In case the Department undertakes by some future action to impose what may be deemed unreasonable restraint or burden upon appellant's interstate business through rate regulation or otherwise, that may be con- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 61, 64]\n\u00a0\n tested. The rule here often announced is that no constitutional question will be passed upon unless necessary for disposition of the pending cause.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court must be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause. \n\n\n\n","11":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nARMSTRONG PAINT & VARNISH WORKS v. NU-ENAMEL CORP.(1938)\nNo. 51\nArgued: Decided: December 5, 1938\n\n\n Corp. \n305 \nU.S. 315\n (1938) ]\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 317]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Moses Levitan, George I. Haight, and George A. Carpenter, all of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 318]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward S. Rogers, of Chicago, Ill., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 320]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Nu-Enamel Corporation of Illinois filed its bill of complaint in a District Court of the United States in Illinois to enjoin the Armstrong Paint and Varnish Works, a corporation of the same state, from using in the sale of paints, varnishes and similar goods the words 'Nu-Beauty Enamel' or any name including the words 'Nu-Enamel' or other colorable imitation of plaintiff's registered trade-mark Nu-Enamel or otherwise infringing it; to require an accounting of profits, and to recover treble damages. Pending the litigation, the plaintiff sold its assets to the other respondent Nu-Enamel Corporation of Delaware but continued its own corporate existence. The purchaser was permitted to intervene.\n The bill showed the registration by the plaintiff of Nu-Enamel under the Act of March 19, 1920, 15 U.S.C.A.  121 et seq., Trade-Mark 308,024, for mixed paints, varnishes, paint enamels, prepared shellacs, stains, lacquers, liquid cream furniture polishes and colors ground in oil. It set out that the name 'Nu-Enamel' through wide use by plaintiff had come to mean 'plaintiff and plaintiff's products only' and the 'word 'Nu-Enamel' is a mark by which the goods of the plaintiff are distinguished from other goods of the same class.' There were further allegations that defendant had adopted the name 'Nu-Beauty Enamel' with full knowledge of prior and extensive use by plaintiff of 'Nu-Enamel'; that as a result of defendant's use of the mark 'Nu-Beauty Enamel', merchants passed off defendant's products for plaintiff's, and that the products of both manufacturers were sold in interstate commerce. An exhibit showed that plaintiff used its mark with this slogan printed above it 'The coat of enduring beauty.'\n Defendant admitted 'that the name 'Nu-Enamel' has come to mean and is understood to mean, thoughout the United States, including the State of Illinois and the City \n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 321]\n\u00a0\n of Chicago, the plaintiff and plaintiff's products only, and the word 'Nu- Enamel' is a mark by which the goods of the plaintiff are distinguished from other goods of the same class'; denied the validity but not the fact or extent of the coverage of the registration; asserted 'Nu-Enamel' was a descriptive and generic term and that it had adopted 'Nu-Beauty' in connection with enamel and kindred products before it heard of the trade- mark or trade name 'Nu-Enamel.' Defendant answered specifically that it marketed only enamels under the designation 'Nu-Beauty Enamel' and that it did not market paints and varnishes under this name. The jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter was denied.\n The District Court made the following material findings of fact:\n'1. Plaintiff and defendant at the time of the filing of the bill of complaint herein were and are now both citizens of the State of Illinois. The intervener, Nu-Enamel Corporation, is a corporation of the State of Delaware.\n\n'2. 'Nu' in 'Nu-Enamel', appearing on plaintiff's label, is a phonetic spelling or misspelling of the English word 'new' and means 'new'.\n\n'3. 'Enamel' is a common English word describing a paint which flows out to a smooth coat when applied and which usually dries with a glossy appearance, and has long been known as such in the paint industry and to the public in general.\n\n'4. 'Nu-Enamel' used in connection with paint or enamel sold by plaintiff means 'new enamel' and is a common and generic term descriptive of the product to which it is applied and of its new or recent origin.\n\n'5. 'Nu' was commonly used in the paint and other industries in combination with other words as a misspelling or phonetic spelling of 'new' to designate brands and kinds of enamel, paint and other commodities before plaintiff and its prodecessors adopted the name 'Nu-Enamel.\" \n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 322]\n\u00a0\n It determined that 'Nu-Enamel' was not a valid trade-mark under the Trade-Mark Acts or at common law and, having so determined, refused jurisdiction of unfair competition.\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. \n1\n That court held the trade- mark nondescriptive, valid and infringed. It was of the opinion that the mark had acquired a secondary meaning. It found that the petitioner's conduct enabled merchants to palm off the Armstrong product for 'Nu- Enamel' and concluded that the District Court had jurisdiction of the issue of unfair competition. We granted certiorari on account of the importance in trade-mark law of the issues of the descriptive character of the mark and the effect of its acquired meaning under the Trade-Mark Act of 1920, 15 U.S.C.A.  121 et seq. \n305 \nU.S. 580\n, 59 S.Ct. 64, 83 L.Ed. --.\n As the petitioner concedes by answer that 'Nu-Enamel' has acquired the meaning of respondent and respondent's products only and is a mark which distinguishes respondent's goods from others of the same class, no evidence or finding is needed to establish that fact. It may be noted, also, that the allegation of the use of 'Nu-Beauty Enamel' by Armstrong on products other than enamels, fails of proof. Armstrong uses this mark on enamels only. On other products, there is the mark 'Nu-Beauty,' followed by some descriptive word, such as paint, varnish or brush.\n Federal Trade-Mark Act of 1920. The registration of 'Nu-Enamel' does not create any substantive rights in the registrant. \n2\n Trade-marks registered under the 1920\n\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 323]\n\u00a0\n act may be attacked collaterally. Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 2 Cir., 71 F.2d 662, 666.\n The act forbids the unauthorized use of the registered mark in foreign and interstate commerce and adopts the procedural provisions of the Trade-Mark Act of 1905.3 Through the inclusion of these procedural sections the lower Federal courts are given original and appellate jurisdiction of 'all suits at law or in equity respecting trade-marks registered in accordance with the provisions of this Act, arising under the present Act' and this Court was given jurisdiction for certiorari 'in the same manner as provided for patent cases.' 4 Section nineteen of the 1905 act, 15 U.S.C.A.  99, vesting power to grant injunctions in trade- mark cases is applicable also to proceedings under the 1920 act. By section twenty-three, 15 U.S.C.A.  103, former remedies in law and equity are left available. The significant distinction between the two acts is the omission in the 1920 act of the provision of section sixteen of the earlier act making the registration of a trade-mark prima facie evidence of ownership.\n On its face the act shows it was enacted to enable American and foreign users of trade-marks to register them in accordance with the provisions of the convention for the protection of trade-marks and commercial names, signed at Buenos Aires in 1910. In addition section one, paragraph (b), 15 U.S.C.A.  121(b), provides, without limitation to the export trade, for the registration of marks not registerable under section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of 1905, 15 U.S.C.A.  85, after one year's use in interstate or foreign commerce. This enables the (b) marks to be registered abroad. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 324]\n\u00a0\n While the Act of 1920 does not vest any new substantive rights, it does create remedies in the Federal courts for protecting the registrations and authorizes triple damages for infringement. \n5\n As a consequence of these remedial provisions, when a suit is begun for infringement, bottomed upon registration under the 1920 act, the district courts of the United States have jurisdiction. Unless plainly unsubstantial, the allegation of registration under the act is sufficient to give jurisdiction of the merits. In this case the trial court concluded that the invalidity of the trade-mark divested it of jurisdiction over unfair competition. This was erroneous. \n6\n Once properly obtained, jurisdiction of the one cause of action, the alleged infringement of the trade-mark, persists to deal with all grounds supporting it, including unfair competition \n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 325]\n\u00a0\n with the marked article. \n7\n The cause of action is the interference with the exclusive right to use the mark 'Nu-Enamel.' If it is a properly registered trade-mark, a ground to support the cause of action is violation of the Trade-Mark Act. If it is not a properly registered trade- mark, the ground is unfair competition at common law. The facts supporting a suit for infringement and one for unfair competition are substantially the same. They constitute and make plain the wrong complained of, the violation of the right to exclusive use.\n In the Oursler Case there was a valid copyright which was held not infringed. Here the trial court determined the trade-mark was invalid. The Oursler Case held that where the causes of action are different, the determination that the federal cause fails calls for dismissal. \n8\n But where there is only one cause of action we do not consider that the holding of the invalidity furnishes any basis for a distinction between this and the Oursler Case. Registration of 'Nu-Enamel' furnished a substantial ground for federal jurisdiction. That jurisdiction should be continued to determine, on substantially the same facts, the issue of unfair competition. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 326]\n\u00a0\n Registration of Descriptive Mark under 1920 Trade-Mark Act. Even though under the facts alleged and the admission that respondent's mark has acquired a secondary meaning the Federal courts have jurisdiction to determine whether petitioner is chargeable with unfair competition, it becomes necessary to determine whether registration of 'Nu-Enamel' is permissible or impermissible under the Act of 1920 in order that it may be known whether section four, the basis of the prayer in the bill for triple damages, is applicable. \n10\n Section one (b) of the 1920 act, 15 U.S.C.A.  121(b) permits registration of the marks used for one year in interstate commerce which were not registerable under the Act of 1905 'except those specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 5 (section 85 of this chapter)' of the Act of 1905, 15 U.S.C.A.  85(a, b). That section is set out below. \n11\n The point raised is whether the phrase- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 327]\n\u00a0\n 'except those specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 5 (section 85 of this chapter)' of the 1905 act is effective to bar not only marks, contra bonos mores, under (a) and marks, infra dignitatem, under (b) but also the following provisos, particularly the one concerned with descriptive words or devices.\n___ '(b) Consists of or comprises the flag or coat of arms or other insignia of the United States or any simulation thereof, or of any State or municipality or of any foreign nation, or of any design or picture that has been or may hereafter be adopted by any fraternal society as its emblem, or of any name, distinguishing mark, character, emblem, colors, flag, or banner adopted by any institution, organization, club, or society which was incorporated in any State in the United States prior to the date of the adoption and use by the applicant: Provided, That said name, distinguishing mark, character, emblem, colors, flag, or banner was adopted and publicly used by said institution, organization, club, or society prior to the date of adoption and use by the applicant: Provided, That trade-marks which are identical with a registered or known trade-mark owned and in use by another and appropriated to merchandise of the same descriptive properties, or which so nearly resemble a registered or known trade-mark owned and in use by another and appropriated to merchandise of the same descriptive properties as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers shall not be registered: Provided, That no mark which consists merely in the name of an individual, firm, corporation, or association not written, printed, impressed, or woven in some particular or distinctive manner, or in association with a portrait of the individual, or merely in words or devices which are descriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods, or merely a geographical name or term, shall be registered under the terms of this subdivision of this chapter: Provided further, That no portrait of a living individual may be registered as a trade-mark except by the consent of such individual, evidenced by an instrument in writing, nor may the portrait of any deceased President of the United States be registered during the life of his widow, if any, except by the consent of the widow evidenced in such manner: And provided further, That nothing herein shall prevent the registration of any mark used by the applicant or his predecessors, or by those from whom title to the mark is derived, in commerce with foreign nations or among the several States or with Indian tribes which was in actual and exclusive use as a trade-mark of the applicant, or his predecessors from whom he derived title for ten years next preceding February 20, 1905: Provided further, That nothing herein shall prevent the registration of a trade-mark otherwise registerable because of its being the name of the applicant or a portion thereof. And if any person or corporation shall have so registered a mark upon the ground of said use for ten years preceding February 20, 1905, as to certain articles or classes of articles to which said mark shall have been applied for said period, and shall have thereafter and subsequently extended his business so as to include other articles not manufactured by said applicant for ten years next preceding February 20, 1905, nothing herein shall prevent the registration of said trade-mark in the additional classes to which said new additional articles manufactured by said person or corporation shall apply, after said trade-mark has been used on said article in interstate or foreign commerce or with the Indian tribes for at least one year provided another person or corporation has not adopted and used previously to its adoption and use by the proposed registrant, and for more than one year such trade-mark or one so similar as to be likely to deceive in such additional class or classes.' U.S.C.A. Title 15,  85. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 328]\n\u00a0\n It seems clear that the mark 'Nu-Enamel' is descriptive of a type of paint long familiar to manufacturers,12 with the addition of the adjective new, phonetically spelled or misspelled. Obviously this slight variation from the orthographic normal is not unusual. Numerous \n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 329]\n\u00a0\n illustrations of such use by paint and varnish manufacturers are given by petitioner in its answer. The trade-mark is registered by the Nu-Enamel Corporation for a variety of products from enamels through paint brushes to glue, solder and tack rags. It is quite true that the mark is not descriptive as applied to many of respondent's products but the use by petitioner, the Armstrong Company, of which the Nu-Enamel Corporation complains is the use of 'Nu-Enamel' or 'Nu-Beauty Enamel.' This use, Armstrong answers and the evidence supports the assertion, is confined to the enamels. We must therefore consider the case as though the only products of Nu-Enamel Corporation were enamels. As applied to them it is descriptive.\n That the mark is descriptive of paint enamels does not bar it from registration as to them under the 1920 act. This has been the construction of the Patent Office. \n13\n To \n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 330]\n\u00a0\n construe (b) of the 1920 act to bar names, descriptive marks and merely geographical terms would make the subsection useless. The obvious purpose of its inclusion was to widen the eligibility of marks. A dictum has expressed14 a view contrary to that of the Patent Office.\n This administrative interpretation, contemporary with the legislation, and the legislative history have weight- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 331]\n\u00a0\n 'when choice is nicely balanced.' \n15\n We construe section 1(b) of the 1920 act to be applicable to the categories expressed in Section 5 of the Act of 1905 under (a) and (b) including the first proviso but not to include the other provisos of (b). This conclusion is fortified by the addition \n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 332]\n\u00a0\n of the proviso to section one (b) of the 1920 act, relating to identical trade-marks. The proviso in section 5(b) of the 1905 act refusing registration to identical marks in much the same language was construed in Thaddeus Davids Co. v. Davids Mfg. Co., \n233 \nU.S. 461\n, 34 S.Ct. 648, Ann.Cas.1915B, 322, as not permitting the registration of such marks when used for ten years under the fourth, now fifth, proviso of that section. We think that Congress in adopting the corresponding proviso in subsection (b) of the 1920 act, must be taken to have adopted the accepted construction of the similar proviso of the 1905 act. If the language of the 1920 act had been intended to exclude from registration all the classes excluded by the provisos of section five of the 1905 act, it would have been unnecessary to include this proviso.16\n This Court has had several occasions within the last few years to construe statutes in which conflicts between \n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 333]\n\u00a0\n reasonable intention and literal meaning occurred. We have refused to nullify statutes, however hard or unexpected the particular effect, where unambiguous language called for a logical and sensible result. \n17\n Any other course would be properly condemned as judicial legislation. However, to construe statutes so as to avoid results glaringly absurd, has long been a judicial function. \n18\n Where, as here, the language is susceptible of a construction which preserves the usefulness of the section, the judicial duty rests upon this Court to give expression to the intendment of the law.\n Remedies. \n19\n Registration under the 1920 act conferred no substantive rights in the registered mark but it does permit suits in the Federal courts to protect rights otherwise acquired in the marks. The 1905 act, section one, 15 U.S.C.A.  81, authorizes the 'owner' to obtain registration of eligible trade-marks; section two, 15 U.S.C.A.  82, require the applicant to make oath that he 'believes himself ... to be the owner of the trade-mark'; section five, 15 U.S.C.A.  85 refers to the 'owner of the mark'; section sixteen, 15 U.S.C.A.  96, then declares that 'the registration of a trade-mark under the provisions of this Act ( subdivision of this chapter) shall be prima facie evidence of ownership'; section 23, 15 U.S.C.A.  103, reserves all remedies at law or in equity which any party aggrieved by the wrongful use of his trade-mark would have had without the Act of 1905.\n The 1920 act omits the quoted portion of section sixteen as to the effect of registration as prima facie evidence of ownership. Under section one, 15 U.S.C.A.  121, the register includes all marks communicated to the Commissioner of Patents by the international bureaus provided for by the Buenos Aires convention of 1910 \n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 334]\n\u00a0\n and all other marks not registerable under the Trade-Mark Act of 1905, with the exceptions discussed in the preceding section of this opinion, in bona fide use by the proprietor thereof for one year in commerce other than intrastate. Section four,20 which protects the trade-mark, is substantially the same as section sixteen of the 1905 act, except for the omission of the prima facie presumption of ownership. It is the owner who has the rights of action under this act, unaided by any presumption from registration. The owner, on the other hand, is not limited in any way by the Act, as section 23 of the Act of 1905 is made specifically applicable. This section preserves the legal and equitable remedies to an aggrieved owner. The Committee on Patents in the Senate was quite positive that the effect of the act on domestic rights was nil. \n21\n The registrant acquires by the acceptance of his mark under the 1920 act the right to proceed in the Federal courts against infringers and to recover triple damages if he can establish his ownership of the trade-mark at common law.\n'Nu-Enamel' is descriptive of the enamels in issue. The use on the numerous other articles of respondent's manufacture, in its advertising, on store window valances, on electric and other displays, and as the name of many stores and the sign of several thousand dealers, justify petitioner's concession that the name means respondent and respondent's products only and the word distinguishes \n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 335]\n\u00a0\n its goods from others of the same class. But a mark which is descriptive is not a good trade-mark at common law.22\n\n It was said in Thaddeus Davids Co. v. Davids Mfg. Co.,23 that names registered under the last proviso of section 5 of the 1905 act, 15 U.S.C.A .  85, became technical trade-marks upon valid registration under that act. Assuming that descriptive terms in this respect would be analagous to proper names, there are clear distinctions between the acts. The 1920 act does not define 'trade-mark' to include any mark registered under its terms, as does section 29 of the 1905 act, 15 U.S.C.A.  108. Remedies are afforded registrants under the 1920 act but these remedies are for 'owners,' and actual and exclusive use, short of a secondary meaning,24 does not qualify a registrant under the 1920 act as an owner. That ownership must be established by proof. \n25\n Unless this ownership is established, no rights of action under the 1920 act for infringement exist. Here we have a secondary meaning to the descriptive term, 'Nu-Enamel.' This establishes, entirely apart from any trade-mark act, the common law right of the Nu- Enamel Corporation to be free from the competitive use of these words as a trade-mark or trade name. \n26\n As was pointed out in the Davids Co. Case, in considering the ten-year clause of the 1905 act, 15 U.S.C.A.  85, this right of freedom does not confer a monopoly on the use of the words. It is a mere protection against their unfair use as a trade-mark or trade name by a competitor seeking \n\n[305 \nU.S. 315, 336]\n\u00a0\n to palm off his products as those of the original user of the trade name. This right to protection from such use belongs to the user of a mark which has acquired a secondary meaning. He is, in this sense, the owner of the mark. We agree with the conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals that infringement is shown.\n The rights of Nu-Enamel Corporation to be free of the competitive use of 'Nu-Enamel' may be vindicated, also, through the challenge of unfair competition, as set out in the bill. The remedy for unfair competition is that given by the common law. The right arises not from the trade-mark acts but from the fact that 'Nu-Enamel' has come to indicate that the goods in connection with which it is used are the goods manufactured by the respondent. When a name is endowed with this quality, it becomes a mark, entitled to protection. The essence of the wrong from the violation of this right is the sale of the goods of one manufacturer for those of another. \n27\n\u00a0\n\n The questions as to damages, profits, and the form of the decree will be passed upon more appropriately by the trial court. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversing the decree of the District Court is affirmed and this cause is remanded to the District Court with directions to proceed in conformity with the opinion of this Court.\n It is so ordered.\n Affirmed and cause remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 7 Cir., 95 F.2d 448. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Kellogg Co. v.

When the Circuit Court of Appeals concluded the trade- mark was registerable as non-descriptive, it declared that the issue of unfair competition was cognizable in the trial court. It does not appear whether the reason for this holding was because the mark was registerable or because it had acquired a secondary meaning, through extensive use. The lower court does not consider whether the bill alleges registration under the 1920 Act. If the mark is not descriptive it is registerable under the 1905 Act. A mark registerable under the 1905 Act is not registerable under the 1920 Act. 16 Trade Mark Reporter, 93, 530. The language of the 1920 Act permits registration only of marks communicated by the international bureau and those not registerable under the 1905 Act. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] 'No mark by which the goods of the owner of the mark may be distinguished from other goods of the same class shall be refused registration as a trade-mark on account of the nature of such mark unless such mark- '(a) Consists of or comprises immoral or scandalous matter. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] 'Enamel or Varnish Paint.-These types of paints dry with a brilliant glossy surface. They are made by grinding the selected pigment, or mixture of pigments, in a varnish medium, and their nature and properties depend on the type of varnish used. A quick-drying variety is made by using a cheap rosin varnish as the vehicle, it dries with a high gloss surface in about 2-4 hours, but owing to the brittle and non-durable nature of the varnish used it is only suitable for interior use. High- class durable enamels, suitable for both inside and outside use, are made by using mixtures of heat-treated linseed oil (stand oil) and elastic copal varnishes as the vehicle. They are slow-drying, taking from 12-18 hours, and are very tough under the severest climatic conditions.\n'Flat Paint.-This type of paint is really a flat-drying enamel. It is made in much the same way as the high class glossy enamels, except that it contains less varnish and more turpentine than ordinary enamel. Some varieties contain a proportion of wax dissolved in the varnish so as to give a more perfect mat or flat finish. Owing to their pleasing decorative effect they are used for interior decorations, but are not suitable for outside use.' 17 Encyclopedia Britannica (14th Ed.) 35. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Wright Co. v.

In other words, my view is that register (b) provided by the recent act is not intended for any trade-mark registerable under any part of the act of February 20, 1905, nor for registration of any mark not registerable as specified in paragraphs or schedules (a) and ( b) of section 5 of that act. The doubt will be relieved and a rational construction of the law will be subserved by considering the reference in the recent act to 'paragraphs (a) and (b)' of section 5 of the amended act of February 20, 1905, as meaning schedules a and b rather than paragraphs strictly and as comprising the following matters specified as not registerable, viz.:\n\n\"(a) Consists of or comprises immoral or scandalous matter.\n\n\"(b) Consists of or comprises the flag or coat-of-arms or other insignia of the United States or any simulation thereof, or of any State or municipality or of any foreign nation, or of any design or picture that has been or may hereafter be adopted by any fraternal society as its emblem, or of any name, distinguishing mark, character, emblem, colors, flag, or banner adopted by any institution, organization, club, or society which was incorporated in any State in the United States prior to the date of the adoption and use by the applicant: Provided, That said name, distinguishing mark, character, emblem, colors, flag, or banner was adopted and publicly used by said institution, organization, club, or society prior to the date of adoption and use by the applicant.'\n\n\n'This was the evident intention, as shown by the congressional hearings on the recent act, and with such construction a field will exist for the operation of the new law; otherwise none would remain.'\n\n Rule 19 of the Rules of the Patent Office Governing Registration of Trade-marks, issued July 1, 1937, reads as follows:\n'A trade-mark must have been actually used in commerce before an application for its registration can be filed in the Patent Office.\n\n'No trade-mark will be registered ... under the act of February 20, 1905, which consists merely in the name of an individual, firm, corporation, or association, not written, printed, impressed, or woven in some particular or distinctive manner or in association with a portrait of the individual, or merely in words or devices which are descriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods, or merely a geographical name or term .... No trade-mark will be registered under section 1(b), act of March 19, 1920, which is registerable under the act of February 20, 1905, as amended, or which has not been in bona fide use as a trade-mark for one year in international or interstate commerce or commerce with Indian tribes.' \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] In re Chas.

Standard Oil Co., \n294 \nU.S. 87, 96\n, 55 S.Ct. 333, 337.\n On January 21 and 22, 1920, the Committee on Patents of the House of Representatives was considering H.R. 7157 of the 66th Congress, 2nd Session, a bill to amend section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of 1905. The Commissioner of Patents discussed with the Committee an amendment applicable to H.R. 9023 of the 66th Congress entitled 'A bill to give effect to certain provisions of the convention for the protection of trade- marks.' The applicable language is as follows:\n'Mr. Newton. Yes. The amendment we propose is this:\n\n\"All other marks not registerable under the act of February 20, 1905 ( as amended), but which for not less than two years have been bona fide used in interstate or foreign commerce, or commerce with Indian tribes, by the proprietor thereof, upon or in connection with any goods of such proprietor and upon which the fee of $10 has been paid and such formalities as are prescribed by the Commissioner of Patents have been complied with, may be registered.'\n\n'Anything may be registered. That is an amendment to the bill that was passed yesterday. That bill does not give prima facie validity to the mark that is registered, the bill that passed yesterday, and this amendment does not give it. That is the reason we put this proposed amendment into the bill. But Mr. Merritt's bill wants to give them prima facie evidence of ownership, so we put that under the 1905 statute where it naturally belongs.' Hearings on H.R. 7157 before the Committee on Patents, 66th Congress, 2d Session, p. 30.\n\n Later in the hearing on the bill which became the act of March 19, 1920, this discussion was continued by Mr. Whitehead, Assistant Commissioner of Patents, who discussed the Commissioner's suggested language quoted above and said:\n'One or two slight amendments ought, it seems to me, to be made to the bill. The bill as it stands is broad enough to put any mark on the register. Section 5 of the act of February 20, 1905, outlaws-if I may use that expression-two classes of marks-one, scandalous and immoral marks, and the other marks consisting of the flag or coat of arms of the United States, etc., and it seems as if this Senate amendment ought to be amended to exclude those marks specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of that section. Otherwise there can be put on the register scandalous marks and the flag of the United States. I think it must have been overlooked. I do not think Mr. Merritt or Mr. Newton thought that they were including those two types of marks. It seems as if that could be accomplished by inserting in the amendment, after the words 'all other marks not registerable under the act of February 20, 1905,' the words, 'except those specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 5 of that act,' or words to that effect.' \n\n After discussion of other matters:\n'The Chairman. If you will in your brief just make those suggestions, we will be glad to take them up with the conferees.\n\n'Mr. Whitehead. I will be glad to do that. I think the only really important one is to exclude those of paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 5. These others are minor matters.'

STATE TAX COMMISSION OF OREGON(1938)\nNo. 303\nArgued: January 13, 1938Decided: January 31, 1938\n\n\n\n Mr. Howard P. Arnest, of Portland, Or., for appellants.\n Mr. Carl E. Davidson, of Portland, Or., for appellees. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 20, 21]\n\u00a0\n\n PER CURIAM.\n This case presents the question of the validity of the personal income tax law of Oregon, Oregon Code 1930, c. 25, tit. 69,  69-1501 to 69-1538, as amended by Laws 1933, cc. 322, 387, and by Laws 1933, 2d Sp. Sess., c. 31, as applied to the net income of the appellants derived from their work within the exterior limits of the state in the construction of the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia river under a contract with the United States. The contract was made in February, 1934, and the work was completed in that year. The tax was assailed upon the grounds (1) that it burdened the operations of the Federal Government and (2) that the area within which the work was done was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. The Supreme Court of the state sustained the tax (156 Or. 461, 62 P.2d 13, 67 P.2d 161, 166) and the contractors appeal.\n With respect to the contention that the state law lays an unconstitutional burden upon the Federal Government, the case is controlled by our previous decisions. Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514\n, 46 S.Ct. 172; General Construction Co. v. Fisher, \n295 \nU.S. 715\n, 55 S.Ct. 646; James v. Dravo Contracting Co., \n302 \nU.S. 134\n, 58 S.Ct. 208; Silas Mason Company v. Tax Commission, \n302 \nU.S. 186\n, 58 S.Ct. 233, decided December 6, 1937. In the two cases last mentioned the tax which was upheld was upon the gross income of the contractors. In Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, supra, and General Construction Co. v. Fisher, supra, the tax was upon the net income.\n As to territorial jurisdiction, it appears that the area within the boundaries of Oregon in which the work was \n\n[303 \nU.S. 20, 22]\n\u00a0\n performed embraced (a) the bed of the Columbia river, where the main structural works are placed, and (b) Bradford island and a portion of the mainland.\n The United States did not acquire title to the bed of the river. Upon this point the state court said:\n'Section 60-1302, Oregon Code 1930 (Laws 1874, p. 10), grants to the Governor of Oregon authority and power to convey to the United States title to land belonging to the state and covered by the waters of the United States, not exceeding 10 acres in any one tract, as the site of a lighthouse, beacon, or other aid to navigation, upon application made to him by a duly authorized agent of the United States, and further grants him authority 'to cede to the said United States jurisdiction over the same,' reserving, however, to the state the right to serve thereon civil or criminal process issuing under authority of the state. No application has been made to the Governor of this state or to the Legislature for conveyance of any part of the bed of either the north or south channel of the Columbia river within the project, or for cession to the federal government of jurisdiction over the same. ...\n\n'No authority has been called to our attention to the effect that the state of Oregon has in any way relinquished its sovereignty over the area occupied by the waters of Bradford slough and that part of the north channel of the Columbia river which is within the territorial limits of the state.'\n\n The case in this relation falls within the principle of our decision in James v. Dravo Contracting Company supra. The question, we there said, was not one of the paramount authority of the Federal Government to have the work performed for purposes within the federal province. The title to the bed of the river was in the state. And, although subject to the dominant right of the Federal \n\n[303 \nU.S. 20, 23]\n\u00a0\n Government, the servient title continued in the state which thus retained its territorial jurisdiction for purposes not inconsistent with the exercise by the Federal Government of its constitutional functions. See, also, Silas Mason Company v. Tax Commission, supra.\n The remaining question concerns the lands on Bradford island and the mainland which were purchased by the United States. Appellants rely upon the Oregon statute giving consent to the United States to purchase or otherwise acquire any land within the state 'for the purpose of erecting thereon any needful public buildings' under authority of any act of Congress, and providing that the United States should have 'the right of exclusive jurisdiction over the same,' saving the authority of the state for the service of process. Oregon Code 1930,  60-1303.\n In Silas Mason Company v. Tax Commission, supra, we said that as a transfer of exclusive jurisdiction rests upon a grant by the state, it follows, in accordance with familiar principles applicable to grants, that the grant may be accepted or declined. Acceptance may be presumed in the absence of evidence of a contrary intent. But we found no constitutional principle 'which compels acceptance by the United States of an exclusive jurisdiction contrary to its own conception of its interests.' The mere fact that the Government needs title to property within the boundaries of a state 'does not necessitate the assumption by the Government of the burdens incident to an exclusive jurisdiction.'\n In this instance, the state court took the view that the Federal Government had not accepted and did not intend to exercise exclusive legislative authority over the lands which had been purchased for this project. The court said:\n'The mere fact that there may be on the statute books of the state a general law, such as section 60-1303, Oregon Code 1930, consenting to the purchase of land by the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 20, 24]\n\u00a0\n United States and granting to the national government the right to exercise exclusive jurisdiction thereover, does not imply that over all lands purchased by the national government in the state after the enactment of such law the state is divested ipso facto of sovereignty, and exclusive control over the acquired area is assumed by the federal government. In the instant case there is nothing to indicate that the federal government desires to exercise exclusive legislative jurisdiction over the land purchased by it within the Bonneville Project. It would be somewhat inconsistent to assume that, since it does not have such jurisdiction over the major part of the structures which are now being built, the federal government is seeking to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over that part of the works located on lands title to which it has acquired.\n\n'The record discloses that the government officials in charge of the construction work required the contractors to come under the provisions of the workmen's compensation law of the state (Code 1930,  49-1801 et seq. as amended) in which the work was to be performed. At the time the contract with the plaintiffs was entered into at least two states had held that their workmen's compensation laws were not effective on territory over which the federal government had exclusive jurisdiction: Willis v. Oscar Daniels Co., 200 Mich. (19) 30, 166 N.W. 496; Murray v. Joe Gerrick & Co., 172 Wash. 365, 20 P.2d 591. On February 5, 1934, the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the latter case. See \n291 \nU.S. 315\n, 54 S.Ct. 432, 92 A.L.R. 1259\n\n\n\n'The contract between the plaintiffs and the federal government was dated February 6, 1934. In view of those decisions, it is reasonable to assume that the officials in charge of construction of the Bonneville Dam on behalf of the federal government understood that the land included in the project was not under the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the United States. Otherwise they \n\n[303 \nU.S. 20, 25]\n\u00a0\n would not have required contractors to provide state workmen's compensation.'\n\n The contract between the Government and appellants is not in evidence but the record discloses, as stated by the state court, that the Government did not seek to exclude the state from all legislative authority, an exclusion which would have followed from an acceptance of a grant of 'exclusive jurisdiction' with the sole reservation of the right to serve process. The enforcement and administration of the Oregon Compensation Law, see Oregon Code 1930,  49-1801 to 49-1845, as amended, with which the contractors were required to comply, were incompatible with the existence of exclusive legislative authority in the United States. \n1\n If, however, exclusive jurisdiction, although offered, was not accepted by the United States, there is no warrant for the conclusion that the state did not retain its territorial jurisdiction over the area in question so far as its exercise involved no interference with the carrying out of the federal project. And as we have decided that there is no such interference through the enforcement of a tax such as is here assailed, we find no ground for overruling the decision of the state court.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The purchase of the lands, here involved, were made by the Government, and the contract with the appellants was made and performed, prior to the enactment of the Act of Congress of June 25, 1936, 49 Stat. 1938, 40 U.S.C.A.  290, and we express no opinion as to the effect of that act in relation to lands as to which exclusive jurisdiction had previously been granted to and accepted by the United States. \n\n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALTIMORE & O.R.

The court made findings of fact upon the evidence and dismissed the bill without opinion.\n The first challenged order, dated March 11, 1935, followed an earlier suspension of certain proposed schedules and an investigation. It cancelled these schedules and determined what thereafter would be maximum reasonable rates upon a mileage basis. Subsequently, the proceed- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 58, 60]\n\u00a0\n ings having been reopened, this order was modified and reaffirmed. In the circumstances we think the court below properly declined to pass upon its validity.\n The second challenged order, April 30, 1936, followed one entered April 15, 1936, which upon petition and replies reopened the proceedings for reconsideration on the record as it then stood. The later order affirmed former findings that the schedules suspended by the one of March 11, 1935, had not been justified, and prescribed future maximum rates upon a mileage basis. These were lower (some ten per cent) than those authorized prior to 1935\n\n\n Here counsel specially insist this second order exceeded the jurisdiction of the Commission since it undertook to determine rates concerning which there had been no proper notice or opportunity for hearing. But this contention rests upon an assumed construction of the order not obviously correct. The Commission has not so construed it nor has that body been asked so to do or for any further action in respect of it. Another construction brings the order clearly within the jurisdiction assumed by the Commission. In the circumstances appellants cannot prevail on this point.\n Appellants further urge that the order is contrary to the weight of the evidence, not supported by substantial evidence, disregards ordinary standards for determining reasonableness of rates, is not supported by necessary findings, and represents a mere attempt to equalize geographical and transportation disadvantages, fortune and opportunities. The findings by the court below we think are adequately supported by the record. They negative these claims and leave no sufficient basis for our interference with the action there taken.\n The challenged judgment must be\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause. \n\n\n\n","14":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBATES MFG. CO. v. U.S.(1938)\nNo. 647\nArgued: March 11, 1938Decided: March 28, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 567, 568]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles B. Rugg, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. Norman D. Keller, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Revenue Act of 19261 provides that 'No suit ... shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, ... unless such suit ... is begun within two years after the disallowance of ... such claim.'\n The Tucker Act of March 3, 1887,2 as amended, gives concurrent jurisdiction to the District Courts and the Court of Claims in suits against the United States including those for recovery of erroneous or illegally collected taxes. \n3\n Section 5 of the Tucker Act requires a plaintiff bringing suit against the government in the District Court to 'file a petition, duly verified with the clerk of the respective court having jurisdiction of the case.' Section 6 requires that 'the plaintiff ... cause \n\n[303 \nU.S. 567, 569]\n\u00a0\n a copy of his petition ... to be served upon the district attorney, ... and ... mail a copy ... to the Attorney General, ... and ... cause to be filed with the clerk of the court ... affidavit of such service and ... mailing.'\n March 22, 1927, the petitioner's claim for tax refund was disallowed. March 21, 1929, within two years after the disallowance, a duly verified petition was filed in the District Court claiming the refund. March 25, 1929, two years and four days after the disallowance, the petition was served on the United States Attorney and mailed to the Attorney General.\n The District Court held suit was not 'begun' by filing the verified petition and dismissed the cause of action. \n4\n The Court of Appeals affirmed. \n 5\n\u00a0\n\n It is conceded that suit in the Court of Claims is 'begun' when the petition is filed. Yet, it is insisted that suit is not 'begun' in the District Court when the petition is filed although the Court of Claims and the District Courts are given concurrent jurisdiction by the Tucker Act. Consideration of the history and language of the statute leads us to a different conclusion.\n Section 10 of the Act of March 3, 1863,6 provides that 'every claim against the United States cognizable by the Court of Claims, shall be forever barred unless the petition setting forth a statement (of the claim) is filed ... within six years after the claim first accrues.'\n When the Tucker Act in 1887 greatly expanded the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims and gave District Courts concurrent jurisdiction in all cases involving cer- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 567, 570]\n\u00a0\n tain amounts, its limitation in both the Court of Claims and the District Courts provided: 'No suit against the Government of the United States shall be allowed under this Act (paragraph) unless the same shall have been brought within six years after the right accrued.' Section 1, now Jud. Code  24(20), as amended, 28 U.S.C.A.  40(20).\n The substantial rights of claimants are to be governed alike whether suit is brought in the Court of Claims or the District Court. The author of the Tucker Act in declaring the statute of limitations applicable alike 'to any or all' of the cases arising under the Act drew no distinction between suits brought in the District Court and in the Court of Claims. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The purpose of giving the District Courts concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of Claims was to provide additional opportunity for the consideration and determination of claims that had 'long pressed upon the consideration of Congress'8 and to permit suit to 'be brought in the District where the parties reside.' \n9\n After discussing the benefits of previous legislation creating and extending the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, the Committee on the Judiciary reported to the House: 'The history of this legislation and its results have been given to show how much of benefit has been done in the satisfactory decisions of claims against the Government and in relief of the Congress. But it has long been felt that the benefits could be made much greater by extending the jurisdiction of the Court. ... It is needless to say more than has already been intimated as to the general policy of this legislation. The large mass of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 567, 571]\n\u00a0\n business now before Congress growing out of private claims consumes its time year after year in committee work, rendered useless by the lack of time to consider and pass upon them. Just claims are painfully deferred without interest, and the credit of the Government, so strictly upheld upon its bonded debt, is justly censured in respect to its honest and private claims.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n In response to the needs disclosed by this report Congress passed the Tucker Act, manifestly intending to provide adequate opportunity for expeditious and orderly determination of claims against the Government. This Act not only expanded the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, but, for the first time, gave District Courts general authority to hear and determine claims against the Government. Relief of existing claim congestion and prevention of future congestion obviously demanded an integrated jurisdictional plan by which the Court of Claims and District Courts could afford equal opportunities for expeditious and fair trials of like claims within the jurisdictional amount of the District Courts. The erection of barriers to recovery in the District Courts which did not exist in the Court of Claims would have tended to defeat the prime objectives of the Act. Uniformity and equality in substantial rights and privileges-for claimants in both forums-were essential features in the system. Distinctions between the opportunities for recovery afforded in the two forums would have tended to mar the symmetry of the plan and to impair its effective and successful operation. As to substantial rights, Congress evidently meant to give claimants an identical status in both Courts where the amount in controversy was included in the jurisdiction of both. We find no support in the background or objective of the Act for a \n\n[303 \nU.S. 567, 572]\n\u00a0\n construction under which a claimant's rights would be preserved by filing a petition in the Court of Claims, but would be lost-without additional action-in the District Court.\n As said by this Court in United States v. Greathouse, \n166 \nU.S. 601, 606\n, 17 S.Ct. 701, 703: 'It was not contemplated that the limitation upon suits against the government in the district ... courts of the United States should be different from that applicable to like suits in the court of claims.'\n As used in this statute the word 'begun' should be given its ordinary and accustomed meaning. To begin is to start; to institute; to initiate; to commence. This suit was begun-within two years after the refund claim was disallowed-when the petion was filed in court in good faith. Notice was mailed the Attorney General and the District Attorney was promptly served-both within four days after the verified petition was filed. Under these circumstances, we do not consider what would be the effect of lack of diligence in obtaining service. \n11\n The judgment in the court below was not in harmony with the views here expressed and is\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 27, 44 Stat. 9, 116,  1113. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Chapter 359, 24 Stat. 505, 506,  5, 6, 28 U.S.C.A.  762, 763. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] U.S.C., title 28,  41(20), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(20), Judicial Code  24(20), as amended. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] D.C., 19 F.Supp. 526. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] 1 Cir., 93 F.2d 721. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] 12 Stat. 765, 767, now Jud.Code  156, 28 U.S.C.A.  262. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Congressional Record and Appendix, 49th Cong., 2d Sess., March 3, p. 2679. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] House Report No. 1077, 49th Cong., 1st Sess., by Mr. Tucker on the Tucker Bill. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Congressional Record and Appendix, 49th Cong., 2d Sess., March 3, p. 2679. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] House Rep.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1938)\nNo. 505\nArgued: Decided: January 10, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 573, 574]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frank J. Wideman, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner biddle.\n Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n Mr. Wm. R. Spofford, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent Elkins.\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 573, 575]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In their British income tax returns, stockholders in British corporations are required to report as income, in addition to the amount of dividends actually received, amounts which reflect their respective proportions of the tax paid by the corporation on its own profits. The principal question raised by these petitions is whether these amounts constitute 'income ... taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to ( a) foreign country' so as to entitle the stockholders, if they are citizens of the United States, to credits of those amounts upon their United States income tax, by virtue of section 131(a)(1) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A.  131(a)(1) and note. A further question is whether any of the amounts not so available as a credit may be deducted from gross income under section 23(c)(2) of the act, 26 U.S.C.A.  23 note, for the purpose of ascertaining the net income subject to tax.\n Petitioner in No. 55 and respondent in No. 505, hereafter called the taxpayers, received cash dividends during the taxable years 1929 and 1931, respectively, on their stock in three British corporations. Each of the corporations having itself paid or become liable to pay the British tax on the profits thus distributed, no further exaction at the 'standard' ( normal) rate was due the British government on account of the distribution from either the stock- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 573, 576]\n\u00a0\n holders or the corporation. \n1\n Only in the case of individuals whose income exceeds a stated amount is a surtax levied. In these circumstances the corporations are directed to certify to shareholders, at the time of sending out warrants for the dividends, the gross amount from which the income tax 'appropriate thereto' is deducted, the rate and amount of the income tax appropriate to the gross amount, and the net amount actually paid. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The tax 'appropriate' to the dividend is computed by applying the standard rate for the year of distribution, to the value of the money or other property distributed. \n3\n The amount so computed will equal the tax paid at the standard rate by the corporation on its profits if, but only if, the tax rate is the same in the year when the profits are earned as in the year when they are distributed.\n One of the companies availed itself of the statutory permission4 to declare a gross dividend, from which it deducted the tax before actual distribution, certifying to the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 573, 577]\n\u00a0\n taxpayers that the dividend would be paid 'less' income tax. The other two companies declared the dividend in the amount distributed to stockholders and certified that it was 'free of tax.' The certificates of the latter did not purport to show any deduction of tax from a gross dividend, but did indicate the amount of the tax appropriate to the dividend and showed the same net return to stockholders as if the tax had been deducted from a computed gross dividend.\n In their returns transmitted to the Department of Inland Revenue of the British government, the taxpayers reported as income subject to surtax the amount of income taxes appropriate to their dividends, in addition to the money actually received, and paid surtaxes on that total sum. In their United States income tax returns for those years, the taxpayers included in gross income the entire sums so reported in the British returns. Up to the limit set by section 131 (b), 26 U.S.C.A.  131 note, they claimed as credits against the tax payable to the United States the amount of British tax appropriate to the dividends as well as the amount of surtax paid. A deduction from gross income was claimed under section 23(c)(2), 26 U.S.C.A .  23 note, for the amount by which the limit was exceeded.\n Deficiency assessments of the taxpayers were brought to the Board of Tax Appeals for review. There the issues were narrowed to the questions now before us, whether the taxpayers, after adding to gross income the amounts included in the British returns as taxes appropriate to the dividends received, were then entitled to deduct those amounts from the tax as computed, to the extent permitted by section 131(b), and whether the excess was a permissible deduction from gross income.\n The Board held that the sums in dispute should not have been included in gross income, because they represented neither property received by the taxpayers nor the discharge of any taxes owed by them to the British \n\n[302 \nU.S. 573, 578]\n\u00a0\n government. It held further that section 131(a)(1) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A.  131(a) (1) and note, which directs that the income tax be credited with 'the amount of any income, ... taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to any foreign county' is inapplicable because the United Kingdom fails to tax dividends at the normal rate, and hence the taxes appropriate to dividends were paid by the corporations rather than the taxpayer stockholders.\n In No. 55 the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the determination of the board, 86 F.2d 718, since followed by that Circuit in F. W. Woolworth Co. v. United States, 91 F.2d 973, and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in No. 505, reversed, 91 F. 2d 534, following a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in United Shoe Machinery Corp. v. White, 89 F.2d 363. We granted certiorari, \n302 \nU.S. 664\n, 58 S.Ct. 10, 82 L.Ed. --; \n302 \nU.S. 677\n, 58 S.Ct. 147, 82 L.Ed. --, to resolve this conflict of decision, and because of the importance of the question in the administration of the revenue laws.\n At the outset it is to be observed that decision must turn on the precise meaning of the words in the statute which grants to the citizen taxpayer a credit for foreign 'income taxes paid.' The power to tax and to grant the credit resides in Congress, and it is the will of Congress which controls the application of the provisions for credit. The expression of its will in legislation must be taken to conform to its own criteria unless the statute, by express language or necessary implication, makes the meaning of the phrase 'paid or accrued,' and hence the operation of the statute in which it occurs depend upon its characterization by the foreign statutes and by decisions under them. Cf. Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292, 294\n, 38 S.Ct. 126; Weiss v. Weiner, \n279 \nU.S. 333, 337\n, 49 S.Ct. 337, 338; Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103, 110\n, 53 S.Ct. 74, 77.\n Section 131 does not say that the meaning of its words is to be determined by foreign taxing statutes and decisions, and there is nothing in its language to suggest that, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 573, 579]\n\u00a0\n in allowing the credit for foreign tax payments, a shifting standard was adopted by reference to foreign characterizations and classifications of tax legislation. The phrase 'income taxes paid,' as used in our own revenue laws, has for most practical purposes a well-understood meaning to be derived from an examination of the statutes which provide for the laying and collection of income taxes. It is that meaning which must be attributed to it as used in section 131.\n Hence the Board's finding, supported as it is by much expert testimony, that 'the stockholder receiving the dividend is regarded in the English income tax acts as having paid 'by deduction or otherwise' the tax 'appropriate' to the dividend,' is not conclusive. At most it is but a factor to be considered in deciding whether the stockholder pays the tax within the meaning of our own statute. That must ultimately be determined by ascertaining from an examination of the manner in which the British tax is laid and collected what the stockholder has done in conformity to British law and whether it is the substantial equivalent of payment of the tax as those terms are used in our own statute.\n We are here concerned only with the 'standard' or normal tax. The scheme of the British legislation is to impose on corporate earnings only one standard tax, at the source, and to avoid the 'double' taxation of the corporate income as it passes to the hands of its stockholders, except as they are subject to surtax which the corporation does not pay. The corporation pays the standard tax and against it the remedies for nonpayment run. It has been intimated that the shareholder may be held to payment of the tax in the event of the corporation's default, Hamilton v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue, 16 British Tax Cases, 213, 236, but the contrary view finds more support in judicial opinion, Id. at 230; Dalgety & Co., Ltd., v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue, 15 British Tax Cases, 216, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 573, 580]\n\u00a0\n 238; Neumann v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue, 18 British Tax Cases, 341, 345, 358, 362-363, 368, and was adopted by the taxpayers' expert.\n Although the corporation, in the United Kingdom as here, pays the tax and is bound to pay it, the tax burden in point of substance is passed on to the stockholders in the same way that it is passed on under our own taxing acts where the tax on the corporate income is charged as an expense before any part of the resulting net profit is distributed to stockholders. See Magill, Taxable Income, 24 et seq. Whether the tax is deducted from gross profits before a dividend is declared, or after, when the deduction is taken from the gross dividend, the net amount received by the stockholder is the same. Under either system, if no dividend is declared, no tax is paid by the stockholder. 5 If a dividend is declared, it must be paid, however the deduction is made, from what is left after the corporation has paid taxes upon its earnings. The differences in the two methods of deduction are to be found only in the formal bookkeeping data which, in the British system, are communicated to the stockholders, not for the purpose of laying or collecting the tax which the corporation has already paid or must pay, but to aid the stockholders in computing their surtax and in securing the benefit of any refund of the tax.\n The stockholders' surtax is computed upon the gross dividend, the dividend which he actually receives plus the tax deducted. \n6\n if the stockholder's income is exempt or less than the minimum amount subject to the tax, refund is made to him of the proportionate share of the tax paid \n\n[302 \nU.S. 573, 581]\n\u00a0\n by the corporation. \n7\n It is upon these features of the British system that the taxpayers chiefly rely to support their argument that the stockholder pays the tax. For these limited purposes, which do not affect the assessment and payment of the tax, it is true that the British acts treat the stockholder as though he were the taxpayer. But with respect to the surtax the stockholder pays it and the taxpayers here have received for its payment the credit which our statute allows. Inclusion of the deducted amount in the base on which surtax is calculated, together with the provisions for refund of the tax to the stockholder who, in any event, bears its economic burden, are logical recognitions of the British conception that the standard tax paid by the corporation is passed on to the stockholders.\n Our revenue laws give no recognition to that conception. Although the tax burden of the corporation is passed on to its stockholders with substantially the same results to them as under the British system, our statutes take no account of that fact in establishing the rights and obligations of taxpayers. Until recently they have not laid a tax, except surtax, on dividends, but they have never treated the stockholder for any purpose as paying the tax collected from the corporation. Nor have they treated as taxpayers those upon whom no legal duty to pay the tax is laid. Measured by these standards our statutes afford no scope for saying that the stockholder of a British corporation pays the tax which is laid upon and collected from the corporation, and no basis for a decision that section 131 extends to such a stockholder a credit for a tax paid by the corporation-a privilege not granted to stockholders in our own corporations. It can hardly be said that a tax paid to the Crown by a British corporation subject to United States income tax is not a tax paid \n\n[302 \nU.S. 573, 582]\n\u00a0\n within the meaning of section 23(c)(2), of the 1928 act, which allows a deduction from gross income for taxes paid to a foreign country, cf. Welch v. St. Helens Petroleum Co., Ltd., 9 Cir., 78 F.2d 631, or that its stockholders could take credit under section 131 for their share of the tax on the theory that they also had paid it.\n The taxpayers urge that departmental rulings sustaining credits or deductions by stockholders of British corporations, S.M. 3040, IV-1 C.B. 198; S.M. 5363, V-1 C.B. 89; I.T. 2401, VII-1 C.B. 126; G.C.M. 3179, VII-1 C.B. 240, have taken on the force of law by virtue of the re-enactment of the deduction and credit provisions carried into sections 23 and 131 of the 1928 Act. Laying aside the fact that departmental rulings not promulgated by the Secretary are of little aid in interpreting a tax statute, Helvering v. New York Trust Co., \n292 \nU.S. 455, 467\n, 468 S., 54 S.Ct. 806, 810, these rulings rest for their conclusions as to the application of section 131 upon their interpretation of the nature and effect of the British legislation. The presumption that Congress, in re- enacting a statute, can ascertain the course of administrative interpretation and, knowing its own intent, will correct the administrative ruling if mistaken, cannot apply to rulings upon the intent of other legislative bodies. So far as the rulings with which we are now concerned sought to state the force and effect of British law, they can have no more binding effect on courts than in the case of any determination of fact which calls into operation the taxing statutes. So far as they have construed our own statute as adopting the British characterization, they plainly misinterpret an unambiguous provision. Where the law is plain the subsequent re-enactment of a statute does not constitute adoption of its administrative construction. Iselin v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 245\n, 46 S.Ct. 248; Louisville & N.R. Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 740\n, 51 S.Ct. 297; Helvering v. New York Trust Co., supra. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 573, 583]\n\u00a0\n What we have said is decisive of the second question, whether any of the amounts not available for credit under section 131 may be deducted from gross income for the purpose of arriving at taxable net income. By section 23(c)(2) of the 1928 act the deductions of 'income ... taxes imposed by the authority of any foreign country' are limited to taxes paid or accrued. Since we have held that the taxpayer has not paid or become subject to the foreign tax here in question, the section by its terms is inapplicable. \n No. 55\n is affirmed.\n No. 505 is reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of opinion that the applicable rule was correctly stated by the lower court in No. 505, Elkins v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 91 F.2d 534, and by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in United Shoe Machinery Corp. v. White, 89 F.2d 363, and that the challenged judgment in No. 55 should be reversed and that in No. 505 affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] British Income Tax Act 1918, 8 and 9 Geo.

GORDON(1938)\nNo. 167\nArgued: Decided: January 31, 1938\n\n\n\n Messrs. Clement K. Corbin and E. A. Markley, both of Jersey City, N.J ., for petitioner.\n Mr. Aaron Gordon, of Jersey City, N.J., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The issue is whether the master of a vessel is entitled to the benefit of section 12 of the Act of March 4, 1915,1 exempting wages of seamen from attachment.\n The respondent recovered judgment against one Findlay, the captain of the tug Waverly, a registered vessel of the United States operating in New York Harbor. Under a state statute Findlay's wages due from his employer, the Erie Railroad Company, were attached by the service of an order on the petitioner, superintendent of the marine department of the railroad company. It is not disputed that if Findlay's wages were subject to \n\n[303 \nU.S. 91, 92]\n\u00a0\n garnishment the order, and its service upon the petitioner, were regular and lawful. The petitioner asserted that the federal statute exempted Findlay's wages from execution and refused to honor the order. Thereupon action was instituted by respondent against petitioner, pursuant to local statute which in such a case renders the recusant officer liable for the amount of the judgment. On the trial petitioner's motions for a nonsuit and for a directed verdict were denied and judgment went for the respondent. The petitioner successively appealed to the Supreme Court and the Court of Errors and Appeals. The judgment was affirmed. \n2\n Because of the importance of the question we granted the writ of certiorari, \n302 \nU.S. 667\n, 58 S.Ct. 24, 82 L.Ed. --.\n The words of the statute are: 'No wages due or accruing to any seaman or apprentice shall be subject to attachment or arrestment from any court.' While, within the purview of some of the acts concerning shipping a master is included in the class designated seamen, in others the expression excludes the master. \n3\n In this case we must determine whether Congress intended, by section 12 of the Act of 1915, 46 U.S.C.A.  601, to extend to a master the exemption of seamen's wages from garnishment. Decision is aided by a consideration of the provision in its original setting. It was first enacted as section 61 of the Act of June 7, 1872,4 which authorized the appointment of shipping commissioners to protect merchant seamen and to superintend their shipment and discharge. Scrutiny of the act as a whole leads to the view that in all matters affecting wages seamen were treated as a class which excluded masters; and this conclusion is required by section 65,5 which is in part: 'That to avoid doubt in the construction of this act, every person having the command of any ship belonging to any \n\n[303 \nU.S. 91, 93]\n\u00a0\n citizen of the United States shall, within the meaning and for the purposes of this act, be deemed and taken to be the 'master' of such ship; and that every person (apprentices excepted) who shall be employed or engaged to serve in any capacity on board the same shall be deemed and taken to be a 'seaman' within the meaning and for the purposes of this act.'\n In its present form the pertinent language of section 12 of the Act of March 4, 1915, is identical with that originally employed in section 61 of the Act of 1872, which became section 4536 of the Revised Statutes. Section 12 of the Act of March 4, 1915, re-enacted the section, adding a provision to make it applicable to fishermen employed on fishing vessels as well as to seamen. The statute is now section 601 of title 46 of the United States Code, 46 U.S.C.A.  601.\n Section 65 of the Act of 1872 became section 4612 of the Revised Statutes and, with immaterial amendments, now is section 713 of title 46 of the United States Code, 46 U.S.C.A.  713. Various other provisions of the Act of 1872 embodied in the Revised Statutes, either in their original form or as amended by the Act of March 4, 1915, and by the Merchant Marine Act of 1920,6 now appear, with provisions of other statutes, as sections of title 46 of the Code, 46 U.S.C.A. In compiling it the original language of section 65 of the Act of 1872, 'To avoid doubt in the construction of this act,' was, in section 713 of title 46, changed to read: 'In the construction of this chapter.' The change in phraseology has given rise to the impression that the definitions found in section 713 apply indifferently to the various statutes affecting merchant shipping. \n7\n To avoid confusion in determining the applicability of the definitions contained in that section, it is necessary to trace to their origin the substantive sections to which it may be deemed to refer, and to construe them in the light of the evident intent of Congress in the use \n\n[303 \nU.S. 91, 94]\n\u00a0\n of the word 'seaman' in the original act. Since the pertinent provision of section 12 of the Act of 1915, 46 U.S.C.A.  601, here under consideration and the definitions of section 713 of title 46 of the Code, 46 U.S.C.A.  713, were commonly derived from the Act of 1872 and have not been materially changed, they must be read in collocation, and when this is done, the intent of Congress to exclude masters from the exemption accorded seamen is plain. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioner contends that section 61 of the Act of 1872 was modified by the Act of June 9, 1874,9 whereby the provisions of the Act of 1872 were made inapplicable to vessels in the coastwise trade. The latter act has been carried into the Code as section 544 of title 46, 46 U.S.C.A .  544, and it is said that the repeal of section 61 by the Act of March 4, 1915, and the re-enactment of the section, slightly altered, did not operate to repeal the Act of 1874. In view of our decision that a master is not within the exemption granted by section 12 of the Act of 1915, 46 U. S.C.A.  601, we need not pass upon this question.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] C. 153, 38 Stat. 1164, 1169, U.S.C. tit. 46,  601, 46 U.S.C.A.  601. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 117 N.J.L. 40, 186 A. 689; 118 N.J.L. 159, 191 A. 761. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Warner v.

In view of the importance of the question in the administration of the federal statute, this Court granted certiorari, \n302 \nU.S. 678\n, 58 S. Ct. 134, 82 L.Ed. --.\n Petitioner was employed by the Wabash Railway Company as a car inspector in its yard at Granite City, Ill. He was injured in November, 1927, while inspecting a car which was one of a string of cars brought by the respondent, Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis, from St. Louis to Granite City and placed upon a track of the Wabash known as a 'receiving' or 'inbound' track. The purpose of the inspection was to determine whether the cars were to be accepted by the Wabash. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 10, 12]\n\u00a0\n Both the Wabash and the Terminal Companies were carriers engaged in interstate commerce.\n While making his inspection, petitioner stood upon one of the side ladders of the car, and in attempting to pull himself to the top of the car, petitioner took hold of a grabiron which, with the board to which it was attached, became loose, causing him to fall. The board was found to have 'become rotten from end to end on the under side, and to some extent on the upper side around the bolts by which the grabiron was attached to it.'\n Petitioner first sued his employer, the Wabash, under the provisions of the Federal Safety Appliance Act, but a judgment in his favor was reversed upon the ground that the car had not yet been accepted by the Wabash Company which therefore had not hauled or used it, or permitted it to be hauled or used, within the prohibition of the statute. Brady v. Wabash Railway Company, 329 Mo. 1123, 49 S.W.2d 24, 83 A.L.R. 655. While that suit was pending, petitioner brought the present suit against respondent.\n The federal statute, Act of April 14, 1910, c. 160,  2, 36 Stat. 298, 45 U.S.C.  11, 45 U.S.C.A.  11 provides that\n'it shall be unlawful for any common carrier subject to the provisions of this Act (chapter) to haul, or permit to be hauled or used on its line any car subject to the provisions of this Act (chapter) not equipped with appliances herein provided for, to wit: All cars must be equipped with secure sill steps and efficient hand brakes; all cars requiring secure ladders and secure running boards shall be equipped with such ladders and running boards, and all cars having ladders shall also be equipped with secure hand holds or grab irons on their roofs at the tops of such ladders.'\n\n The Act of 1910 supplemented the provisions of the Act of March 2, 1893, c. 196, 27 Stat. 532, 45 U.S.C.  1-7, 45 U.S.C.A.  1-7 which provided in section 8, 45 U.S.C.A.  7:\n'Any employee of any common carrier engaged in interstate commerce by railroad who may be injured by any locomotive, car, or train in use contrary to the provision \n\n[303 \nU.S. 10, 13]\n\u00a0\n of this chapter shall not be deemed thereby to have assumed the risk thereby occasioned, although continuing in the employment of such carrier after the unlawful use of such locomotive, car, or train had been brought to his knowledge.'\n\n See, also, Federal Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65, 66, c. 149 ,  4, 45 U.S.C.  54, 45 U.S.C.A.  54.\n The first question is whether the car can be said to have been in use by the respondent at the time in question. The statute gives no ground for holding that it was the intent of Congress that in a situation such as is here presented neither the Wabash nor the Terminal Association should be subject to the statutory duty. The 'use, movement or hauling of the defective car,' within the meaning of the statute, had not ended when petitioner sustained his injuries. Chicago Great Western R. Co. v. Schendel, \n267 \nU.S. 287, 291\n, 292 S., 45 S.Ct. 303, 304. The car had been brought into the yard at Granite City and placed on a receiving track temporarily pending the continuance of transportation. If not found to be defective, it would proceed to destination; if found defective, it would be subject to removal for repairs. It is not a case where a defective car has reached a place of repair. See Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Hooven, 6 Cir., 297 F. 919, 921, 923; New York, C. & St. L.R. Co. v. Kelly, 7 Cir., 70 F.2d 548, 551. The car in this instance had not been withdrawn from use. Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co., \n196 \nU.S. 1, 21\n, 22 S., 25 S.Ct. 158; Delk v. St. Louis & San Francisco R. Co., \n220 \nU.S. 580\n, 584-586, 31 S.Ct. 617; Great Northern Railway Co. v. Otos, \n239 \nU.S. 349, 351\n, 36 S.Ct. 124; Chicago Great Western R. Co. v. Schendel, supra. The car was still in use, though motionless. Minneapolis, St. Paul & Sault Ste. Marie Rwy. Co. v. Goneau, \n269 \nU.S. 406, 409\n, 46 S.Ct. 129, 130. In view of that use, either the Terminal Association or the Wabash was subject to the obligation imposed by the statute.\n The question then is whether the responsibility of the Terminal Association, which brought in the car, had ended. We think that question is answered by the un- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 10, 14]\n\u00a0\n disputed fact that it was placed by the Terminal Association on the receiving track to await inspection and acceptance by the Wabash.\n The Wabash had not accepted it. The jury, which found for petitioner, were instructed that as a condition of that verdict it was necessary for them to find that petitioner 'was required to go upon said car for the purpose of inspecting the equipment thereon and of accepting or rejecting said car on behalf of his employer, the Wabash Railway Company.' We cannot agree with the view, expressed in the opinion of the state court, Mo.Sup., 102 S.W.2d 903, 907 in reversing the judgment, that, 'granted that the cars were still (in the legal sense) in the possession of the Terminal,' it might still be held that 'the right of control' had passed to the Wabash. As the Wabash had not accepted the car, the Wabash had not assumed control and petitioner was examining the car in order to determine whether the Wabash should assume control.\n As the car had not been withdrawn from use and was still in the possession of the Terminal Association, its statutory obligation continued and the question is whether that duty was owing to petitioner. The fact that petitioner was not an employee of the Terminal Association did not necessarily absolve it from duty to him. We have said that 'the nature of the duty imposed by a statute and the benefits resulting from its performance' usually determine what persons are entitled to invoke its protection. It was in this view that we held that the power brakes required by the Safety Appliance Act were not only for the safety of railway employees and passengers on trains but also of travelers on the highways at railway crossings. Fairport, P. & E.R. Co. v. Meredith, \n292 \nU.S. 589, 596\n, 597 S., 54 S.Ct. 826, 829. In the instant case, petitioner in the course of his duty would have occasion to go upon the car and use the grabiron, and accordingly the benefit of the statute would extend to him, although \n\n[303 \nU.S. 10, 15]\n\u00a0\n he was not employed by the carrier holding the car in use, unless he was outside the scope of the statute because of the special character of his work. His work was that of inspection to discover defects of the sort here found to exist as well as others.\n This final question must be determined in the light of the nature of the obligation resting upon the carrier in relation to the use of a defective car. The statutory liability is not based upon the carrier's negligence. The duty imposed is an absolute one, and the carrier is not excused by any showing of care, however assiduous. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & S. Rwy. Co. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281, 295\n, 28 S.Ct. 616; Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Rwy. Co. v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 559, 570\n, 31 S.Ct. 612; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Layton, \n243 \nU.S. 617, 620\n, 621 S., 37 S.Ct. 456, 457; Great Northern Railway Co. v. Otos, supra. The breadth of the statutory requirements is shown by the fact that it embraces all locomotives, cars, and similar vehicles used on any railway that is a highway of interstate commerce and is not confined exclusively to vehicles engaged in such commerce. Southern Railway Company v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20\n, 32 S.Ct. 2. Laying down this comprehensive rule as a matter of public policy, Congress has made no exception of those employed in inspecting cars. The statute has been liberally construed 'so as to give a right of recovery for every injury the proximate cause of which was a failure to comply with a requirement of the Act.' Swinson v. Chicago, St. P., M. & O. Rwy. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 529, 531\n, 55 S.Ct. 517. 96 A.L.R. 1136. In Davis v. Wolfe, \n263 \nU.S. 239, 243\n, 44 S.Ct. 64, 66, reviewing the earlier cases, the Court held that one can recover 'if the failure to comply with the requirements of the Act is a proximate cause of the accident resulting in injury to him while in the discharge of his duty, although not engaged in an operation in which the safety appliances are specifically designed to furnish him protection.' Even where the required equipment is known to have become defective and the car is being hauled to the nearest avail- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 10, 16]\n\u00a0\n able point for repairs, while the act relieves the carrier in such a case from the prescribed penalties, the carrier still remains subject by the express terms of the statute to civil liability for injuries sustained by 'any railroad employee' in the course of such a movement by reason of the defective equipment. Act of April 14, 1910, c. 160,  4, 36 Stat. 299, 45 U.S.C.  13, 45 U.S.C.A.  13. See New York, C. & St. L.R. Co. v. Kelly, supra.\n We think that these considerations require the conclusion that one is not to be denied the benefit of the act because his work was that of inspection for the purpose of discovering defects As we said in Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Layton, supra, the liability 'springs from its being made unlawful to use cars not equipped as required,-not from the position the employee may be in, or the work which he may be doing at the moment when he is injured,' provided the defective equipment is the proximate cause of the injury.\n The fact that petitioner was looking for defects of the sort which caused his injury does not prevent recovery as the statute expressly excludes the defense of assumption of risk. 45 U.S.C.  7, 54, 45 U.S.C.A .  7, 54.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE CO. v. CITY OF REDDING(1938)\nNo. 976\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1938\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of California. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 252, 253]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Warren Olney, Jr., of San Francisco, Cal., Seth W. Richardson, of Washington, D.C., Francis Carr, of Redding, Cal., and A. Crawford Greene, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellants.\n Messrs. George Herrington and W. H. Orrick, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n This suit was brought by appellants, California Water Service Company and Carlo Veglia, to enjoin the City of Redding, California, from receiving a grant of $162,000, allotted by the Federal Administrator of Public Works under title II of the National Industrial Recovery Act and supplemental legislation,1 to aid the city in the construction of a municipal waterworks system; and also to enjoin the city from expending the proceeds of the sale of $200,000 of the city's bonds for the purpose of constructing such a plant. The bill of complaint alleged that the grant of federal funds and the legislation said to authorize it were invalid under the Federal Constitution, article 1,  1, 8 and 9; article 2,  1 and 3; and the Tenth Amendment, and also that the grant was in violation of the federal statutes cited. The suit was brought prior to the decision of this Court in the case of Alabama Power Company v. Ickes, \n302 \nU.S. 464\n, 58 S.Ct. 300. The bond issue of the city was alleged to be invalid under the constitution and statutes of California.\n Temporary and permanent injunctions were sought and the District Court, 22 F.Supp. 641, composed of three judges convened under section 3 of the Act of August 24, 1937, 50 Stat. 751, 752, 28 U.S.C.A.  380a, decided that the bill of complaint stated no cause \n\n[304 \nU.S. 252, 254]\n\u00a0\n of action within the cognizance of the court. The temporary restraining order was dissolved and the complaint was dismissed. The case comes here on appeal. Appellees move to dismiss or affirm.\n The District Court held that the federal question sought to be raised was identical with that presented in Alabama Power Company v. Ickes, supra; that the asserted distinction that the proposed action of defendants, the Federal Administrator not being a party, was motivated by a desire or purpose to injure or coerce the plaintiff Company, was of no avail, as the city was free to bargain with the plaintiff and to construct a rival system if the plaintiff chose not to sell its plant and the motive actuating the city in the exercise of its rights was immaterial. See Isbrandtsen-Moller Company v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 139, 145\n, 57 S.Ct. 407, 410. In the absence of a substantial federal question, the court ruled that the charge that the bonds of the city were invalid under the state law presented a purely local issue which the court was not required to consider.\n We are of the opinion that these rulings were correct. We have held that section 266 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  380, does not apply unless there is a substantial claim of the unconstitutionality of a state statute or administrative order as there described. It is therefore the duty of a district judge, to whom an application for an injunction restraining the enforcement of a state statute or order is made, to scrutinize the bill of complaint to ascertain whether a substantial federal question is presented, as otherwise the provision for the convening of a court of three judges is not applicable. Ex parte Buder, \n271 \nU.S. 461, 467\n, 46 S.Ct. 557, 559; Ex parte Poresky, \n290 \nU.S. 30\n, 54 S.Ct. 3. We think that a similar rule governs proceedings under Section 3 of the Act of August 24, 1937, 28 U.S.C.A.  380a, as to the participation of three judges in passing upon applications for injunctions restraining the en- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 252, 255]\n\u00a0\n forcement of federal statutes upon the ground of constitutional invalidity. Had the decisions in the cases of Alabama Power Company v. Ickes, supra, and of Duke Power Company v. Greenwood County, \n302 \nU.S. 485\n, 58 S.Ct. 306, been rendered prior to the filing of the bill of complaint in the instant case, no substantial federal question would have been presented. The lack of substantiality in a federal question may appear either because it is obviously without merit or because its unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of this court as to foreclose the subject. Levering & Garrigues Co. v. Morrin, \n289 \nU.S. 103, 105\n, 106 S., 53 S.Ct. 549. And, here, although the bill of complaint had been previously filed, and a motion for an interlocutory injunction presented, it was apparent after our decisions in the cases cited that the federal question was without substance and it became the duty of the District Court to dismiss the bill of complaint upon that ground.\n In Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Company, \n292 \nU.S. 386, 391\n, 54 S.Ct. 732, we had occasion to observe (page 734) that 'the three-judge procedure is an extraordinary one, imposing a heavy burden on federal courts, with attendant expense and delay'; that 'that procedure, designed for a specific class of cases, sharply defined, should not be lightly extended'; and that restrictions placed upon appellate review in this court 'would likewise be measurably impaired were groundless allegations thus to suffice.' We concluded that 'when it becomes apparent that the plaintiff has no case for three judges, though they may have been properly convened, their action is no longer prescribed.'\n It is also clear that the presentation of a local question in the instant case as to the invalidity of the city's bonds under the state law did not suffice to save jurisdiction. While, if the court had jurisdiction by reason of the presence of a substantial federal question, it could \n\n[304 \nU.S. 252, 256]\n\u00a0\n proceed to pass upon the local issue (Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Garrett, \n231 \nU.S. 298, 303\n, 34 S.Ct. 48; Davis v. Wallace, \n257 \nU.S. 478, 482\n, 42 S.Ct. 164, 165; Sterling v. Constantin, \n287 \nU.S. 378, 393\n, 394 S., 53 S.Ct. 190, 193; Railroad Commission v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co., \n302 \nU.S. 388, 391\n, 58 S.Ct. 334 82 L.Ed. 319), it was the presence of the federal question which gave the court that authority, and in its absence, through lack of substance, the court was not entitled to go further. In Norumbega Company v. Bennett, \n290 \nU.S. 598\n, 54 S.Ct. 207, the District Court of three judges, considering that a federal constitutional question was involved, passed upon the question of the construction of the state statute and, denying a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, dismissed the bill of complaint for want of equity. D.C., 3 F.Supp. 500, 502. This Court reversed the decree and remanded the cause with directions to dismiss the bill of complaint for the want of jurisdiction because of the absence of a substantial federal question.\n We think that the Act of August 24, 1937, did not contemplate that a court of three judges should be convened, or, if convened, should continue to act, merely for the decision of a local question where no substantial federal question is involved. We agree with the District Court that the attempt to blend the contention as to the validity of the bond issue under state law with the question as to the authority to make the federal grant under the federal statutes, so as to give the former the aspect of a federal question, is unavailing. The local question and the federal question are distinct. See Hurn v. Oursler, \n289 \nU.S. 238, 245\n, 246 S., 53 S. Ct. 586, 589\n\n\n The court below rightly dismissed the bill of complaint and the motion to affirm its decree is granted.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took not part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Acts of June 16, 1933, c. 90, 48 Stat. 200-210, 40 U.S.C.A.  401 et seq.; April 8, 1935, c. 48, 49 Stat. 115-119; June 29, 1937, c. 401,  201-207, 50 Stat. 352, 15 U.S.C.A.  721 et seq. note. \n\n\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCALMAR S.S.

It is attended by interruptions of the blood stream, with consequent malnutrition of the affected parts, producing lesions, deteriorating changes of the tissues, and gangrene. Medical treatment and amputation of the affected parts may halt the advance of the disease, but its manifestations are likely to recur in other parts of the body, and medical opinion is that the disease tends to be progressive and may ultimately cause death. Care and treatment at frequent intervals, with periodic medical observation of the patient, are of aid in arresting its progress.\n After February 12, 1935, when respondent was first hospitalized, he was given treatment at various marine hospitals, in the course of which he suffered four amputations upon the right foot and leg. On October 3, 1935, after his leg had been amputated below the knee, he \n\n[303 \nU.S. 525, 527]\n\u00a0\n was discharged to the 'Outpatient Department to return at intervals for re- examination, and later to be fitted with an artificial limb.' Petitioner, from time to time, paid respondent small sums for maintenance and cure, continuing to do so until March 10, 1936, when they totaled $487. At about this time respondent brought the present suit in admiralty to recover maintenance and cure, and, in another count, for petitioner's negligence in causing the injury. The trial court found that petitioner was not negligent, but held that respondent is entitled to recover the cost of maintenance and medical treatment so long as such treatment is necessary, and that as his affliction is incurable, there should be a lump sum award based on his life expectancy. Its decree awarding a recovery of $7,000 was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 3 Cir., 92 F.2d 84. Because of the importance of this question, we granted certiorari, \n302 \nU.S. 681\n, 58 S.Ct. 408, 82 L.Ed. --, but denied a cross-petition to review the Court of Appeals' affirmance of the decree for the shipowner on the negligence count. \n303 \nU.S. 643\n, 58 S.Ct. 642, 82 L.Ed. --.\n The ancient duty of a vessel and her owner to provide maintenance and cure for seamen injured or falling ill while in service was recognized and, to some extent, defined by this Court in The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158, 175\n, 23 S.Ct. 483. See, also, Chelentis v. Luckenbach S.S. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 372\n, 38 S.Ct. 501; Pacific S.S. Co. v. Peterson, \n278 \nU.S. 130\n, 49 S.Ct. 75. The duty, which arises from the contract of employment, Cortes v.Baltimore Insular Line, \n287 \nU.S. 367, 371\n, 53 S.Ct. 173, 174, does not rest upon negligence or culpability on the part of the owner or master, Id; The City of Alexandria, D.C., 17 F. 390; The Mars, 3 Cir., 149 F. 729, 731; Sorensen v. Alaska S.S. Co., D.C., 243 F. 280, affirmed 9 Cir., 247 F. 294; Brown v. The Bradish Johnson, C.C., Fed.Cas.No.1992, 1 Woods 301, nor is it restricted to those cases where the seaman's employment is the cause of the injury or illness, The Wensleydale, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 525, 528]\n\u00a0\n D.C., injury or illness, The Wensleydale, D.C., F. 831. It is not an award of compensation for the disability suffered, The Wanderer, C.C., 20 F. 140, 143, although breach of the duty may render the owner liable for the consequential damages suffered by the seaman, Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, supra, \n287 \nU.S. 367\n, at page 371, 53 S.Ct. 173, 174. The maintenance exacted is comparable to that to which the seaman is entitled while at sea, The Henry B. Fiske, D.C., 141 F. 188, 192; The Mars, D.C., 145 F. 446, 447, affirmed 3 Cir., 149 F. 729; The Bouker No. 2, supra, 2 Cir., 241 F. 831, at page 836, and 'cure' is care, including nursing and medical attention during such period as the duty continues, Whitney v. Olsen, 9 Cir., 108 F. 292, 297 and cases cited; Dougherty v. Thompson-Lockhart Co., D.C., 211 F. 224, 227.\n In The Osceola, supra, this Court reserved the point whether the duty of maintenance and cure extends beyond the duration of the voyage, and that question, so far as this Court is concerned, remains an open one. The reasons underlying the rule, to which reference must be made in defining it, are those enumerated in the classic passage by Mr. Justice Story in Harden v. Gordon, C.C., Fed.Cas.No.6047: The protection of seamen, who, as a class, are poor, friendless and improvident from the hazards of illness and abandonment while ill in foreign ports; the inducement to masters and owners to protect the safety and health of seamen while in service; the maintenance of a merchant marine for the commercial service and maritime defense of the nation by inducing men to accept employment in an arduous and perilous service.\n It is plain that in many cases these purposes will not be accomplished if the owner's duty to furnish maintenance and cure ends with the voyage. If the injury or illness outlasts it, the seaman may still be left helpless and uncared for in a foreign port. Even if he is returned \n\n[303 \nU.S. 525, 529]\n\u00a0\n to the home port the inducement to the owner to care for the health and safety of seamen during the voyage and the inducement to seamen to take the necessary risks of a hazardous calling will be materially lessened. The chances of their prompt restoration to a service whose preservation is in the public interest, will be diminished if the right to maintenance and cure ends with the voyage.\n Tacit recognition is accorded these considerations in the great number of cases in the lower federal courts sustaining the right to maintenance and cure for a reasonable time after the voyage-'reasonable time' being appraised with reference to the special circumstances of each case. The Bouker No. 2, supra, 2 Cir., 241 F. 831, at page 835, and cases cited at page 834. It is true that in most of these cases the efficient cause of the injury or illness was some proven act of the seaman in the service of the ship, but there are others in which it was deemed enough that he was incapacitated when subject to the call of duty as a seaman, and that his incapacity continued after the voyage had ended. The Bouker No. 2, supra, 2 Cir., 241 F. 831, at page 835; The Wensleydale, supra.\n We accept as supported by evidence, the finding of the District Court that respondent's disease and the amputations which he suffered were not caused by the injury to his foot. But we think that even in such a case, whether the seaman is at home or abroad, his right to maintenance and cure may outlast the voyage. The policy underlying the obligation, so cogently stated by Justice Story in Harden v. Gordon, supra, and the liberality with which admiralty courts have traditionally interpreted rules devised for the benefit and protection of seamen who are its wards, Robertson v. Baldwin, \n165 \nU.S. 275, 287\n, 17 S.Ct. 326; Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, supra, \n287 \nU.S. 367\n, at page 377, 53 S. Ct. 173, 176; The Arizona v. Anelich, \n298 \nU.S. 110, 123\n, 56 S.Ct. 707, 711, call for some extension of the duty beyond the term of service. The practical inconvenience and the attendant danger to seamen in the application of a rule which would en- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 525, 530]\n\u00a0\n courage the attempt by master or owner to determine in advance of any maintenance and cure, whether the illness was caused by the employment, are manifest.\n There remain the questions whether in the case of a chronic illness the duty continues so long as medical attendance and care are beneficial, until death if the need lasts so long, and whether a lump sum may be awarded to defray the cost of meeting the anticipated need.\n In answering the first we lay to one side those cases where the incapacity is caused by the employment. As to them considerations not present here may apply, which might be thought to require a more liberal application of the rule than we think is called for in this case. Cf. Reed v. Canfield, C.C., Fed.Cas.No.11641, with the comments of Judge, later Justice, Brown in The J. F. Card, D.C., 43 F. 92, and see those of Judge Hough in The Bouker No. 2, supra, 2 Cir., 241 F. 831, at page 834. But we find no support in the policies which have generated the doctrine for holding that it imposes on the shipowner an indefinitely continuing obligation to furnish medical care to a seaman afflicted with an incurable disease, which manifests itself during his employment, but is not caused by it. So far as we are advised, it is without support in the authorities. We can find no basis for saying that, if the disease proves to be incurable, the duty extends beyond a fair time after the voyage in which to effect such improvement in the seaman's condition as reasonably may be expected to result from nursing, care, and medical treatment. This would satisfy such demands of policy as underlie the imposition of the obligation. Beyond this we think there is no duty, at least where the illness is not caused by the seaman's service.\n The award of a lump sum in anticipation of the continuing need of maintenance and cure for life or an indefinite period is without support in judicial decision. Awards of small amounts to cover future maintenance \n\n[303 \nU.S. 525, 531]\n\u00a0\n and cure of a kind and for a period definitely ascertained or ascertainable have occasionally been made. The Mars, 3 Cir., 149 F. 729, 730; Wilson v. Manhattan Canning Co., D.C., 205 F. 996, 997. But the award here seems to us to be inconsistent with the measure of the duty and the purposes to be effected by its performance. The duty does not extend beyond the seaman's need. Raymond v. The Ella S. Thayer, D.C., 40 F. 902, 903; The J. F. Card, supra, D.C., 43 F. 92, at page 95; The Bouker No. 2, supra, 2 Cir., 241 F. 831, at page 835; The Santa Barbara, 2 Cir., 263 F. 369, 371; Stewart v. United States, D.C., 25 F.2d 869, 870; Marshall v. International Mercantile Marine Co., 2 Cir., 39 F.2d 551, 553; cf. Holt v. Cummings, 102 Pa. 212, 48 Am.Rep. 199; contra, Reed v. Canfield, supra. The amount and character of medical care which will be required in the case of an affliction, as well defined even as Buerger's disease, cannot be measured by reference to mortality tables. Moreover, courts take cognizance of the marine hospital service where seamen may be treated at minimum expense, in some cases without expense, and they limit recovery to the expense of such maintenance and cure as is not at the disposal of the seaman through recourse to that service. The Bouker No. 2, supra, 2 Cir., 241 F. 831, at page 835; Marshall v. International Mercantile Marine Co., supra, 2 Cir., 39 F.2d 551, at page 553, and cases cited. Furthermore, a duty imposed to safeguard the seaman from the danger of illness without succor, and to safeguard him, in case of illness, against the consequences of his improvidence, would hardly be performed by the payment of a lump sum to cover the cost of medical attendance during life.\n The seaman's recovery must therefore be measured in each case by the reasonable cost of that maintenance and cure to which he is entitled at the time of trial, including, in the discretion of the court, such amounts as may be needful in the immediate future for the maintenance \n\n[303 \nU.S. 525, 532]\n\u00a0\n and cure of a kind and for a period which can be definitely ascertained.\n The courts below have made no findings sufficient to enable us to fix the amount which respondent is entitled to recover. The decree is accordingly reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion, and without prejudice to any later suit by respondent to recover maintenance and cure to which he may then be entitled.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK is of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Motion to retax costs denied 59 S.Ct. 56, 83 L.Ed. --. \n\n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCENTURY INDEMNITY CO. v.

Sweet, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 213, 214]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This cause went up by appeal from the District Court, Northern District, California. Of the twenty-eight assignments of error, eleven, based upon the trial court's refusal of certain requested special findings, were rejected by the Circuit Court of Appeals. It held the requests 'were made too late,' that 'the findings were proposed after the trial had been completed and after the court had announced its decision and hence did not occur during the trial.' To support this view it cited Continental National Bank v. National City Bank, 9 Cir., 69 F.2d 312, 317, which affirms-'It is settled that they (requests for findings) come too late if made after judgment, even though the trial judge after judgment granted leave to make the request.'\n A jury having been duly waived, the trial judge heard evidence. At the conclusion of this counsel for both sides made motions for judgment and findings. The minutes of May 31, 1934, shows: 'This case having been heretofore heard and submitted and due consideration having been had, it is ordered that judgment be entered for plaintiff, with interest and costs, upon findings of facts and conclusion of law to be presented.'\n The bill of exceptions recites: 'Thereafter (after requests for judgment and findings) the case was orally argued before the court and was submitted upon written briefs. Thereafter and on June 1, 1934, (May 31?) and outside the presence of the parties, the Court made and entered its order granting judgment to the plaintiff with findings to be submitted. Thereafter proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law were served and lodged with the Court by plaintiff, and within the time allowed by law the defendant served and lodged its proposed special findings of fact and conclusions of law in lieu of those proposed by the plaintiff. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 213, 215]\n\u00a0\n Thereafter and on June 16, 1934, the Court, without the presence of the parties, signed the proposed special findings of fact and conclusions of law of the plaintiff and filed same on said date as the findings and conclusions of the Court, and judgment was entered on said June 16, 1934.'\n June 16, 1934, 'Special Findings and Conclusions of Law' presented for plaintiff Nelson were signed by the District Court and were filed. The document concluded thus:\n'From the foregoing Findings of Fact the court concludes that judgment should be entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant in the sum of Six Thousand ($6000.00) Dollars together with interest thereon at the legal rate of seven (7%) per annum from the date of the commencement of this action, to-wit: September 24, 1931, together with plaintiff's costs of suit incurred herein, and that upon satisfaction of said Judgment the Clerk of this court should deliver to the defendant the assignment by plaintiff against the San Francisco Iron & Metal Company, a corporation in bankruptcy.\n\n'Let judgment be entered accordingly.'\n\n Section 875, Title 28, U.S.C.A., is in the margin;1 also Rule 42, District Court, Northern District of California. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 213, 216]\n\u00a0\n We are unable to accept the conclusion below that within the intent of the statute the 'progress of the trial' ended on June 1, when the court ordered 'that judgment be entered for plaintiff, with interest and costs, upon findings of fact and conclusions of law to be presented,' and thereafter it was too late adequately to present special findings of fact. The qualifying words in the order, 'upon findings of fact and conclusions of law to be presented,' are appropriate to suggest 'merely a preliminary order' and reservation of opportunity for further action. Considering them along with Rule 42 and the subsequent action by counsel for both sides and the court-all without suggestion of objection-it appears plain enough that all parties understood the cause was 'inprogress of trial' until entry of the final judgment on June 16. Rule 42 is susceptible of the interpretation insisted upon by counsel for petitioner and ap- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 213, 217]\n\u00a0\n parently they proceeded in good faith according to that view. In so doing, we think they were right. See Clement v. Phoenix Ins. Co., Fed.Cas. No. 2, 882.\n Continental National Bank v. National City Bank, supra, does not discuss Rule 42 and went upon facts which seem materially different from those presented by this record.\n Refusal to consider the eleven assignments of error arose from what we regard as wrongful interpretation and application of section 875, 28 U. S.C.A. and Rule 42. Their evident purpose is to insure orderly and timely presentation to the judge of matters deemed important in advance of any definite action by him in respect of them. They should not be so narrowly construed as to defeat their real purpose.\n It is not necessary in the circumstances to treat the first order for judgment (June 1) as ending 'the progress of the trial.' All counsel and the presiding judge seem, rightly we think, to have entertained a wholly different view and to have acted accordingly.\n The challenged judgment must be reversed.

Arthur Miller, of Chicago, Ill., and Roy G. Fitzgerald, of Dayton, Ohio, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondents, creditors of a Federal Joint Stock Land Bank located in Illinois, brought the present suit in the District Court for Southern Ohio to collect a 100 per cent. assessment of the statutory double liability of its shareholders, which had previously been decreed in a suit brought by respondents in the District Court for Northern Illinois. In the Illinois suit the bank and all its stockholders were named as parties defendant, but the present defendants, petitioners here, who are stockholders residing in Ohio, were not served with process. A motion in the District Court to dismiss the present suit raised the question whether the bill of complaint, which sets up the decree of the court in the Illinois suit in which it states petitioners were not served with process, but does not allege that the bank is insolvent or show any necessity for the assessment, states a cause of action. The District Court gave judgment for petitioners which the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. Brusselback v. Arnovitz, 87 F.2d 761. We granted certiorari, Christopher v. Brusselback, \n302 \nU.S. 672\n, 58 S.Ct. 16, 82 L.Ed. --, to resolve a conflict between the decision of the court below and that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Holmberg v. Carr, 86 F.2d 727. Compare Brusselback v. Cago Corporation, 2 Cir., 85 F.2d 20.\n The question decisive of the case is whether petitioners are bound by the Illinois adjudication, in their absence, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 500, 502]\n\u00a0\n of the bank's insolvency, and the amount of the assessment. Section 16, Federal Farm Loan Act, July 17, 1916, c. 245, 39 Stat. 374, 12 U.S.C.  812, 12 U.S.C.A.  812, provides, 'Shareholders of every joint-stock land bank organized under this Act (chapter) shall be held individually responsible, equally and ratably, and not one for another, for all contracts, debts, and engagemnts of such bank to the extent of the amount of stock owned by them at the par value thereof, in addition to the amount paid in and represented by their shares.'\n Before respondents had brought the Illinois suit this Court in Wheeler v. Greene, \n280 \nU.S. 49\n, 50 S.Ct. 21, had before it the provisions of the Federal Farm Loan Act which authorize the Farm Loan Board to declare a joint-stock land bank insolvent, and to place it in the hands of a receiver. Section 29, Federal Farm Loan Act, July 17, 1916, c. 245, 39 Stat. 381, 12 U.S.C.  931, 963, 12 U.S.C.A.  961, 963 and notes. We held that those provisions do not confer upon the Federal Farm Loan Board any power to levy an assessment on the stockholders, or give to the receiver authority to maintain suit for the enforcement of their statutory liability, or otherwise set up any machinery comparable to that of the National Banking Act, 12 U.S.C.A.  21 et seq., for enforcing the stockholders' liability. Compare Rankin v. Barton, \n199 \nU.S. 228, 232\n, 26 S. Ct. 29; Casey v. Galli, \n94 \nU.S. 673\n; Id., \n94 \nU.S. 680\n, 681. The only means of enforcing the liability left to creditors of a joint-stock land bank, as the Court pointed out in the Wheeler Case, is an adversary suit in equity against the stockholders wherever they may be found.\n The obligation which the statute imposes upon the stockholders is personal, and petitioners can be held to respond to it only by a suit maintained in a court having jurisdiction to render a judgment against them in personam. As the liability of the stockholders is to pay the debts of the bank to creditors 'equally and ratably,' judicial determination of the inability of the bank to pay \n\n[302 \nU.S. 500, 503]\n\u00a0\n its debts and the amount to be assessed against the stockholders to meet the deficiency are prerequisites to the enforcement of liability, and are essential parts of the only cause of action which the statute gives to the creditors. It is plain that in such a suit the existence and extent of insolvency are facts, the allegation and proof of which cannot be dispensed with as to any stockholder unless, as between the parties to the suit, they are matters already adjudicated.\n A stockholder is so far an integral part of the corporation of which he is a member, that he may be bound and his rights foreclosed by authorized corporate action taken without his knowledge or participation. Sanger v. Upton, \n91 \nU.S. 56\n, 58. The subscriber to corporate stock, whose subscription is payable on call of the directors, as required for corporate purposes, is bound by the action of the board in making the call as he is bound by a valid decree of a court against the corporation, although made in his absence, which directs performance of the corporate duty to make the call. Hawkins v. Glenn, \n131 \nU.S. 319, 329\n, 9 S.Ct. 739; Great Western Telegraph Co. v. Purdy, \n162 \nU.S. 329, 336\n, 16 S.Ct. 810; cf. Kerrison v. Stewart, \n93 \nU.S. 155\n. Similarly, where a procedure is authorized by statute, under which a corporation may be brought into court for determination of its insolvency and the amount to be assessed against stockholders for the payment of its debts, and the judgment is declared by statute to be binding upon them, they are deemed by virtue of their membership in the corporation to have so far subjected themselves to the prescribed procedure and its consequences as to be bound by the determination although not nominal parties to the proceeding.

Peketz, \n297 \nU.S. 609\n, 56 S.Ct. 602.\n Whether it be said that by purchasing or retaining his stock in the face of such a procedure the stockholder has \n\n[302 \nU.S. 500, 504]\n\u00a0\n consented that the corporation represent him for the purposes of the adjudication, Bernheimer v. Converse, supra, \n206 \nU.S. 516, 529\n, 532 S., 533, 27 S.Ct. 755; Marin v. Augedahl, supra, \n247 \nU.S. 142, 150\n, 38 S.Ct. 452, or more realistically that as stockholder he has voluntarily assumed a corporate relationship which is subject to the local regulatory power, in the exercise of which the procedure has been attached as an incident, to his membership in the corporation, Converse v. Hamilton, supra, \n224 \nU.S. 243, 260\n, 32 S.Ct. 415, Ann.Cas. 1913D, 1292, in either case the procedure conforms to accepted principles, involves no want of due process, Converse v. Hamilton, supra; Selig v. Hamilton, supra; Chandler v. Peketz, supra, and at least when it ripens into a judgment is entitled to full faith and credit. Marin v. Augedahl, supra. It is enough that in every case the stockholder has assumed or retained his membership in the corporation after the warning of the statute, or of rules governing the corporation, of which he knew or had opportunity to know, that the benefits of membership carry with them the risk that the corporation may stand in judgment for him.\n In the present case no such warning has been given, for no such procedure has been prescribed. The statutes have fixed only the conditions on which liability of the stockholders is to attach, leaving to creditors as their only recourse the usual procedure of courts as the means of asserting the liability. There is nothing in the statute relating to the organization of federal land banks and the imposition of the stockholders' liability to suggest that by virtue of their membership in the corporation the stockholders can be said to have subjected themselves to a procedure for determining in their absence the essential conditions of liability, or to have relinquished their right to contest, as in any other litigation, every step essential to its establishment. As we cannot say that petitioners' membership in the bank was conditioned upon their surrender of the benefits of a procedure which would other- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 500, 505]\n\u00a0\n wise be required, there is no basis for a court to dispense with it more than in other cases in which a personal judgment is sought.\n Equity Rule 38, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723, providing that in a class suit 'one or more (of a class) may sue or defend for the whole,' was adopted in the exercise of the authority conferred on this Court by Rev.St.  913, 28 U.S.C.A.  723, and of its own inherent power to regulate by rules 'the ... modes of proceeding in suits of equity.' Their purpose was to prescribe the procedure in equity to be followed in cases within the jurisdiction of the federal courts and not to enlarge their jurisdiction. The omission from old Rule 48 amended and promulgated as Rule 38 in 1914, \n226 \nU.S. 659\n, of the phrase '... the decree shall be without prejudice to the rights and claims of all absent parties' preserved unimpaired the jurisdiction of federal courts of equity in a class suit to render a decree binding upon absent defendants affecting their interest in property within the jurisdiction of the court.

YOSEMITE PARK & CURRY CO.(1938)\nNo. 870\nArgued: Decided: May 31, 1938\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of California.\n\n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 520]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Seibert L. Sefton and U.S. Webb, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellants. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 521]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James S. Moore, Jr., of San Francisco, Cal., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellee, the Yosemite Park and Curry Co., brought this suit to enjoin the State Board of Equalization and the State Attorney eneral from enforcing the 'Alcoholic Beverage Control Act' of the State of California, 1 within the limits of Yosemite National Park. Appellee is engaged in operating, within the Park, hotels, camps, and stores, under a contract with the Secretary of the Interior, leasing portions of the Park to appellee for a 20-year term. The contract, expressly intended to implement the Congressional desire to make the Park a resort and playground for the benefit of the public, places upon appellee the duty of furnishing visitors with sundry facilities and accommodations. If it pays dividends in excess of 6% on its investment it must pay to the Secretary of the Interior a sum equal to 25% of the excess during the first ten years, and 22 1\/2% of any excess over six per cent. earned during the second ten years. Appellee sells liquors, beer and wine to Park visitors for prices approved by the Secretary of the Interior. In the ordinary course of business, it imports from places outside of California beer, wine, and distilled spirits, which it stores and sells within the Park.\n According to the allegations of appellee's bill, appellants ( defendants below) assert that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act applies within the Park and that appellee is obligated to apply for permits for importation and \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 522]\n\u00a0\n sale; that appellee is subject to provisions of the Act prohibiting the issuance of importer's licenses to persons holding on-sale retail licenses, and vice versa; that appellee must pay fees and taxes imposed by the Act or be subject to penalties. Allegation was made that appellants threaten to seize beverages on or being transported to appellee's premises, demand rendition of reports and keeping of accounts, and threaten to institute civil and criminal proceedings against appellee for violation of the Act. On the other hand, appellee's allegations continue, the Secretary of the Interior, under the contract of lease, has approved prices making no allowance for taxes, and has instructed appellee to apply for no license and to pay no tax under the California Act, and that payment of such license fees or taxes will not be allowed as an operating expense under the contract.\n Appellee brought this suit to restrain enforcement of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act within Yosemite Park, on the theory that the Park is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. The suit being one to restrain the enforcement of a State statute as applied to a specific situation, a three-judge court was convened under section 266 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  380. The case was heard below upon motion to dismiss the complaint. The District Court denied this motion. It granted a temporary injunction (20 F.Supp. 1009), and later granted the final injunction prayed for by the complaint, restraining appellants (a) from entering upon appellee's premises, examining its records, seizing its beverages, or interfering with its importation and sales of beverage within the Park; (b) from interfering with shipments to appellee from outside the State; (c) from instituting any actions based on alleged violations of the Act with respect to the importation, possession, or sale of liquors; (d) from requiring reports thereon; (e) from enforcing the Act as to transactions within the Park. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 523]\n\u00a0\n The District Court, after noting that Yosemite National Park consists of Yosemite Valley and considerable surrounding territory, first discussed what it conceived to be the situation in the Valley. \n2\n It reviewed the history of the land; the United States acquired it in 1848 under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,3 reserved proprietary rights when California became a State in 1850, Act Sept. 9,4 and on June 30, 1864, gave the Valley to California in trust for public park and recreational purposes. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The District Court held that exclusive jurisdiction over the land was acquired again by the United States by virtue of the joint operation of three statutes: an 1891 California law ceding to the United States exclusive jurisdiction over such land as might be ceded to it;6 a 1905 California statute receding the Valley to the United States;7 and the Act of June 11, 1906, 16 U.S.C.A.  47 et seq., \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 524]\n\u00a0\n whereby Congress accepted the regrant and constituted the Valley a part of the Yosemite National Park. \n8\n It further held, over appellants' objection, that there was no constitution obstacle to the acquisition by the United States of exclusive jurisdiction over land ceded to it for national park purposes. Jurisdiction over the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 525]\n\u00a0\n rest of the Park, it concluded, was in the State until April 15, 1919, when it was offered to the national government (which had always retained the proprietary interest) in a statute saving to the State, inter alia, 'the right to tax persons and corporations, their franchises and property on the lands included in said parks.' \n9\n Ju- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 526]\n\u00a0\n risdiction of the Park was assumed by the United States by Act of June 2, 1920, which referred to the state act, including its reservation of a power to tax. \n10\n The District Court held this reservation inapplicable, on the ground that the Alcoholic Beverage Act is chiefly regulatory in nature rather than a revenue measure. Concluding that the United States had exclusive jurisdiction over the land in question, the District Court enjoined the enforcement of the state Act.\n From this final decree of injunction, a direct appeal to this Court was taken under sections 238 and 266 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  345, 380. Several questions were argued on the appeal. At this point, reference may be confined to appellants' contention that the United States has no \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 527]\n\u00a0\n power under the Constitution to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over land ceded to it by a state for national park purposes. Pursuant to the Act of August 24, 1937, 28 U.S.C.A.  401, the Court certified to the Attorney General that in this cause was drawn in question the constitutionality of the Acts of June 11, 1906, 34 Stat. 831, 16 U.S.C.A.  47 et seq., and June 2, 1920, 41 Stat. 731, 16 U.S.C.A.  57 et seq., accepting exclusive jurisdiction over the areas which embrace the Yosemite National Park. The United States, regarding appellee's argument as adequate, determined that it was not necessary to intervene.\n Exclusive jurisdiction. By the Act of March 3, 1905, see note 7, California ceded and granted the United States title to the 'Cleft' or 'Gorge,' known as Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree Grove. As the Act of March 31, 1891, was then in force, see note 6, exclusive jurisdiction, with the exception of right to administer criminal laws and serve civil process, passed to the United States, on its acceptance, unless the United States was without constitutional power to exercise it. By the Act of June 11, 1906, see note 8, the Congress accepted the cession and made the lands conveyed a part of the Yosemite National Park. The other lands composing the Park had been in the proprietorship of the national government since cession by Mexico. Exclusive jurisdiction of them passed from the United States to California by the admittance of that State to the Union. Except for certain rights expressly reserved, exclusive jurisdiction of these lands was granted to the United States by the Act of April 15, 1919, see note 9, and accepted by the Congress on June 2, 1920, see note 10. As this Act granted exclusive jurisdiction over all 'territory which is now or may hereafter be included in ... 'Yosemite National Park,\" the language of the cession and acceptance is apt to determine exclusive jurisdiction, with the explicit reservations, of the Gorge also. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 528]\n\u00a0\n Whatever the existing status of jurisdiction at the time of their enactment, the Acts of cession and acceptance of 1919 and 1920 are to be taken as declarations of the agreements, reached by the respective sovereignties, State and Nation, as to the future jurisdiction and rights of each in the entire area of Yosemite National Park. As jurisdiction over the Gorge was created by one set of statutes and that over the rest of the Park by different legislation, this adjustment was desirable. The States of the Union and the National Government may make mutually satisfactory arrangements as to jurisdiction of territory within their borders and thus in a most effective way, cooperatively adjust problems flowing from our dual system of government. \n11\n Jurisdiction obtained by consent or cession may be qualified by agreement or through offer and acceptance or ratification. \n12\n It is a matter of arrangement. These arrangements the courts wil recog nize and respect.\n The State urges the constitutional inability of the national government to accept exclusive jurisdiction of any land for purposes other than those specified in clause 17, section 8, Article 1 of the Constitution, U.S.C.A. Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 17.13 This clause has not been strictly construed. This Court at this term has given full consideration to the constitutional power of \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 529]\n\u00a0\n the United States to acquire land under Clause 17 without taking exclusive jurisdiction. \n14\n In that case, it was said: 'Clause 17 contains no express stipulation that the consent of the state must be without reservations. We think that such a stipulation should not be implied. We are unable to reconcile such an implication with the freedom of the state and its admitted authority to refuse or qualify cessions of jurisdiction when purchases have been made without consent, or property has been acquired by condemnation.' The clause is not the sole authority for the acquisition of jurisdiction. There is no question about the power of the United States to exercise jurisdiction secured by cession, though this is not provided for by clause 17.15 And it has been held that such a cession may be qualified. 16 It has never been necessary, heretofore, for this Court to determine whether or not the United States has the constitutional right to exercise jurisdiction over territory, within the geographical limits of a State, acquired for purposes other than those specified in Clause 17. It was raised but not decided in Arlington Hotel Co. v. Fant, \n278 \nU.S. 439, 454\n, 49 S.Ct. 277, 230. It was assumed without discussion in Yellowstone Park Transportation Co. v. Gallatin County, 9 Cir., 31 F.2d 644.17\n On account of the regulatory phases of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act of California, it is necessary to determine that question here. The United States has large bodies of public lands. These properties are used for \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 530]\n\u00a0\n forests, parks, ranges, wild life sanctuaries, flood control, and other purposes which are not covered by Clause 17. In Silas Mason Co. v. Tax Commission of Washington, \n302 \nU.S. 186\n, 58 S.Ct. 233, we upheld in accordance with the arrangements of the State and Ntional Government the right of the United States to acquire private property for use in 'the reclamation of arid and semi-arid lands' (page 243) and to hold its purchases subject to state jurisdiction. In other instances, it may be deemed important or desirable by the national government and the state government in which the particular property is located that exclusive jurisdiction be vested in the United States by cession or consent. No question is raised as to the authority to acquire land or provide for national parks. As the national government may, 'by virtue of its sovereignty' acquire lands within the borders of states by eminent domain and without their consent,18 the respective sovereignties should be in a position to adjust their jurisdictions. There is no constitutional objection to such an adjustment of rights. It follows that jurisdiction less than exclusive may be granted the United States. The jurisdiction over the Yosemite National Park is exclusively in the United States except as reserved to California, e.g., right to tax, by the Act of April 15, 1919, St.Cal.1919, p. 74. As there is no reservation of the right to control the sale or use of alcoholic beverages, such regulatory provisions as are found in the Act under consideration are unenforceable in the Park.\n Interpretation of Reservations. The lower court, in interpreting the language of the Acts of grant and acceptance was of the opinion that the saving of 'the right to tax persons and corporations, their franchises and property' was not sufficiently broad to justify the collec- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 531]\n\u00a0\n tion of fees for licenses under section 5 and sales under sections 23 and 24 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act. 19 The retention of the right to charge license fees for fishing \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 532]\n\u00a0\n was considered an indication of abandonment of the right to enforce any other license fees and finally, the regulatory character of the California enactment was deemed to mark it as non-enforceable under the reservation of the right to tax.\n As the respective acts of State and Nation were in the nature of a mutual declaration of rights, this is not an occasion for strict construction of a grant by a State limiting its taxing power. Without employing that rule, we are of the opinion that this language is sufficiently broad to cover excises on sales,20 but not the license fees \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 533]\n\u00a0\n provided for by this Act. The fact that the 'right to fix and collect license fees for fishing in said parts' was reserved, is not decisive. It may well be that the negotiators of the agreement considered such licenses regulatory in nature and therefore requiring express exception from the agreement for exclusive jurisdiction, in addition to the tax exception.\n\n\n (a)\n Licenses. As the State of California has in the area of the Yosemite National Park only the jurisdiction saved under the cession and acceptance acts of 1919 and 1920, it does not have the power to regulate the liquor traffic in the Park. Except as to this reserved jurisdiction, California 'put that area beyond the field of operation of her laws.' \n21\n While the State has, under its reservation, the right to use means to force collection of the taxes saved, 22 it seems clear that the licenses required by section 5 go beyond aids to the collection of taxes and are truly regulatory in character. This is not a case where provisions requiring a license may be treated as separable from regulations applicable to those licensed. \n23\n Here the regulatory provisions appear in the form of conditions to be satisfied before a license may be granted. \n24\n The pro- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 534]\n\u00a0\n visions requiring licenses for the importation or sale of alcoholic beverages in the Park are invalid.\n\n\n (b)\n Excise Taxes. A different conclusion obtains, however, with respect to the excise tax provisions of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, laying a tax, at a specified rate per unit sold, on beer, wine, and distilled spirits sold 'in this State.' The Park Company, seeking to bring the excise provisions of the Act within the principle stated above with respect to the license fee provisions, contends that, notwithstanding the separability clause,25 the taxing features cannot be separated from the regulatory features, and that 'the Act does not even purport to tax persons not subject to licensing requirements.' Thus the argument is made that section 23, St.1937, p. 2143, imposes an excise tax on beer and wine sold by an importer, and applies not to the Company, which sells beverages direct to consumers, but only to importers licensed under the Act, and restricted by their license to sales to retail licensees. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 535]\n\u00a0\n Neither party cites any pertinent state court decision. There is nothing in the statute itself compelling the conclusion that the excise tax and regularly provisions are inseparble, or requiring the Court to overturn the presumptively correct determination of the administrative officers that the sales within the Park are subject to the excise tax. Section 23 provides that an excise tax is imposed upon beer and wine sold 'in this State by (an) ... importer.' Reference to provisions of the Act defining the terms used in this section26 makes it plain that although appellee Company does not import beverages into California within the meaning of the Twenty-First Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. Amend. 21, it is an importer for purposes of the Act, and, as such, is subject to the tax. The Act is restricted to sales 'in his State,' but that term embraces all territory within the geographical limits of the State. \n27\n There is nothing in the Act restricting this taxing provision to sales made by or to persons licensed under the Act. Section 23 clearly applies to beer and wine sold by appellee Company in the Park, and it applies to such sales regardless of the applicability vel non of the regulatory or licensing provisions of the Act.\n Section 24, St.1937, p. 2144, imposes an excise tax upon all distilled spirits 'sold in this State by rectifiers or wholesalers.' Appellee Company does not come within the statutory \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 536]\n\u00a0\n definition of either of these groups,28 but Sec. 24 must be read in conjunction with section 33, St.1937, p. 2153. Section 33 provides that the 'tax imposed by section 24 of this act upon the sale of distilled spirits shall be collected from rectifiers and wholesalers of distilled spirits and payment of the tax shall be evidenced by stamps issued by the board to such rectifiers and wholesalers,' and continues with the provision that 'in exceptional instances the board may sell such stamps to on- and off-sale distilled spirits licensees and other persons.' (Italics added.) In view of the atypical circumstances of the present case, we cannot consider erroneous an interpretation by the board that stamps, to be affixed to the liquor containers, might be issued and sold to appellee Company. These provisions, like sec. 23, are independent of any licensing or regulatory provisions of the Act, and may be enforced independently, as a purely tax or revenue measure.\n The objection that collection of the taxes may not only interfere with an agency of the United States but may be actually partly collected from the National Government because of its interest in the profits under the contract is fully answered by the fact that the United States, by its acceptance of qualified jurisdiction, has consented to such a tax. \n29\n\u00a0\n\n XXI Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. The State makes the point that section 2 of the XXI Amendment30 gives it the right to regulate \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 537]\n\u00a0\n the importation of intoxicating liquors. Reliance for enforcement is placed upon secions 49 and 49.2 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act. \n31\n The argument for this claim is bottomed upon our decision in State Board of Equalization v. Young's Market Co., \n299 \nU.S. 59\n, 57 S.Ct. 77, where we held that a statute imposing a $500 license fee for importing and a $750 license fee for brewing beer did not violate \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 538]\n\u00a0\n the commerce clause or the equal protection clause, because the words of the XXI Amendment 'are apt to confer upon the state the power to forbid all importations' and 'the State may adopt a lesser degree of regulation than total prohibition' (pages 62, 63, 57 S.Ct. page 78).32 The lower court was of the opinion that though the Amendment may have increased 'the state's power to deal with the problem; ... it did not increase its jurisdiction.' (page 1013 of 20 F.Supp.) With this conclusion, we agree. As territorial jurisdiction over the Park was in the United States, the State could not legislate for the area merely on account of the XXI Amendment. \n33\n There was no transportation into California 'for delivery or use therein.' The delivery and use is in the Park, and under a distinct sovereignty. Where exclusive jurisdiction is in the United States, without power in the State to regulate alcoholic beverages, the XXI Amendment is not applicable. \n34\n\u00a0\n\n Conclusion. The bill of complaint states that the defendants, the State officials, 'assert that said Alcoholic Beverage Control Act of the State of California applies to complainant's operations within said Yosemite National Park; ... that it is obligated to pay the fees and taxes imposed by said Act and is subject to the penalties thereof for the possession and sale of said beverages without compliance with the provisions of said Act.' In the prayer of the bill, the complainant prays for an injunction restraining the defendants 'from enforcing in any manner within the limits of Yosemite National Park, or in respect of transactions within said Park, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act of the State of California.' \n\n[304 \nU.S. 518, 539]\n\u00a0\n The final decree forbids entering upon the premises of complainant; seizing, impeding or interfering with any shipments to complainant in Yosemite National Park; from instituting any actions or proceedings in any court of law or equity for violations or alleged violations of said Alcoholic Beverage Control Act in respect of the importation, possession or sale in the Park; from requiring or demanding reports on the importation, possession or sale of said beverages; from enforcing in any manner within the limits of Yosemite National Park, or in respect of transactions within said Park, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act of the State of California.\n From the pleadings and decree it is clear that until now the controversy has trned not upon special provisions of the Act in question but upon its applicability as a whole. As in our judgment, as heretofore pointed out, the tax provisions are enforceable and the regulatory provisions unenforceable, it is necessary to reverse the decree and remand the cause to the District Court for a determination by the Court in accordance with this opinion of the applicability of such sections of the Act as the State may threaten to enforce.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the decree below should be reversed because as stated by counsel for appellants, 'The acts of cession and acceptance reserved to the state the right to levy upon and collect from the appellee company the type of tax imposed by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act.' Also, that discussion should be confined to that point.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cal.Stat.1935, c. 330, p. 1123, as amended, Cal.Stat.1937, c. 681, 758, pp. 1934, 2126 \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The discussion applies equally to the Mariposa Big Tree Grove. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 9 Stat. 922. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] 9 Stat. 452. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] 13 Stat. 3 25. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] 'Section 1.

REVENUE(1938)\nNo. 30\nArgued: October 21, 1938Decided: November 7, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 23, 24]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Morrison Shaforth, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Carlton Fox, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Edwin B. Hendrie of Denver, Colorado, January 26, 1925, executed a will wherein he gave his property, with relatively small exceptions, to trustees to be held for the benefit of his daughter, Gertrude Hendrie Grant, and her children. January 7, 1927, when eighty years old and in good health, he irrevocably conveyed in trust to the Colorado National Bank, securities of large value-perhaps $800,000. The deed among other things provided that the income should be accumulated during the donor's life; after his death and during the life of his daughter Gertrude so much thereof as she asked should be paid to \n\n[305 \nU.S. 23, 25]\n\u00a0\n her and the remainder added to the principal; upon her death the corpus should be distributed to her descendants, etc.\n Hendrie died July 15, 1932. His 1925 will was duly probated and under it property worth some $900,000 passed. The Commissioner ruled that the 1927 trust was set up in contemplation of death within the meaning of section 302(c), Revenue Act of 1926, as amended,1 treated the property in the trustee's hands as part of the gross estate, and assessed taxes thereon accordingly.\n The Board of Tax Appeals considered the relevant facts and held the conveyance of 1927 'was not made in contemplation of death within the meaning of the statute as explained in United States v. Wells, \n283 \nU.S. 102\n, 51 S.Ct. 446.'\n The Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the transfer was in contemplation of death, and reversed the Board's decision. We think this was error. The decision of the Board should have been approved.\n The court declared-'Each case must be determined by its own facts and circumstances. ... It is settled law that a finding of fact made by the Board of Tax Appeals will not be disturbed on review if it is supported by substantial evidence. But whether there is substantial evidence to support a finding is a question of law. ... And a finding not thus supported will be set aside.' 95 F.2d 163. These statements are in accord with our holdings. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 23, 26]\n\u00a0\n Also it said-'The test lies in the motive for the transfer. If the generating source of the motive is associated with life, the transfer is not made in contemplation of death. But if the generating inducement is associated with death, either immediate or distant, the transfer is made in such contemplation. A gift is made in contemplation of death where the dominant motive of the donor is to make proper provision for the object of his bounty after the death of the donor.'\n Following a review of the evidence it said-'The dominant purpose was to make provision for his descendants after his death, in the event his speculations proved tragic. It was to place that substantial amount of property in an asylum of immunity from adverse consequences of speculation, in order to make certain that it would be used for his daughter and her children after his death. ... The purpose was a commendable one, but the generating motive for a transfer made in such circumstances is associated with death.'\n In the light of the views so stated the court concluded there was no substantial evidence to establish that the transfer was not made in contemplation of death. One judge, dissenting, declared-'It seems clear from the uncontradicted testimony that Mr. Hendrie's gift to his daughter and her children was not made in contemplation of death but in order that he might speculate upon the stock market for the remainder of his life more actively than he had in the past without fear that the part of his fortune thus given might be lost. He manifested no other intent and purpose in that respect.'\n There was evidence which the Board thought adequate, and which we deem substantial, to support its conclusion. Dominant purpose was a question of fact for determination by the Board.\n The court's opinion seems to rest upon an erroneous interpretation of the term 'in contemplation of death.' \n\n[305 \nU.S. 23, 27]\n\u00a0\n The meaning of this was much discussed in United States v. Wells, supra. We adhere to what was there said. The mere purpose to make provision for children after a donor's death is not enough conclusively to establish that action to that end was 'in contemplation of death.' Broadly speaking, thoughtful men habitually act with regard to ultimate death but something more than this is required in order to show that a conveyance comes within the ambit of the statute.\n Here, the Board having before it all the circumstances, including the provisions of the will, concluded that they disclosed an effective motive not directly springing from apprehension of death. And as pointed out by the dissenting judge there was substantial basis for that view. Its action is in accord with principles accepted by us in Shukert v. Allen, \n273 \nU.S. 545\n, 47 S.Ct. 461, 49 A.L.R. 855; Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339\n, 49 S.Ct. 123, 66 A.L.R. 397; May v. Heiner, \n281 \nU.S. 238\n, 50 S.Ct. 286, 67 A.L.R. 1244; McCormick v. Burnet, \n283 \nU.S. 784\n, 51 S.Ct. 343; Becker v. St. Louis Union Trust Co., \n296 \nU.S. 48\n, 56 S.Ct. 78.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed. The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is approved.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice REED concurs on the ground that the conclusion of the Board that the transfer was not made in contemplation of death was justified. There was substantial evidence of a life motive and the Board did not find an effective motive in contemplation of death.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n The purpose of Congress in providing that property transferred to a trust should be included in the transferor's gross estate when transferred in contemplation of death1 was to prevent evasion of the progressively grad- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 23, 28]\n\u00a0\n uated estate tax through the use of trust devices which actually operated as substitutes for testamentary disposition of property. \n2\n The will made by Mr. Hendrie at the age of seventy-eight in 1925 and the trust agreement substituted for it at eighty (as to a large part of his property) two years later in 1927 were substantially identical as to parties, recipients of his property, amounts, terms and conditions. Neither the will nor the trust agreement permitted any payments to the beneficiaries until the death of Mr. Hendrie.\n The stipulated evidence as to expressions by the donor of his motive for making the trust agreement showed that:\n He 'wanted to transfer about one third of his assets in the interest of his daughter and her heirs so that whatever might happen to his own financial affairs in the future, those persons would be provided for. He said he desired to retain for himself his most speculative securities and to feel free to speculate with that property during the rest of his life, but to put the other one-third beyond his own reach and risk. He said he desired and intended to 'play on the market' to a greater extent and in a more speculative way for the remainder of his life.' (Italics supplied.)\n At 'one time he stated ... that his daughter and his grandchildren would be adequately provided for in the event of his, the said Hendrie's death, through the medium of a trust which he had created, regardless of his operations on the Stock Exchange.'\n In reaching the conclusion that the stipulated facts in this case showed as a matter of law that the trust gift was made in contemplation of the donor's death within the meaning of the congressional act, the court below said in part: \n\n[305 \nU.S. 23, 29]\n\u00a0\n 'The trust was not designed to make provision for the beneficiaries during his life. None of the property or the increment thereto was to reach them until after his death. Neither was it designed to enable him to engage in speculation. He could have done that unfettered and unrestrained without the establishment of the trust. But in its absence the property transferred would have been subject to the hazards of speculation. It would have been within reach of creditors if he lost all. The dominant purpose was to make provision for his descendants after his death, in the event his speculations proved tragic. It was to place that substantial amount of property in an asylum of immunity from adverse consequences of speculation, in order to make certain that it would be used for his daughter and her children after his death. It was to make assurance doubly sure that provision was made for them, not during his life but after his death.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The Board of Tax Appeals did not pass upon conflicting evidence. And there is no indication that the Board believed that any conflicting inferences could be drawn from the stipulated facts. Stating that 'the Commissioner relies upon the fact that the income was to be accumulated and added to corpus during the life of the donor and, consequently, the beneficiaries were to receive nothing until after the death of the decedent' the Board did no more than say that they thought 'the transfer was not made in contemplation of death within the meaning of the statute as explained in United States v. Wells, \n283 \nU.S. 102\n, 51 S.Ct. 446' and that 'Therefore, on this point, we hold for the petitioners.' That the Board reached its conclusion on this single principle is clearly indicated by its statement that 'Principles announced in the cases above listed control this case which is not distinguishable from one or more of those cases where, as here, income was to \n\n[305 \nU.S. 23, 30]\n\u00a0\n be accumulated until after the death of the donor.' (Italics supplied.)\n The decision in United States v. Wells, supra, is not controlling on the present facts. There the Court pointed out that, in effect, the findings of the lower court showed that the gift involved \"was the carrying out of a policy long followed by decedent in dealing with his children of making liberal gifts to them during his lifetime. He had consistently followed that policy for nearly thirty years, and the three transfers in question were a continuation and final consummation of such policy. In the last transfer such amounts were given to his children as would even them up one with another, in the gifts and advancements made to them.\n\"That this was the motive which actuated the decedent in making these transfers seems unquestioned.\" (page 449.)\n\n Here, the donor had never followed any such policy. His will indicated that he was motivated not by a desire to give his children and grandchildren property while he was yet living, but to provide for them after his death. In the Wells Case, supra, page 117, 51 S.Ct. page 451, this Court said that 'the motive which induces the transfer must be of the sort which leads to testamentary disposition'. That the motive of the donor in this case was of the kind 'which leads to testamentary disposition' is conclusively shown by the facts that the trust agreement was an actual substitute for a previous will; that the sole motive shown in all of the evidence was to provide for the donor's children and grandchildren after his death so he would be 'free for the rest of his life to speculate in whatever securities he might wish' without subjecting the property intended for his children and grandchildren to 'the vicissitudes of his speculations.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 23, 31]\n\u00a0\n Congress has provided that upon review of a judgment of the Board of Tax Appeals the 'Courts shall have power to affirm or, if the decision of the Board is not in accordance with law, to modify or to reverse the decision of the Board, with or without remanding the case for a rehearing, as justice may require.' \n5\n Although this statute indicates an intent on the part of Congress to make the findings of fact of the Board conclusive, this Court holds that such findings are not conclusive unless supported by substantial evidence. 6 This Court has also said that the ultimate finding by the Board of Tax Appeals is a 'conclusion of law or at least a determination of a mixed question of law and fact' which is 'subject to judicial review and, on such review, the court may substitute its judgment for that of the Board.' \n7\n Under this rule-with which I am not in accord-but which governed the Court of Appeals, I believe that Court correctly decided that the Board had no substantial evidence to justify its erroneous ultimate determination of the mixed question of law and fact here. For that reason I think the judgment should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9:\n'Sec. 302.

Allen, \n273 \nU.S. 545\n, 47 S.Ct. 461, 49 A.L.R. 855; Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339\n, 49 S.Ct. 123, 66 A.L.R. 397; May v.

Marshall Bullitt, of Louisville, Ky., and B. M. Anderson, of Hartford, Conn., for appellant. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 77, 78]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Neil Cunningham, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant is a Connecticut corporation, admitted to do an insurance business in California. In addition to its business conducted within that state it has entered into contracts with other insurance corporations likewise licensed to do business in California, reinsuring them against loss on policies of life insurance effected by them in California and issued to residents there. These reinsurance contracts were entered into in Connecticut where the premiums were paid and where the losses, if any, were payable. The question for decision is whether a tax laid by California on the receipt by appellant in Connecticut of the reinsurance premiums during the years 1930 and 1931, infringes the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n In suits brought in the state court by appellant against respondent, state treasurer, to recover the taxes paid, the Supreme Court of California sustained demurrers to the complaints and gave judgments for the respondent. The cases, having been consolidated, come here on a single appeal under section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U. S.C.A.  344(a).\n Section 14 of article 13 of the California Constitution, as supplemented by Act of March 5, 1921 (Stats.1921, c. 22, pp. 20, 21, Political Code,  3664b), fixing the rate of tax, lays upon every insurance company doing business within the state an annual tax of 2.6 per cent. 'upon the amount of the gross premiums received upon its business done in this state, less return preiums and reinsurance in companies or associations authorized to do business in this state.' The Supreme Court of California has declared that the constitutional provision imposes \n\n[303 \nU.S. 77, 79]\n\u00a0\n 'a franchise tax exacted for the privilege of doing business' in the state. Consolidated Title Securities Co. v. Hopkins, 1 Cal.2d 414, 419, 35 P.2d 320, 323; compare Carpenter v. People's mutual Life Insurance Co., Cal.Sup. 74 P.2d 708.\n Although in terms the 'gross premiums received upon ... business done in this state,' less the specified deductions, are made the measure of the tax, the state court in this, as in an earlier case, Connecticut General Life Insurance Co. v. Johnson, 3 Cal.2d 83, 43 P.2d 278 (appeal dismissed for want of a properly presented federal question, \n296 \nU.S. 535\n, 56 S.Ct. 103), has held that the measure includes the premiums on appellant's reinsurance policies effected and payable in Connecticut. In this case it has declared also that the policy of the state, expressed in the constitutional provision, is 'to avoid double taxation without any loss of revenue to the stae.' To accomplish that end the deduction of reinsurance premiums paid to companies authorized to do business within the state is allowed, it is said, on the theory that the benefit of the deduction will be passed on to the reinsurer who, being authorized to do business within the state, may be taxed on the reinsurance premiums as a means of equalizing the tax and as an offset against the benefit of the deduction which he ultimately enjoys.\n No contention is made that appellant has consented to the tax imposed as a condition of the granted privilege to do business within the state. Nor could it be, for it appears that appellant had conducted its business in California under state license for many years before the taxable years in question and before the taxing act was construed by the highest court of the state, in Connecticut General Life Insurance Co. v. Johnson, supra, to apply to premiums received in Connecticut from reinsurance contracts effected there. A corporation which is allowed to come into a state and there carry on its business may \n\n[303 \nU.S. 77, 80]\n\u00a0\n claim, as an individual may claim, the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment against a subsequent application to it of state law. Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Harding, \n272 \nU.S. 494\n, 47 S.Ct. 179, 49 A.L.R. 713, compare Kentucky Finance Corporation v. Paramount Auto Exchange Corporation, \n262 \nU.S. 544\n, 43 S.Ct. 636\n\n\n It is said that the state could have lawfully accomplished its purpose if the statute had further stipulated that the deduction should be allowed only in those cases where the reinsurance is effected in the state or the reinsurance premiums paid there. But as the state has placed no such limitation on the allowance of deductions, the end sought can be attained only if the receipt by appellant of the reinsurance premiums paid in Connecticut upon the Connecticut policies is within the reach of California's taxing power. Appellee argues that it is, because the reinsurance transactions are so related to business carried on by appellant in California as to be a part of it and properly included in the measure of the tax; and because, in any case, no injustice is done to appellant since the effect of the statute as construed is to redistribute the tax, which the state might have exacted from the original insurers but did not, by assessing it upon appellant to the extent to which it has received the benefit of the allowed deductions.\n But the limits of the state's legislative jurisdiction to tax, prescribed by the Fourteenth Amendment, are to be ascertained by reference to the incidence of the tax upon its objects rather than the ultimate thrust of the economic benefits and burdens of transactions within the state. As a matter of convenience and certainty, and to secure a practically just operation of the constitutional prohibition, we look to the state power to control the objects of the tax as marking the boundaries of the power to lay it. Hence it is that a state which controls the property and activities within its boundaries of a foreign corporation admitted to do business there may tax them. But the due process clause denies to the state \n\n[303 \nU.S. 77, 81]\n\u00a0\n power to tax or regulate the corporation's property and activities elsewhere. Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194\n, 26 S. Ct. 36, 4 Ann.Cas. 493; New York Life Insurance Co. v. Head, \n234 \nU.S. 149\n, 34 S.Ct. 879; New York Life Insurance Co. v.

It follows that such a tax, otherwise unconstitutional, is not converted into a valid exaction merely because the corporation enjoys outside the state economic benefits from transactions within it, which the state might but does not tax, or because the state might tax the transactions which the corporation carries on outside the state if it were induced to carry them on within.\n Appellant, by its reinsurance contracts, undertook only to indemnify the insured companies against loss upon their policies written in California. The reinsurance involved no transactions or relationship between appellant and those originally insured, and called for no act in California. Connecticut General Life, insurance Co. v. Johnson, supra, 3 Cal.2d 83, 87, 43 P.2d 278; compare Morris & Co. v. Skandinavia Insurance Co., \n279 \nU.S. 405, 408\n, 49 S.Ct. 360, 361. Apart from the facts that appellant was privileged to do business in California, and that the risks reinsured were originally insured against in that state by companies also authorized to do business there, California had no relationship to appellant or to the reinsurance contracts. No act in the course of their formation, performance, or discharge, took place there. The performance of those acts was not dependent upon any privilege or authority granted by it, and California laws afforded to them no protection. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 77, 82]\n\u00a0\n The grant by the state of the privilege of doing business there and its consequent authority to tax the privilege do not withdraw from the protection of the due process clause the privilege, which California does not grant, of doing business elsewhere. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S.Ct. 190; International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 135\n, 38 S.Ct. 292, Ann.Cas.1918C, 617; Louisville & Jeffersonville Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, \n188 \nU.S. 385, 398\n, 23 S.Ct. 463. Even though a tax on the privilege of doing business within the state in insuring residents and risks within it may be measured by the premiums collected, including those mailed to the home office without the state, Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Pennsylvania, \n238 \nU.S. 143\n, 35 S.Ct. 829, and though the writing of policies without the state insuring residents and risks within it is taxable because within the granted privilege, Compania General de Tabacos v. Collector, supra, \n275 \nU.S. 87, 98\n, 48 S.Ct. 100, 104, there is no basis for saying that reinsurance which does not run to the original insured, and which from its inception to its termination involves no action taken within California, even the settlement and adjustment of claims, is embraced in any privilege granted by that state. Provident Savings Life Assurance Society v. Kentucky, supra, \n239 \nU.S. 103, 112\n, 36 S. Ct. 34, L.R.A.1916C, 572; Compania General de Tabacos v. Collector, supra, \n275 \nU.S. 87, 96\n, 48 S.Ct. 100, 103; compare Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Pennsylvania, supra, \n238 \nU.S. 143, 147\n, 35 S.Ct. 829; Compania General de Tabacos v. Collector, supra, \n275 \nU.S. 87, 98\n, 48 S.Ct. 100, 104. All that appellant did in effecting the reinsurance was done without the state and for its transaction no privilege or license by California was needful. The tax cannot be sustained either as laid on property, business done, or transactions carried on within the state, or as a tax on a privilege granted by the state.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 77, 83]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK (dissenting).\n I do not believe that this California corporate franchise tax has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt to be in violation of the Federal Constitution1 and I believe that the judgment of the Supreme Court of California should be affirmed. Traditionally, states have been empowered to grant or deny foreign corporations the right to do business within their borders,2 and 'may exclude them arbitrarily or impose such conditions as (they) will upon their engaging in business within (their) jurisdiction.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n California laid an annual tax upon gross insurance premiums which the Supreme Court of California, Consolidated Title Securities Co. v. Hopkins, 1 Cal.2d 414, 35 P.2d 320, 323, has construed to be 'a franchise tax exacted for the privilege of doing business.' In measuring this franchise tax imposed upon corporations the state includes reinsurance premiums paid to the corporation on contracts made without the state, where such reinsurance protects citizens of the State of California. There is no attempt by this tax to regulate the business of the insurance company in any state except California.\n The record does not indicate that California made any contract with this Connecticut corporation guaranteeing it a permanent franchise to do business in California on the same terms and conditions upon which it entered the state.\n'A state which freely granted the corporate privilege for intrastate commerce may change its policy. ... In the absence of contract, there is no vested interest which requires the continuance of a legislative policy however \n\n[303 \nU.S. 77, 84]\n\u00a0\n expressed-whether embodied in a charter or in a system of taxation.'4\n\n It may be that California believes that by this tax it can stimulate the reinsurance business of companies making their reinsurance contracts in California. The right of a state to foster its own domestic industries by its taxing system has been sustained by this Court. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n This Court has also frequently sustained the right of a state to impose conditions on foreign corporations in order to favor its own corporations. \n6\n If a state did not have this privilege it could not protect the domestic business of its own corporations from undesirable competiton by foreign corporations. The state of California has the constitutional right to limit the privileges of its own corporations and to reserve the right to control their privileges and to define and limit their activities. 7 If California has the lawful constitutional right (as this Court has many times said it has) to impose conditions upon foreign corporations so as to protect domestic corporations, its own elected legislative representatives should be the judges of what is reasonable and proper in a democracy.\n With reference to a corporate tax imposed by the state of Louisiana, this Court has said: 'The appellants, by incorporating in some other state, or by spreading their business and activities over other states, cannot set at naught the public policy of Louisiana (California?). ... The policy Louisiana (California?) is free to adopt with \n\n[303 \nU.S. 77, 85]\n\u00a0\n respect to the business activities of her own citizens she may apply to the citizens of other states who conduct the same business within her borders, and this irrespective of whether the evils requiring regulation arise solely from operations in Louisiana (California?) or are in part the result of extrastate transactions.' \n8\n\u00a0\n\n But it is contended that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits California from determining what terms and conditions should be imposed upon this Connecticut corporation to promote the welfare of the people of California.\n I do not believe the word 'person' in the Fourteenth Amendment includes corporations. 'The doctrine of stare decisis, however appropriate and even necessary at times, has only a limited application in the field of constitutional law.' \n9\n This Court has many times changed its interpretations of the Constitution when the conclusion was reached that an improper construction had been adopted. \n10\n Only recently the case of West Coast Hotel Company v. Parrish, \n300 \nU.S. 379\n, 57 S.Ct. 578, 108 A.L.R. 1330, expressly overruled a previous interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment which had long blocked state minimum wage legislation. When a statute is declared by this Court to be unconstitutional, the decision until reversed stands as a barrier against the adoption of similar legislation. A constitutional interpretation that is wrong should not stand. I believe this Court should now overrule previous decisions which interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment to include corporations.\n Neither the history nor the language of the Fourteenth Amendment justifies the belief that corporations are in- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 77, 86]\n\u00a0\n cluded within its protection. The historical purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was clearly set forth when first considered by this Court in the Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, decided April, 1873-less than five years after the proclamation of its adoption. Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the Court, said:\n'Among the first acts of legislation adopted by several of the States in the legislative bodies which claimed to be in their normal relaions with the Federal government, were laws which imposed upon the colored race onerous disabilities and burdens, and curtailed their rights in the pursuit of life, liberty, and property to such an extent that their freedom was of little value, while they had lost the protection which they had received from their former owners from motives both of interest and humanity. ...\n\n'These circumstances, whatever of falsehood or misconception may have been mingled with their presentation, forced ... the conviction that something more was necessary in the way of constitutional protection to the unfortunate race who had suffered so much. (Congressional leaders) accordingly passed through Congress the proposition for the fourteenth amendment, and ... declined to treat as restored to their full participation in the government of the Union the States which had been in insurrection, until they ratified that article by a formal vote of their legislative bodies.' 16 Wall. 36, at page 70.\n\n Certainly, when the Fourteenth Amendment was submitted for approval, the people were not told that the states of the South were to be denied their normal relationship with the Federal Government unless they ratified an amendment granting new and revolutionary rights to corporations. This Court, when the Slaughter House Cases were decided in 1873, had apparnetly discovered no such purpose. The records of the time can be searched in vain for evidence that this amendment was adopted for the benefit of corporations. It is true \n\n[303 \nU.S. 77, 87]\n\u00a0\n that in 1882, twelve years after its adoption, and ten years after the Slaughter House Cases, supra, an argument was made in this Court that a journal of the joint Congressional Committee which framed the amendment, secret and undisclosed up to that date, indicated the committee's desire to protect corporations by the use of the word 'person.' \n11\n Four years later, in 1886, this Court in the case of Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad, \n118 \nU.S. 394\n, 6 S.Ct. 1132, decided for the first time that the word 'person' in the amendment did in some instances include corporations. A secret purpose on the part of the members of the committee, even if such be the fact, however, would not be sufficient to justify any such construction. The history of the amendment proves that the people were told that its purpose was to protect weak and helpless human beings and were not told that it was intended to remove corporations in any fashion from the control of state governments. The Fourteenth Amendment followed the freedom of a race from slavery. Jusice Swayne said in the Slaughter Houses Cases, supra, that: 'By 'any person' was meant all persons within the jurisdiction of the State. No distinction is intimated on account of race or color.' Corporations have neither race nor color. He knew the amendment was intended to protect the life, liberty, and property of human beings.\n The language of the amendment itself does not support the theory that it was passed for the benefit of corporations.\n The first clause of section 1 of the amendment reads: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and sub- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 77, 88]\n\u00a0\n ject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' Certainly a corporation cannot be naturalized and 'persons' here is not broad enough to include 'corporations.'\n The first clause of the second sentence of section 1 reads: 'No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.' While efforts have been made to persuade this Court to allow corporations to claim the protection of his clause, these efforts have not been successful. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n The next clause of the second sentence reads: 'Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' It has not been decided that this clause prohibits a state from depriving a corporation of 'life.' This Court has expressly held that 'the liberty guaranteed by the 14th Amendment against deprivation without due process of law is the liberty of natural, not artificial persons.' \n13\n Thus, the words 'life' and 'liberty' do not apply to corporations, and of course they could not have been so intended to apply. However, the decisions of this Court which the majority follow hold that corporations are included in this clause in so far as the word 'property' is concerned. In other words, this clause is construed to mean as follows:\n'Nor shall any State deprive any human being of life, liberty or property without due process of law; nor shall any State deprive any corporation of property without due process of law.'\n\n The last clause of this second sentence of section 1 reads: 'Nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal prtoection of the laws.' As used here, 'person' has been construed to include corporations. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 77, 89]\n\u00a0\n Both Congress and the people were familiar with the meaning of the word 'corporation' at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was submitted and adopted. The judicial inclusion of the word 'corporation' in the Fourteenth Amendment has had a revolutionary effect on our form of government. The states did not adopt the amendment with knowledge of its sweeping meaning under its present construction. No section of the amendment gave notice to the people that, if adopted, it would subject every state law and municipal ordinance, affecting corporations, (and all administrative actions under them) to censorship of the United States courts. No word in all this amendment gave any hint that its adoption would deprive the states of their long-recognized power to regulate corporations.\n The second section of the amendment informed the people that representatives would be apportioned among the several states 'according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.' No citizen could gather the impression here that while the word 'persons' in the second section applied to human beings, the word 'persons' in the first section in some instances applied to corporations. Section 3 of the amendment said that 'no person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress,' (who 'engaged in insurrection'). There was no intimation here that the word 'person' in the first section in some instances included corporations.\n This amendment sought to prevent discrimination by the states against classes or races. We are aware of this from words spoken in this Court within five years after its adoption, when the people and the courts were personally familiar with the historical background of the amendment. 'We doubt very much whether any action of a State not directed by way of discrimination against \n\n[303 \nU.S. 77, 90]\n\u00a0\n the negroes as a class, or on account of their race, will ever be held to come within the purview of this provision.' \n15\n Yet, of the cases in this Court in which the Fourteenth Amendment was applied during the first fifty years after its adoption, less than one-half of 1 per cent. invoked it in protection of the negro race, and more than 50 per cent. asked that its benefits be extended to corporations. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n If the people of this nation wish to deprive the states of their sovereign rights to determine what is a fair and just tax upon corporations doing a purely local business within their own state boundaries, there is a way provided by the Constitution to accomplish this purpose. That way does not lie along the course of judicial amendment to that fundamental charter. An amendment having that purpose could be submitted by Congress as provided by the Constitution. I do not believe that the Fourteenth Amendment had that purpose, nor that the people believed it had that purpose, nor that it should be construed as having that purpose.\n I believe the judgment of the Supreme Court of California should be sustained. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cf.

Boudin, of New York City, for respondent-intervener United Electrical and Radio Workers of America.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United Electrical and Radio Workers of America, affiliated with the Committee for Industrial Organization, filed a charge, on May 5, 1937, with the National Labor Relations Board that the Consolidated Edison Company of New York and its affiliated companies were interfering with the right of their employees to form, join or assist labor organizations of their own choosing and were contributing financial and other support, in the manner described, to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor. The Board issued its complaint and the employing companies, appearing specially, challenged its jurisdiction. On the denial of their request that this question be determined initially, the companies filed answers reserving their jurisdictional objections. After the taking of evidence before a trial examiner, the proceeding was transferred to the Board which on November 10, 1937, made its findings and order.\n The order directed the companies to desist from labor practices found to be unfair and in violation of Section 8(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act,1 directed reinstatement of six discharged employees with back pay, and required the posting of notices to the effect that the companies would cease the described practices and that their employees were free to join or assist any labor or- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 218]\n\u00a0\n ganization for the purpose of collective bargaining and would not be subject to discharge or to any discrimination by reason of their choice. 4 N.L.R.B. 71.\n It appeared that between May 28, 1937, and June 16, 1937, the companies had entered into agreements with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and its local unions, providing for the recognition of the Brotherhood as the collective bargaining agency for those employees who were its members, and containing various stipulations as to hours, working conditions, wages, etc., and for arbitration in the event of disputes. The Board found that these contracts were executed under such circumstances that they were invalid and required the companies to desist from giving them effect. Id. At the same time the Board decided that the companies had not engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of Section 8(2) of the Act. \n2\n That clause makes it an unfair labor practice to 'dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute financial or other support to it'. Accordingly the order dismissed the complaint, so far as it alleged a violation of Section 8(2), without prejudice. Id.\n The companies petitioned the Circuit Court of Appeals to set aside the order and a petition for the same purpose was presented by the Brotherhood and its locals. These labor organizations had not been parties to the proceeding before the Board but intervened in the Circuit Court of Appeals as parties aggrieved by the invalidation of their contracts. The Board in turn asked the court to enforce the order. The United Electrical and Radio Workers of America appeared in support of the Board. The court granted the Board's petition. 2 Cir., 95 F.2d 390. We issued writs of certiorari upon applications of the companies (No. 19) and of the Brotherhood and its locals (No. 25). \n304 \nU.S. 555\n, 58 S.Ct. 1038; \n304 \nU.S. 555\n, 58 S.Ct. 1041, May 16, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 219]\n\u00a0\n The questions presented relate (1) to the jurisdiction of the Board; ( 2) to the fairness of the hearing; (3) to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the findings of the Board with respect to coercive practices, discrimination and the discharge of employees; and (4) to the invalidation of the contracts with the Brotherhood and its locals.\n The pertinent facts will be considered in connection with our discussion of these questions.\n First.-The jurisdiction of the Board.-That is, was the proceeding within the scope of its authority validly conferred? The petitioning companies constitute an integrated system. With the exception of one company which maintains underground ducts for electrical conductors in New York City, they are all public utilities engaged in supplying electric energy, gas and steam (and certain by-products) within that City and adjacent Westchester County. The enterprise is one of great magnitude. The companies serve over 3,500,000 electric and gas customers,-a large majority using the service for residential and domestic purposes. In 1936 the companies supplied about 97.5 per cent. of the total electric energy sold in the City of New York and about one hundred per cent. of that sold in Westchester County. They do not sell for resale without the State. They have about 42,000 employees, their total payrolls in 1936, with retirement annuities and separation allowances, amounting to nearly $82,000,000.\n Petitioners urge that these predominant intrastate activities, carried on under the plenary control of the State of New York in the exercise of its police power, are not subject to federal authority. It does not follow, however, because these operations of the utilities are of vast concern to the people of the City and State of New York, that they do not also involve the interests of interstate and foreign commerce in such a degree that the Federal \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 220]\n\u00a0\n Government was entitled to intervene for their protection. For example, the governance of the intrastate rates of a railroad company may be of great importance to the State and an appropriate object of the exertion of its power, but the Federal Government may still intervene to protect interstate commerce from injury caused by intrastate operations and to that end may override intrastate rates and supply a dominant federal rule. The Shreveport Case, Houston, E. & W.T. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S.Ct. 833; Wisconsin Railroad Commission v. Chicago, B. & Q. Ry. Co.,\n257 \nU.S. 563\n, 42 S.Ct. 232, 22 A.L.R. 1086; New York v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 591\n, 42 S.Ct. 239. See, also, National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 37-41, 57 S.Ct. 615, 624-626, 108 A.L.R. 1352.\n In the present instance we may lay on one side, as did the Circuit Court of Appeals, the mere purchases by the utilities of the supplies of oil, coal, etc., although very large, which come from without the State and are consumed in the generation and distribution of electric energy and gas. Apart from those purchases, there is undisputed and impressive evidence of the dependence of interstate and foreign commerce upon the continuity of the service of the petitioning companies. They supply electric energy to the New York Central Railroad Company, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company, and the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Company (operating a tunnel service to New Jersey) for the lighting and operation of passenger and freight terminals, and for the movement of interstate trains. They supply the Port of New York Authority with electric energy for the operation of its terminal and the Holland Tunnel. They supply a majority of the piers of trans-Atlantic and coastal steamship companies along the North and East Rivers, within the City of New York, for lighting, freight handling and related uses. They serve the Western Union Telegraph Company, the Postal Telegraph Company, and the New York Telephone Com- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 221]\n\u00a0\n pany with power for transmitting and receiving messages, local and interstate. They supply electric energy for the trans-Atlantic radio service of the Radio Corporation of America. They provide electric energy for the Floyd Bennett Air Field in Brooklyn for various purposes, including field illumination, a radio beam and obstruction lighting. Under contracts with the Federal Government they supply electric energy for six lighthouses and eight beacon or harbor lights; also light, heat and power for the general post office and branch post offices, the United States Barge Office, the Customs House, appraisers' warehouse and various federal office buildings.\n It cannot be doubted that these activities, while conducted within the State, are matters of federal concern. In their totality they rise to such a degree of importance that the fact that they involve but a small part of the entire service rendered by the utilities in their extensive business is immaterial in the consideration of the existence of the federal protective power. The effect upon interstate and foreign commerce of an interruption through industrial strife of the service of the petitioning companies was vividly described by the Circuit Court of Appeals in these words: 'Instantly, the terminals and trains of three great interstate railroads would cease to operate; interstate communication by telegraph, telephone, and radio would stop; lights maintained as aids to navigation would go out; and the business of interstate ferries and of foreign steamships, whose docks are lighted and operated by electric energy, would be greatly impeded. Such effects we cannot regard as indirect and remote'. 2 Cir., 95 F.2d 390, 394.\n If industrial strife due to unfair labor practices actually brought about such a catastrophe, we suppose that no one would question the authority of the Federal Government to intervene in order to facilitate the settlement of the dispute and the resumption of the essential service to inter- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 222]\n\u00a0\n state and foreign commerce. But it cannot be maintained that the exertion of federal power must await the disruption of that commerce. Congress was entitled to provide reasonable preventive measures and that was the object of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq.\n Congress did not attempt to deal with particular instances. It created for that purpose the National Labor Relations Board. In conferring authority upon that Board, Congress had regard to the limitations of the constitutional grant of federal power. Thus, the 'commerce' contemplated by the Act (aside from that within a Territory or the District of Columbia) is interstate and foreign commerce. The unfair labor practices which the Act purports to reach are those affecting that commerce. Section 10(a).3 In determining the constitutional bounds of the authority conferred, we have applied the well-settled principle that it is the effect upon interstate or foreign commerce, not the source of the injury, which is the criterion. It is not necessary to repeat what we said upon this point in the review of our decisions in the case of National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, supra. And whether or not particular action in the conduct of intrastate enterprises does affect that commerce is such a close and intimate fashion as to be subject to federal control, is left to be determined as individual cases arise. Id., see, also, Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n303 \nU.S. 453, 466\n, 467 S., 58 S.Ct. 656, 660, 661.\n Petitioners urge that the legislature of New York has enacted comprehensive and adequate measures to protect against the interruption of petitioners' services through labor disputes. Not only has the State long had legislation relating to the operations of public utility companies ( Public Service Law, Consol.Laws, c. 48) but the legislature has recently enacted the New York State Labor Relations \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 223]\n\u00a0\n Act (Laws of 1937, Chapter 443, effective July 1, 1937; Article 20 of the Labor Law, Consol.Laws, c. 31,  700 et seq.) which provides a complete supervision of labor relations for employers in intrastate enterprises similar to that set up by the National Labor Relations Act with respect to interstate or foreign commerce. The state act, with added details, follows closely the national act. The state act provides for collective bargaining, including the conduct of elections to determine the representation of employees, and empowers the state Labor Relations Board to prevent unfair labor practices. In seeking to avoid a clash with federal authority, the state act is made inapplicable 'to the employees of any employer who concedes to and agrees with the board that such employees are subject to and protected by the provisions of the national labor relations act or the federal railway labor act'.4 It is manifest that the enactment of this state law could not override the constitutional authority of the Federal Government. The State could not add to or detract from that authority. But it is also true that where the employers are not themselves engaged in interstate or foreign commerce, and the authority of the National Labor Relations Board is invoked to protect that commerce from interference or injury arising from the employers' intrastate activities, the question whether the alleged unfair labor practices do actually threaten interstate or foreign commerce in a substantial manner is necessary presented. And in determining that factual question regard should be had to all the existing circumstances including the bearing and effect of any protective action to the same end already taken under state authority. The justification for the exercise of federal power should clearly appear. Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 211\n, 212 S., 51 S.Ct. 119, 123, 124. But the question in such a case would relate not to the existence of the federal \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 224]\n\u00a0\n power but to the propriety of its exercise on a given state of facts.\n In the instant case, not only was this proceeding instituted before the New York Labor Relations Act became effective but, so far as appears, no proceedings have been taken under it in relation to the unfair labor practices here alleged. For the present purpose, it is sufficient to say that there has been no exertion of state authority which can be taken to remove the need for the exertion of federal authority to protect interstate and foreign commerce. The exercise of the federal power to protect interstate and foreign commerce from injury does not depend upon a clash with state action and need not await the exercise of state authority.\n We conclude that the Board had authority to entertain this proceeding against the petitioning companies.\n Second.-The fairness of the hearing,-procedural due process. Apart from the action of the Board with respect to the Brotherhood contracts, which we shall consider separately, the contentions under this head relate ( 1) to amendments of the complaint, (2) to the refusal to hear certain witnesses, and (3) to the transfer of the proceeding to the Board and its determination without an intermediate report or opportunity for hearing upon proposed findings.\n The original complaint related to the discharge of five employees and alleged unfair labor practices in the employment of industrial spies and undercover operatives, in allowing employees to solicit membership in the Brotherhood during working hours and on the property of the companies, in compensating such employees while so engaged and in furnishing them office space and financial assistance while refusing such privileges to the United, and generally in coercion of the employees to join the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 225]\n\u00a0\n Brotherhood. The amendments were made from time to time in the course of the hearing. In particular, they added another employee to those alleged to have been wrongfully discharged and supplied an omitted allegation that the other unfair labor practices affected commerce. At the close of the evidence the trial examiner granted a motion to conform the pleadings to the proof on the statement of the attorney for the Board that no important change was intended and that the amendment was sought merely to make more definite and certain what appeared in the complaint. These were discretionary rulings which afford no ground for challenging the validity of the hearing.\n A more serious question grows out of the refusal to receive the testimony of certain witnesses. The taking of evidence began on June 3, 1937, and was continued from time to time until June 23d when the attorney for the Board unexpectedly announced that its case would probably be closed on the following day. At that time the Board completed its proof, with the reservation of one matter, and at the request of the companies' counsel the hearing was adjourned until July 6th in order that Mr. Carlisle, the chairman of the board of trustees of the Consolidated Edison Company, and Mr. Dean, the vice president of one of its affiliates, who were then unavailable, could testify. In response to the examiner's inquiry, the companies' counsel stated that the direct examination of all witnesses on their behalf would not occupy more than a day. On July 6th the testimony of Mr. Carlisle and Mr. Dean was taken and the companies also offered the testimony of two other witnesses (then present in the hearing room) in relation to the discharge of the employee with respect to whom the complaint had been amended as above stated. The examiner refused to receive this testimony following a ruling of the Board (made in the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 226]\n\u00a0\n course of correspondence with the companies' counsel during the adjournment) to the effect that no other testimony than that of Mr. Carlisle and Mr. Dean would be received on the adjourned day. An offer of proof was made which showed the testimony to be highly important with respect to the reasons for the discharge. It was brief and could have been received at once without any undue delay in the closing of the hearing.\n We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the refusal to receive the testimony was unreasonable and arbitrary. Assuming, as the Board contends, that it had a discretionary control over the conduct of the proceeding, we cannot but regard this action as an abuse of discretion. But the statute did not leave the petitioners without remedy. The court below pointed to that remedy, that is, to apply to the Circuit Court of Appeals for leave to adduce the additional evidence; on such an application and a showing of reasonable grounds the court could have ordered it to be taken. Section 10(e)(f).5 Petitioners did not avail themselves of this appropriate procedure.\n Shortly after the evidence was closed, the counsel for the petitioning companies filed a brief with the trial examiner. Several weeks later, on September 29th, the proceeding was transferred to the Board. The examiner made no tentative report or findings and there was no opportunity for a hearing before the Board itself. It must be assumed, however, that the brief for the companies was transmitted to the Board and was considered by it in making its decision. The Board contends that the companies submitted their brief without asking for an oral argument, as contemplated by the Board's rule (Rule 29), or for an intermediate report, and hence that they are not in a position to complaint on either score. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 227]\n\u00a0\n The Board also insists that after the transfer of the proceeding, it was within the discretion of the Board to adopt any one of the courses of procedure enumerated in its rule (Rule 38)6 of which petitioners were informed by the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 228]\n\u00a0\n service of a copy of the Board's rules at the beginning of the proceeding. Petitioners say that at the very outset they had asked, on their special appearance, for a hearing before the Board upon the question of its jurisdiction and that all proceedings be transferred to the Board, and that the rules induced the belief that after the transfer to the Board at the close of the evidence there would be further proceedings at which they would be heard. But we cannot say that the rules justified that expectation or dispensed with the necessity, after the transfer, of a suitable request by the petitioners for such additional hearing as they desired. It does not appear that such request was made.\n It cannot be said that the Board did not consider the evidence or the petitioners' brief or failed to make its own findings in the light of that evidence and argument. It would have been better practice for the Board to have directed the examiner to make a tentative report with an opportunity for exceptions and argument thereon. But, aside from the question of the Brotherhood contracts, we find no basis for concluding that the issues and contentions were not clearly defined and that the petitioning companies were not fully advised of them. National Labor Relations Board v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co., \n304 \nU.S. 333, 350\n, 351 S., 58 S.Ct. 904, 912, 913. The points raised as to the lack \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 229]\n\u00a0\n of procedural due process in this relation cannot be sustained.\n Third.-The sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the findings of the Board with respect to coercive practices, discrimination and discharge of employees.-The companies contend that the Court of Appeals misconceived its power to review the findings and, instead of searching the record to see if they were sustained by 'substantial' evidence, merely considered whether the record was 'wholly barren of evidence' to support them. We agree that the statute, in providing that 'the findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive', section 10(e), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(e), means supported by substantial evidence. Washington, Virginia & Maryland Coach Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n301 \nU.S. 142, 147\n, 57 S.Ct. 648, 650. Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Appalachian Electric Power Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 4 Cir., 93 F.2d 985, 989; National Labor Relations Board v. Thompson Products, 6 Cir., 97 F.2d 13, 15; Ballston-Stillwater Knitting Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 2 Cir., 98 F.2d 758, 760. We do not think that the Circuit Court of Appeals intended to apply a different test. In saying that the record was not 'wholly barren of evidence' to sustain the finding of discrimination, we think that the court referred to substantial evidence. Ballston- Stillwater Knitting Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra.\n The companies urge that the Board received 'remote hearsay' and 'mere rumor'. The statute provides that 'the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law and equity shall not be controlling'.7 The obvious purpose of this and similar provisions is to free administrative \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 230]\n\u00a0\n boards from the compulsion of technical rules so that the mere admission of matter which would be deemed incompetent in judicial proceedings would not invalidate the administrative order. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baird, \n194 \nU.S. 25, 44\n, 24 S.Ct. 563, 568; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 93\n, 33 S.Ct. 185, 187; United States v. Abilene & Southern Ry. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 288\n, 44 S.Ct. 565, 569; Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420, 442\n, 50 S.Ct. 220, 225. But this assurance of a desirable flexibility in administrative procedure does not go so far as to justify orders without a basis in evidence having rational probative force. Mere uncorroborated hearsay or rumor does not constitute substantial evidence.\n Applying these principles, we are unable to conclude that the Board's findings in relation to the matters now under consideration did not have the requisite foundation. With respect to industrial espionage, the companies say that the employment of 'outside investigating agencies' of any sort had been voluntarily discontinued prior to November, 1936, but the Board rightly urges that it was entitled to bar its resumption. Compare Federal Trade Commission v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., \n304 \nU.S. 257, 260\n, 58 S.Ct. 863, 864. In relation to the other charges of unfair labor practices, the companies point to the statement of Mr. Carlisle at a large meeting of the employees in April, 1937, when the recognition of the Brotherhood was under discussion, that the employees were absolutely free to join any labor organization,-that they could do as they pleased. Despite this statement and assuming, as counsel for the companies urges, that where two independent labor organizations seek recognition it cannot be said to be an unfair labor practice for the employer merely to express preference of one organization over the other, by reason of the former's announced policies, in the absence of any attempts at intimidation or coercion, we think that there was still substantial evidence that such attempts were made in this case. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 231]\n\u00a0\n It would serve no useful purpose to lengthen this opinion by detailing the testimony. We are satisfied that the provisions of the order requiring the companies to desist from the discriminating and coercive practices described in subdivisions (a) to (e) inclusive and in subdivision (h) of paragraph one of its order,8 and to reinstate the six employees mentioned with back pay, and to post notices assuring freedom from discrimination and coercion as provided in paragraph two of the order, rested upon findings sustained by the evidence and that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals enforcing the order in these respects should be affirmed.\n Fourth.-The Brotherhood contracts.-The findings of the Board that the contracts with the Brotherhood and its locals were invalid, and the Board's order requiring the companies to desist from giving effect to these contracts, present questions of major importance. We approach them in the light of three cardinal considerations. One is that the Brotherhood and its locals are labor organi- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 232]\n\u00a0\n zations independently established as affiliates of the American Federation of Labor and are not under the control of the employing companies. So far as there was any charge, under Section 8(2) of the Act, that the employing companies had dominated or interfered with the formation or administration of any labor organization or had contributed financial or other support to it, the charge was dismissed. Another consideration is that the contracts recognize the right of employees to bargain collectively; they recognize the Brotherhood as the collective bargaining agency for the employees who belong to it, and the Brotherhood agrees for itself and its members not to intimidate or coerce employees into membership in the Brotherhood and not to solicit membership on the time or property of the employers. The third consideration is that the contracts contain important provisions with regard to hours, working conditions, wages, sickness, disability, etc., and also provide against strikes or lockouts and for the adjustment and arbitration of labor disputes, thus constituting insuance against the disruption of the service of the companies to interstate or foreign commerce through an outbreak of industrial strife. It is not contended that these provisions are unreasonable or oppressive but on the contrary it was virtually conceded at the bar that they are fair to both the employers and employees. It also appears from the evidence, which was received without objection, that the Brotherhood and its locals comprised over 30,000, or 80 per cent of the companies' employees out of 38,000 eligible for membership.\n The Brotherhood and its locals contend that they were indispensable parties and that in the absence of legal notice to them or their appearance, the Board had no authority to invalidate the contracts. The Board contests this position, invoking our decision in National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, 303 \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 233]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 261, 58 S.Ct. 571, 115 A.L.R. 307. That case, however, is not apposite, as there no question of contract between employer and employee was involved. The Board had found upon evidence that the employer had created and fostered the labor organization in question and dominated its administration in violation of Section 8(2). The statement that the 'Association' so formed and controlled was not entitled to notice and hearing was made in that relation. Pages 262, 270, 271, 58 S.Ct. pages 572, 576. It has no application to independent labor unions such as those before us. We think that the Brotherhood and its locals having valuable and beneficial interests in the contracts were entitled to notice and hearing before they could be set aside. Russell v. Clark's Executors, 7 Cranch 69, 96; Mallow v. Hinde, 12 Wheat. 193, 198; Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., \n184 \nU.S. 199, 235\n, 22 S.Ct. 308, 322; Garzot v. Rios de Rubio, \n209 \nU.S. 283, 297\n, 28 S.Ct. 548, 554; General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & M. R. Railway Co., \n260 \nU.S. 261, 285\n, 43 S.Ct. 106, 116. The rule, which was applied in the cases cited to suits in equity, is not of a technical character but rests upon the plainest principle of justice, equally applicable here. See Mallow v. Hinde, supra.\n The Board urges that the National Labor Relations Act does not contain any provision requiring these unions to be made parties; that Section 10(b)9 authorizes the Board to serve a complaint only upon persons charged with unfair labor practices and that only employers can be so charged. In that view, the question would at once arise whether the Act could be construed as authorizing the Board to invalidate the contracts of independent labor unions not before it and also as to the validity of the Act if so construed. But the Board contends that the Brotherhood had notice, referring to the service of a copy of the complaint and notice of hearing upon a local union of the Brotherhood on May 12, 1937, and of an amended notice of hear- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 234]\n\u00a0\n ing on May 25, 1937. Petitioners rejoin that the service was not upon a local whose rights were affected but upon one whose members were not employees of the companies' system. The Board says, however, that the Brotherhood, and the locals which were involved, had actual notice and hence were entitled to intervene (Sec. 10(b) and chose not to do so. But neither the original complaint-which antedated the contracts-nor the subsequent amendments contained any mention of them and the Brotherhood and its locals were not put upon notice that the validity of the contracts was under attack. The Board contends that the complaint challenged the legality of the companies' 'relations' with the Brotherhood. But what was thus challenged cannot be regarded as going beyond the particular practices of the employers and the discharges which the complaint described. In these circumstances it cannot be said that the unions were under a duty to intervene before the Board in order to safeguard their interests.\n The Board urges further that the unions have availed themselves of the opportunity to petition for review of the Board's order in the Circuit Court of Appeals, and that due process does not require an opportunity to be heard before judgment, if defenses may be presented upon appeal. York v. Texas, \n137 \nU.S. 15, 20\n, 21 S., 11 S.Ct. 9, 10; American Surety Company v. Baldwin, \n287 \nU.S. 156, 168\n, 53 S.Ct. 98, 102, 86 A.L.R. 298; Moore Ice Cream Company v. Rose, \n289 \nU.S. 373, 384\n, 56 S.Ct. 620, 624. But this rule assumes that the appellate review does afford opportunity to present all available defenses including lack of proper notice to justify the judgment or order complained of. Id.\n Apart from this question of notice to the unions, both the companies and the unions contend that upon the case made before the Board it had no authority to invalidate the contracts. Both insist that that issue was not actually litigated, and the record supports that contention. The argument to the contrary, that the con- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 235]\n\u00a0\n tracts were necessarily in issue because of the charge of unfair labor practices against the companies, is without substance. Not only did the complaint as amended fail to assail the contracts but it was stated by the attorney for the Board upon the hearing that the complaint was not directed against the Brotherhood; that 'no issue of representation (was) involved in this proceeding'; and that the Board took the position that the Brotherhood was 'a bona fide labor organization' whose legality was not attacked. But the Board says that on July 6th (the last of the contracts having been made on June 16th) the companies amended their answer stating that the making of the contracts had rendered the proceeding moot, and that this necessarily put the contracts in issue. We cannot so regard it. We think that the fair construction of the position thus taken on the last day of the hearings was entirely consistent with the view that the validity of the contracts had not been, and was not, in issue. And the counsel for the companies point to their brief before the Board, which they produce, as proceeding on the basis that the validity of the contracts had not been assailed.\n Further, the Act gives no express authority to the Board to invalidate contracts with independent labor organizations. That authority, if it exists, must rest upon the provisions of Section 10(c).10 That section authorizes the Board, when it has found the employer guilty of unfair labor practices, to require him to desist from such practices 'and to take such affirmative action, including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this Act (chapter)' . We think that this authority to order affirmative action does not go so far as to confer a punitive jurisdiction enabling the Board to inflict upon the employer any penalty it may choose \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 236]\n\u00a0\n because he is engaged in unfair labor practices, even though the Board be of the opinion that the policies of the Act might be effectuated by such anorder.\n The power to command affirmative action is remedial, not punitive, and is to be exercised in aid of the Board's authority to restrain violations and as a means of removing or avoiding the consequences of violation where those consequences are of a kind to thwart the purposes of the Act. The continued existence of a company union established by unfair labor practices or of a union dominated by the employer is a consequence or violation of the Act whose continuance thwarts the purposes of the Act and renders ineffective any order restraining the unfair practices. Compare National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, supra. Here, there is no basis for a finding that the contracts with the Brotherhood and its locals were a consequence of the unfair labor practices found by the Board or that these contracts in themselves thwart any policy of the Act or that their cancellation would in any way make the order to cease the specified practices any more effective.\n The Act contemplates the making of contracts with labor organizations. That is the manifest objective in providing for collective bargaining. Under Section 711 the employees of the companies are entitled to self- organization, to join labor organizations and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing. The 80 per cent of the employees who were members of the Brotherhood and its locals, had that right. They had the right to choose the Brotherhood as their representative for collective bargaining and to have contracts made as the result of that bargaining. Nothing that the employers had done deprived them of that right. Nor did the contracts make the Brotherhood and its locals exclusive repre- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 237]\n\u00a0\n sentatives for collective bargaining. On this point the contracts speak for themselves. They simply constitute the Brotherhood the collective bargaining agency for those employees who are its members. The Board by its order did not direct an election to ascertain who should represent the employees for collective bargaining. Section 9(c).12 Upon this record, there is nothing to show that the employees' selection as indicated by the Brotherhood contracts has been superseded by any other selection by a majority of employees of the companies so as to create an exclusive agency for bargaining under the statute, and in the absence of such an exclusive agency the employees represented by the Brotherhood, even if they were a minority, clearly had the right to make their own choice. Moreover, the fundamental purpose of the Act is to protect interstate and foreign commerce from interruptions and obstructions caused by industrial strife. This purpose appears to be served by these contracts in an important degree. Representing such a large percentage of the employees of the companies, and precluding strikes and providing for the arbitration of disputes, these agreements are highly protective to interstate and foreign commerce. They contain no terms which can be said to 'affect commerce' in the sense of the Act so as to justify their abrogation by the Board. The disruption of these contracts, even pending proceedings to ascertain by an election the wishes of the majority of employees, would remove that salutary protection during the intervening period.\n The Board insists that the contracts are invalid because made during the pendency of the proceeding. But the effect of that pendency would appropriately extend to the practices of the employers to which the complaint was addressed. See Jones v. Securities and Exchange Commission, \n298 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 56 S.Ct. 654, 657. It did not reach so far as to suspend \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 238]\n\u00a0\n the right of the employees to self-organization or preclude the Brotherhood as an independent organization chosen by its members from making fair contracts on their behalf.\n Apart from this, the main contention of the Board is that the contracts were the fruit of the unfair labor practices of the employers; that they were 'simply a device to consummate and perpetuate' the companies' illegal conduct and constituted its culmination. But, as we have said, this conclusion is entirely too broad to be sustained. If the Board intended to make that charge, it should have amended its complaint accordingly, given notice to the Brotherhood, and introduced proof to sustain the charge. Instead it is left as a matter of mere conjecture to what extent membership in the Brotherhood was induced by any illegal conduct on the part of the employers. The Brotherhood was entitled to form its locals and their organization was not assailed. The Brotherhood and its locals were entitled to solicit members and the employees were entitled to join. These rights cannot be brushed aside as immaterial for they are of the very essence of the rights which the Labor Relations Act was passed to protect and the Board could not ignore or override them in professing to effectuate the policies of the Act. To say that of the 30, 000 who did join there were not those who joined voluntarily or that the Brotherhood did not have members whom it could properly represent in making these contracts would be to indulge an extravagant and unwarranted assumption. The employers' practices, which were complained of, could be stopped without imperiling the interests of those who for all that appears had exercised freely their right of choice.\n We conclude that the Board was without authority to require the petitioning companies to desist from giving effect to the Brotherhood contracts, as provided in subdivision (f) of paragraph one of the Board's order. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 239]\n\u00a0\n Subdivision (g) of that paragraph, requiring the companies to cease recognizing the Brotherhood 'as the exclusive representative of their employees' stands on a different footing. The contracts do not claim for the Brotherhood exclusive representation of the companies' employees but only representation of those who are its members, and the continued operation of the contracts is necessarily subject to the provision of the law by which representatives of the employees for the purpose of collective bargaining can be ascertained in case any question of 'representation' should arise. Section 9.13 We construe subdivision (g) as having no more effect than to provide that there shall be no interference with an exclusive bargaining agency if one other than the Brotherhood should be established in accordance with the provisions of the Act. So construed, that subdivision merely applies existing law.\n The provision of paragraph two of the order as to posting notices should be modified so as to exclude any requirement to post a notice that the existing Brotherhood contracts have been abrogated.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is modified so as to hold unenforceable the provision of subdivision (f) of paragraph one of the order and the application to that provision of paragraph two subdivision ( c), and as so modified the decree enforcing the order of the Board is affirmed. It is so ordered.\n Decree modified and, as modified, affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER.\n I agree with the Court's decision that the Board was without authority to require employers to cease and desist from giving effect to the contracts referred to in \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 240]\n\u00a0\n subdivision (f) of the first paragraph of the order. And I am of opinion that the entire order should be set aside.\n The Board was without jurisdiction. The facts on which it assumed to exert power need not be narrated; they are sufficiently stated by the lower court and in the opinion here. Both courts rightly treat the case as one where neither employers nor employees are engaged in interstate or foreign commerce. Here, the employers are engaged solely in intrastate activities. A very small percentage of the products, furnished in that State to others, is by the latter used in interstate commerce. This Court has held that Congress cannot regulate relations between employers and employees engaged exclusively in intrastate activities.\n In Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, May 1935, \n295 \nU.S. 495\n, 55 S.Ct. 837, 97 A.L.R. 947, decided shortly before passage of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., we held that the federal government cannot regulate the wages and hours of labor of persons employed in the internal commerce of the State.\n In Carter v. Carter Coal Co., May 1936, \n298 \nU.S. 238\n, 56 S.Ct. 855, decided shortly after passage of the National Labor Relations Act, we held that provisions of the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935 looking to the control of wages, hours, and working conditions of persons engaged in producing coal about to move in interstate commerce and seeking to guarantee their right of collective bargaining, were beyond the power of Congress, for the reasons that it has no general power of regulation to promote the general welfare; that the power to regulate commerce does not include the power to control the conditions in which coal is produced; that the effect upon interstate commerce of labor conditions involved in the production of coal, including disputes and strikes over wages and working conditions, is indirect.\n In the period, less than a year, intervening between the Carter Case and National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., April 1937, \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 108 A.L.R. 1352, and other Labor Board Cases \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 241]\n\u00a0\n decided on the same day,1-and, as I think, wrongly decided-it was, on the authority of the Schechter and Carter Cases, held by four circuit courts of appeals and six district courts that the power of Congress does not extend to regulations between employers and their employees engaged in local production. Their decisions are cited in the dissenting opinion in the Labor Board Cases. 301 U.S. page 76, 57 S.Ct. page 630. In that period the lower courts were bound by our decisions to condemn the National Labor Relations Act, construed to apply to production or intrastate commerce, as not within the power of Congress.\n This case is not distinguishable from the Schechter Case or the Carter Case. There, as here, the activities of the employers and their employees were exclusively local. It differs from the Jones & Laughlin Case and all the other Labor Board Cases. \n2\n In each of them, the employer was to an extent engaged in interstate commerce. The opinion just announced points to no distinction between this case and the Schechter or Carter Case. Nor does it refer to the Labor Board Cases as controlling here But, to support this federal advance into local fields, the Court brings forward three railroad rate cases: The Shreveport Case, Houston, E . & W. Texas Ry. Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S.Ct. 833, Wisconsin R. Comm. v. Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563\n, 42 S.Ct. 232, 22 A.L.R. 1086, and New York v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 591\n, 42 S.Ct. 239.\n These cases give no support to the idea that, in absence of conflict between state and federal policy or regula- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 242]\n\u00a0\n tion, Congress has power to control labor conditions in production or intrastate transportation. In each, the federal interference is shown necessary in order to protect national authority, interstate commerce, and interstate rates established under federal law. Brief reference to the conditions that led up to these cases and the substance of the decisions will be sufficient to show they have no application here.\n In 1906 and 1907, Minnesota reduced intrastate rates substantially below lawfully established interstate rates. Suits were brought by their stockholders to restrain the carriers from obeying, and state officers from enforcing, the local rates on the ground, inter alia, that they were repugnant to the commerce clause, U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3, and that enforcement would necessarily interfere with and burden interstate transportation by the carriers. The Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.,N.S., 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18. The controversy was everywhere regarded as important. See page 395, 33 S.Ct. page 738. The facts found by the special master and adopted by the circuit court are stated in its opinion (Shepard v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co., C.C., 1911, 184 F. 765, 775-794) and summarized in the opinion of this Court. Pages 381-395, 33 S.Ct. pages 733-738. They show that the intrastate rates discriminated against interstate commerce and made it impossible for the carriers to collect, or for the United States to enforce, valid higher interstate rates. The trial court held the state measures repugnant to the commerce clause and upon that ground, among others, enjoined enforcement of the rates they prescribed.\n The cases were argued here in April, 1912, and decided June 9, 1913. This Court upheld the state rates, notwithstanding the commerce clause, the Act to Regulate Commerce, 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., the interstate rates lawfully established in accordance with federal law, and the destructive discrimination. It held that, in the absence of a finding by the Interstate Commerce Commission of unjust dis- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 243]\n\u00a0\n crimination, the intrastate rates were valid. The opinion reserved, page 419, 33 S.Ct. page 748, the question whether the Commission was empowered to make the determination. And that question was decided in the Shreveport Case, Houston, E. & W.T. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 342, 357\n, 34 S. Ct. 833, 838.\n That case was pending here before the decision in the Minnesota Rate Cases, and was decided in June, 1914. The Interstate Commerce Commission had found that rates prescribed by Texas operated to discriminate against interstate traffic from Shreveport, Louisiana, into Texas moving on lawfully established interstate rates. In order to eliminate the discrimination, the Commission directed the carriers to cease charging higher rates for interstate transportation than those charged for transportation between Texas points. This Court held the carriers free to raise the intrastate rates so as to remove the discrimination.\n Wisconsin R. Comm. v. Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co., 1922, \n257 \nU.S. 563\n, 42 S.Ct. 232, 22 A.L.R. 1086, upheld  15a of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  15a, added by  422, Transportation Act, 1920, which empowered the Interstate Commerce Commission to remove discrimination resulting from intrastate rates unduly low, as compared with corresponding rates fixed under that section.\n New York v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 591\n, 42 S.Ct. 239, held that intrastate rates so low that they discriminated against interstate commerce within the meaning of the Transportation Act, 1920, may constitutionally be increased under that Act by the Commission to conform with like rates in interstate commerce fixed by it.\n The constitutional questions decided in these three cases were essentially different from the one of federal power here presented. The state measures there overborne were repugnant to existing federal regulations of interstate commerce. Application of the lower state rates made it impossible for federal authority to require, or to enable, \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 244]\n\u00a0\n carriers to collect interstate rates lawfully established as just and reasonable. The policy and provisions of the New York State Labor Relations Act (Labor Law,  700 et seq.) are in substance precisely the same as the national policy and the National Labor Relations Act. The State's interest, purpose, and ability to safeguard against possible interruption of production and service by labor disputes are not less than those of the federal government. The State's need of continuous service is immediate, while the effect of interruption on interstate or foreign commerce would be mediate, indirect, and relatively remote. The record fails to disclose any condition, existing or threatened, to suggest as necessary federal action to protect interstate commerce, or any other interest of the government against interruption or interference liable to result from controversies between these employers and their employees. The right of the States, consistently with national policy and law, freely to exert the powers safeguarded to them by the Federal Constitution is essential to the preservation of this government. United States v. E. C. Knight Co., \n156 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 13 S., 15 S.Ct. 249, 253, 254; Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 21\n, 9 S.Ct. 6, 10. Asseveration of need to uphold our dual form of government and the safeguards set for protection of the States and the liberties of the people against unauthorized exertion of federal power, does not assure adherence to, or conceal failure to discharge, duty to support the Constitution. See Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, supra, pages 548-550, 55 S.Ct. pages 851, 852. Cf. National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., supra, pages 29, 30, 57 S.Ct. pages 620, 621.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice REED concurring in part, dissenting in part.\n While concurring in general with the conclusions of the Court in Consolidated Edison Company v. National Labor Relations Board and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers v. National Labor Relations Board, I find myself in disagreement with the conclusion that the National Labor Relations Board was 'without authority to require the petitioning companies \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 245]\n\u00a0\n to desist from giving effect to the Brotherhood contracts, as provided in subdivision (f) of paragraph one of the Board's order.' In that paragraph the petitioner companies are ordered to:\n'I. Cease and desist from:\n\n'(f) Giving effect to their contracts with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.'\n\n It is agreed that the 'fundamental purpose of the Act is to protect interstate and foreign commerce from interruptions and obstructions caused by industrial strife.' This is to be accomplished by contracts with labor organizations, reached through collective bargaining. The labor organizations in turn are to be created through the self-organization of workers, free from interference, restraint or coercion of the employer. \n1\n The forbidden interference is an unfair labor practice, which the Board, exclusively, is empowered to prevent by such negative and affirmative action as will effectuate the policies of the Act. \n2\n To interpret the Act to mean that the Board is without power to nullify advantages obtained by the Edison companies through contracts with unions, partly developed by the unlawful interference of the Edison companies with self-organization, is to withdraw from the Board the specific authority granted by the Act to take affirmative action to protect the workers' right of self-organization, the basic privilege guaranteed by the Act. Freedom from employer domination flows from freedom in self-organization.\n It is assumed that the terms of these contracts in all respects are consistent with the requirements of the National Labor Relations Act and are in themselves, considered apart from the actions of the Edison companies in securing their execution, advantageous in preserving industrial harmony. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 246]\n\u00a0\n The Board found that the Consolidated Edison Company and its affiliates, the respondents before the Board, 'deliberately embarked upon an unlawful course of conduct, as described above, which enabled them to impose the I.B.E.W. upon their employees as their bargaining representative and at the same time discourage and weaken the United which they opposed. From the outset the respondents contemplated the execution of contracts with the I.B.E.W. locals which would consummate and perpetuate their plainly illegal course of conduct in interfering with, restraining, and coercing their employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed to them under Section 7 of the Act. It is clear that the granting of the contracts to the I.B.E.W. by the respondents was a part of the respondents' unlawful course of conduct and as such constituted an interference with the rights of their employees to self-organization. The contracts were executed under such circumstances that they are invalid, notwithstanding that they are in express terms applicable only to members of the I.B.E.W. locals. If the contracts are susceptible of the construction placed upon them by the respondents, namely, that they were exclusive collective bargaining agreements, then, a fortiori, they are invalid.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The evidence upon which this finding is based is summarized in detail in 4 N.L.R.B., pages 83 to 94. It shows a consistent effort on the part of the officers and foremen of the Edison Company and its affiliates, as well as other employees of the Edison companies-formerly officers in the recently disestabilished 'Employees' Representation Plans,' actually company unions-to further the development of the I.B.E.W. unions by recognition, contracts for bargaining, openly expressed approval, \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 247]\n\u00a0\n establishment of locals and by permitting solicitation of employees on the time and premises of the Edison companies. By the Wagner Act employees have 'the right to self-organization.' It is an 'unfair labor practice for an employer' to 'interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees' in the exercise of that right. \n4\n The Board concluded that the contracts with the I. B.E.W. unions were a part of a systematic violation by the Edison companies of the workers' right to self-organization.\n This determination set in motion the authority of the Board to issue an order to cease and desist from the unfair labor practice and to take 'such affirmative action ... as will effectuate the policies of this Act.' Section 10(c), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(c). The evidence was clearly sufficient to support the conclusion of the Board that the Edison companies entered into the contracts as an integral part of a plan for coercion of and interference with the self-organization of their employees. This justified the Board's prohibition against giving effect to the contracts. The 'affirmative action' must be connected with the unfair practices but there could be no question as to the materiality of the contracts. As this Court, only recently, said, as to the purpose of the Congress in enacting this Act:\n'It had before it the Railway Clerks Case (Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Ry. & S.S. Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548\n, 50 S.Ct. 427) which had emphasized the importance of union recognition in securing collective bargaining, Report of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, S.Rep. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 17, and there were then available data showing that once an employer has conferred recognition on a particular organization it has a marked advantage over any other in securing the adherence of employees, and hence in preventing the recognition of any other.'5\n\n To this, it is answered that the extent of the coercion is left to 'mere conjecture'; that it would be an 'extrava gant' \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 248]\n\u00a0\n assumption to say that none of the 30,000 members 'joined voluntarily'; and that the 'employers' practices, which were complained of, could be stopped without imperiling the interests of those who for all that appears had exercised freely their right of choice.' 6 On the question whether or not the Edison companies' activities as to these contracts were a part of a definite plan to interfere with the right of self-organization, these answers are immaterial. It is suggested that the problem of the contracts should be approached with three cardinal considerations in mind: (1) that one contracting party is an 'independently established' labor organization, free of domination by the employer; (2) that the contracts grant valuable collective bargaining rights; and (3) that they contain provisions for desirable working privileges. Such considerations should affect discretion in shaping the proper remedy. They are negligible in determining the power of the Board. They would, if given weight, permit paternalism to be substituted for self-organization. The findings of the Board, based on substantial evidence, are conclusive. \n7\n There was evidence of coercion and interference, and the Board did determine that the policies of the Act would be effectuated by requiring the companies to cease giving effect to these contracts.\n The petitioners, however, aside from the merits, raise procedural objections. It is contended that before the Board could have authority to order the Edison companies to cease and desist from giving effect to their contracts with the unions, it was necessary that the unions as well as the Edison companies should have legal notice or should appear; that the unions were indispensable parties. This Court has held to the contrary in National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, \n303 \nU.S. 261\n, 58 S.Ct. 571, 115 A.L.R. 307. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 249]\n\u00a0\n This case determined that where an employer has created and fostered a labor organization of employees, thus interfering with their right to self- organization, the employer can be required without notice to the organization, to withdraw all recognition of such organization as the representative of its employees. It is said that this case 'is not apposite, as there no question of contract between employer and employee was involved. The Board had found upon evidence that the employer had created and fostered the labor organization in question and dominated its administration in violation of Section 8(2).'8 In the instant case it was found that no such domination existed. In the Greyhound Case, the Board found not only domination under Sec. 8(2) but also, as in this case, an unfair labor practice under Sec. 8(1). The company's violation of Sec. 8(1) was predicated on its interference with self-organization. \n9\n In the Greyhound Case it was said that the organization was not entitled to notice and hearing because 'the order did not run against the Association.' 10 Here the unions are affected by the action on the contracts, exactly as the labor organization in the Greyhound Case was affected by the order to withdraw recognition. It would seem immaterial whether those contracts were violative of one or both or all the prohibited unfair labor practices.\n A further procedural objection is found in the failure of the complaint, or any of its amendments, to seek specifically a cease and desist order against continued operation under the contracts. The companies were charged with allowing organization meetings on the company time and on company property, permitting solici- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 197, 250]\n\u00a0\n tation of membership during company time, and paying overtime allowances to those engaged in soliciting or coercing workers to join the contracting unions. The complaint said that similar aid was not extended to a competing union and that office assistance was given to the effort to get members for the contracting unions. These charges made it obvious that the contracts were obtained from the unions which were improperly aided by the Edison companies in violation of the prohibitions against interference with self-organization. Contracts so obtained were necessarily at issue in an examination of the acts in question.\n Certainly the Edison companies and the contracting unions could have been allowed on a proper showing a further hearing on the question of the companies continuing recognition of the contracts. By section 10(f) the Edison companies and the unions could obtain a review of the Board's order. In that hearing either or both could show to the court (Sec. 10(e)) that additional evidence as to the contracts was material and that it had not been presented because the aggrieved parties had not understood that the contracts were subject to a cease and desist order or had not known of the proceeding. The court could order the Board to take the additional evidence. This simple practice was not followed. Although all parties were before the lower court on the review, the petitioners chose to rely on the impotency of the Board to enter an order affecting the contracts.\n In these circumstances the provision of the order requiring the Edison companies to cease from giving effect to their contracts with the contracting unions is proper.

ARKANSAS-LOUISIANA PIPE LINE CO.(1938)\nNo. 458\nArgued: February 28, 1938Decided: April 4, 1938\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Louisiana. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 604, 605]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. E. L. Richardson and F. A. Blanche, both of Baton Rouge, La., for appellant.\n Mr. Leon O'Quin, of Shreveport, La., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether a state statute imposing a privilege tax on the production of mechanical power contravenes the interstate commerce clause in so far as it is applied to an engine used to supply mechanical power to a compressor which increases the pressure of natural gas and thus permits it to be transported to purchasers in other states.\n Act No. 6 of the Regular Session of 1932 of the Louisiana Legislature, with certain qualifications and exceptions not material here, provides for a license tax to be paid by every one engaged within the state in the business of manufacturing or generating electricity for heat, light or power (section 1), or of selling electricity not manufactured or generated by him or it (section 2). Section 3 provides that every person, firm, corporation, or association, engaged within the state in any business, which uses in the conduct of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 604, 606]\n\u00a0\n that business electrical or mechanical power of more than ten horsepower and does not procure all the power from a taxpayer subject to sections 1 or 2, 'shall be subject to the payment of an excise, license or privilege tax of One Dollar ($1.00) per annum for each horsepower of capacity of the machinery or apparatus, known as the 'prime mover' or 'prime movers,' operated by such person, firm, corporation or association of persons, for the purpose of producing power for use in the conduct of such business or occupation.'\n Appellee is engaged within Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas in the business of producing and buying, transporting and selling, natural gas. The gas is obtained from the Monroe and Richland fields in Louisiana, and transported through appellee's 20-inch pipe line, one of the largest in the Southwest, which extends from Sterlington, La., to Blanchard, La., where one branch goes west into Texas, and the other north into Texas and Arkansas up to Little Rock. Ninety-six and 6\/10 per cent. of the gas transported through this line during the fiscal year ended July 31, 1933, was delivered outside the state of Louisiana.\n The natural gas cannot be transmitted through this pipe line for these distances in amounts sufficient to meet the needs of appellee's customers, unless it is delivered into the pipe line at a pressure higher than that at which it comes from the wells. Accordingly, appellee maintains in Louisiana, at the point of intake into the line, its 'Munce Compressor Station,' where are located ten pumps, or natural gas compressors, which operate to increase the pressure of the gas to the required extent. These compressors are directly connected to ten four- cylinder 1,000 horsepower Cooper Bessemer internal combustion gas burning engines. There are also two 250 horsepower gas burning engines for general power service at the station. The tax is laid on the privilege \n\n[303 \nU.S. 604, 607]\n\u00a0\n of operating these twelve gas engines, known as 'prime movers,'1 and is imposed at the rate of $1 per horsepower capacity of the engine-i.e., a total tax of $10,500.\n Appellee's complaint, setting forth these facts, was filed in the District Court for Western Louisiana. It prayed that the tax be declared invalid and that the appellant, sheriff, be enjoined from selling appellee's property to enforce payment of $7,316, plus certain penalties and attorney fees, as the balance of the 'prime mover tax' due for the year ending July 31, 1933.2 An ex parte temporary restraining order was issued. A statutory three-judge court was convened, and a preliminary injunction granted, D.C., 17 F.Supp. 34. The statute was held invalid for the reason, among others, that as applied to this case it imposed an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. On a rehearing, the court, with one dissent, determined again that it was invalid, with the violation of the commerce clause as the sole basis of decision, D.C., 17 F.Supp. 36. 3 After answer and submission of affidavits \n\n[303 \nU.S. 604, 608]\n\u00a0\n by both parties, the court granted a permanent injunction, 20 F.Supp. 676. The case was brought here on direct appeal. Judicial Code  238(3), 266, as amended, 28 U.S.C.A.  345(3), 380.\n First. The character of the tax act under consideration is clear. It is a revenue measure obtaining funds by levying a privilege tax on those generating or selling electricity in Louisiana. Sections 1 and 2. Presumably to protect this source of revenue against tax-free competition, section 3,4 with \n\n[303 \nU.S. 604, 609]\n\u00a0\n broad exemptions not assailed here, subjects the users of electrical or mechanical power, not procured from those subject to sections 1 or 2, to a tax of one dollar per annum for each horsepower of capacity of the machinery operated by the taxpayer for the purpose of producing this power. The state court has held that section 3, here in question, does not lay a tax on those who own the machines but on those who use them in the conduct of their business, State ex rel. Porterie v. H. L. Hunt, Inc., 182 La. 1075, 1079-1080, 162 So. 777, 103 A.L.R. 9, a decision accepted, so far as the incidence of the tax is concerned, as a matter of local law conclusive on us. St. L.S.W.R. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 362\n, 35 S.Ct. 99; Storaasli v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 57, 62\n, 51 S.Ct. 354, 355. We regard the tax as one upon the privilege of producing the power.\n Second. The language of the state statute makes it quite certain that this privilege tax falls alike on those engaged in interstate or in intrastate commerce, or in both. While a privilege tax by a state for engaging in interstate business has frequently met the condemnation of this Court as a regulation of commerce,5 privilege taxes \n\n[303 \nU.S. 604, 610]\n\u00a0\n for 'carrying on a local business,' even though measured by interstate business, have been sustained. American Mfg. Co. v. St. Louis, \n250 \nU.S. 459\n, 39 S.Ct. 522; Ficklen v. Shelby County Taxing District, \n145 \nU.S. 1\n, 12 S.Ct. 810.6 Cf. Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, \n303 \nU.S. 250\n, 58 S.Ct. 546, decided February 28, 1938. The present case falls well within the line of state tax authority.\n Taxation by the states of the business of interstate commerce is forbidden only because it is deemed an interference with that commerce, the uniform regulation of which is necessarily reserved to the Congress. Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 400\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L. R.A.,N.S., 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18. As this source of revenue, even if treated in a nondiscriminatory manner, is withdrawn from local reach by inference from the delegated grant, the exemption of those engaged in interstate commerce from the taxation others bear should not be extended beyond the necessity of keeping that commerce free from interference. Consequently, property taxes on the instrumentalities or net income taxes on the proceeds of interstate commerce are upheld. Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minn., \n246 \nU.S. 450\n, 38 S.Ct. 373; United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321\n, 38 S.Ct. 499, Ann.Cas.1918E, 748.\n Privileges closely connected with the commerce may be regarded as distinct for purposes of taxation. So, local privilege taxes on storage in transit, compressing or dealing in cotton, already moving in its interstate journey from plantation to mill, are validated as imposed upon operations in connection with a commodity withdrawn from the transportation movement. Federal Compress & Warehouse Co. v. McLean, \n291 \nU.S. 17, 21\n, 54 S.Ct. 267, 268; Chassaniol v. Greenwood, \n291 \nU.S. 581\n, 54 S.Ct. 541; cf. State of Minnesota v. Blasius, \n290 \nU.S. 1\n, 54 S.Ct. 34. And similar taxes are upheld for the privilege of mining ores or producing gas, notwithstanding the 'practical continuity' of the taxed productive operation and the interstate movement. Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 604, 611]\n\u00a0\n \n262 \nU.S. 172\n, 43 S.Ct. 526; Hope Natural Gas Co. v. Hall, \n274 \nU.S. 284\n, 47 S.Ct. 639. In Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165\n, 52 S.Ct. 548, an Idaho statute taxing the generation of electricity at so much a kilowatt hour was upheld because a difference was perceived between the conversion of the mechanical energy of falling water into electrical energy and the transportation of the latter. The tax here imposed on the operation of the machinery is of the same type.\n The power used by the appellee is obtained from internal combustion engines which transform the potential energy of natural gas into mechanical power, transmitted by piston and piston-rod from the combustion chamber of the engine to the compression chamber of the compressor. While the engine and compressor units are assembled on a common bed plate, their functions are thus seen to be as completely separate as if they operated through belting. The engine is the 'prime mover' of the tax act, producing power to drive the compressor. While the use of the engine for the production of power synchronizes with the transmission of that power to the compressor, production occurs prior to transmission. It is just as much local as the generation of electrical power.\n Helson v. Kentucky, \n279 \nU.S. 245\n, 49 S.Ct. 279; State Tax Commission v. Interstate Natural Gas Co., Inc., \n284 \nU.S. 41\n, 52 S.Ct. 62; and Cooney v. Mountain States T. & T. Company, \n294 \nU.S. 384\n, 55 S.Ct. 477, are pressed upon us as controlling authorities for the invalidation of the tax. We think they belong to the category of cases which construe the state tax acts involved as taxes on interstate commerce and its instrumentalities rather than on operations closely connected with but distinct from that commerce. In the Interstate Case and the Cooney Case taxes levied on the business of engaging in interstate commerce were held invalid. Likewise, in the Helson Case, this Court concluded that the tax on gasoline brought into the state and used on an interstate ferry was analogous to a tax on the use of the ferry itself \n\n[303 \nU.S. 604, 612]\n\u00a0\n in transit and therefore within the rule prohibiting state taxes on commerce. A narrow distinction in fact exists between the tax held invalid in the Helson Case and the valid tax considered in Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249\n, 53 S.Ct. 345, 87 A.L.R. 1191, where a tax on gasoline brought into the state, stored and then used to drive engines in interstate transportation, was held valid. The storage and withdrawal was an intrastate, taxable event. See, also, Edelman v. Boeing Air Transport, \n289 \nU.S. 249, 252\n, 53 S.Ct. 591, 592; Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, \n286 \nU.S. 472, 479\n, 52 S.Ct. 631, 634, 84 A.L.R. 831.\n Third. To determine whether this challenged state tax enactment is invalid as an interference with interstate commerce under the decisions of this Court, the connection of the privilege taxed with interstate commerce has been considered. Other factors also show that the tax here does not interfere with interstate commerce. The tax is without discrimination in form or application as between inter and intra state commerce and it cannot be imposed by more than one state. The course of interstate commerce is clogged by taxes designed or applied so as to hamper its free flow. Section three, however, bearing equally on all use, is only complementary to the taxes of sections 1 and 2. Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., \n300 \nU.S. 577, 584\n, 57 S.Ct. 524, 527. It bears generally on all use of power and is not discriminatory. It obviously adds to the cost of the interstate commerce. But increased cost alone is not sufficient to invalidate the tax as an interference with that commerce. Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U.S. at 250, 58 S.Ct. 546, supra.\n It was held by the District Court that this is a tax which may be levied by other states and so is invalid, and that a state's desire to save gas for its citizens may induce it to raise the privilege tax to prohibitory rates. It is true that each state through which a pipe line passes could lay a tax on the use of engines for the production of power but that would not be multiple taxation \n\n[303 \nU.S. 604, 613]\n\u00a0\n 'merely because interstate commerce is being done,' as discussed in Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U.S. at 256, 58 S.Ct. 546, 549, supra, and the authorities there cited. It would not be a tax on the same activity, either in form or in substance. Like a property tax on the pipes or equipment in different states, it would be a different tax, on a different and wholly separate subject matter, with no cumulative effect caused by the interstate character of the business. It would not be multiple taxation for each state to tax the 'booster station' ad valorem as property. Neither is it prohibited multiple taxation to have the possibility of other privilege taxes on the production of power. It is length of line, not interstate commerce, which makes another tax possible.\n The decree of the District Court is reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of the opinion the decree should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or determination of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This term, used in section 3, supra, is not defined elsewhere in the statute. Webster's New International Dictionary, 2d Ed. unabridged, 1935, p. 1964, contains the following: 'prime mover. Mech. ... b An initial source of motive power, as an engine, or machine, the object of which is to receive and modify force and motion as supplied by some natural source, and apply them to drive other machinery, as a water wheel, a water-pressure engine, a wind-mill, a turbine, a tidal motor, a steam engine or other heat engine, etc.' As explained by expert witnesses for the appellant, the internal combustion gas engine is a prime mover which converts heat energy, contained in the natural gas as fuel, into mechanical energy, then supplied to and used by the compressor unit. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Appellee alleged that it has paid part of the tax imposed by the statute in order to avoid a forced sale. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The first opinion also held the statute invalid in its entirety (on the authority of Union Sulphur Co. v. Reid, D.C., 17 F.Supp. 27), as a property tax laid at a rate prohibited by the State Constitution, and as a denial of due process in providing for collection without any review of the action of the state supervisor or public accounts. After the decision in State ex rel. Porterie v. H. L. Hunt, Inc., 182 La. 1073, 162 So. 777, 103 A.L.R. 9, holding the tax a license rather than a property tax, consonant with both the State Constitution and Fourteenth Amendment, the District Court granted a rehearing. The second opinion conceded the general validity of the act, but held it an undue burden on interstate commerce as applied to appellee. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 'Section 3. In addition to all other taxes of every kind imposed by law, every person, firm, corporation or association of persons engaged in the State of Louisiana in any business or occupation, which person, firm, corporation or association of persons uses in the conduct of such business or occupation, at any time, electrical or mechanical power of more than ten horsepower and does not procure all the power required in the conduct of such business or occupation from a person, firm, corporation or association of persons subject to the tax imposed by Section 1 or Section 2 of this act, shall be subject to the payment of an excise, license or privilege tax of One Dollar ($1.00) per annum for each horsepower of capacity of the machinery or apparatus, known as the 'prime move' or 'prime movers,' operated by such person, firm, corporation or association of persons, for the purpose of producing power for use in the conduct of such business or occupation; provided that any user of power securing all or any part of the power required in the conduct of the business or occupation of such user from a person, firm, corporation or association of persons subject to the tax imposed by Section 1 or Section 2 of this act, shall not be liable for the tax imposed by this Section 3, or for a greater tax under this Section 3, as the case may be, because of the employment of stand-by power facilities by such user during periods of failure of the supply of purchased power; and provided further that any person, firm, corporation or association of persons the principal use of whose electric facilities is the generation of electricity for sale, shall not be subject to an additional tax under this Section 3 on the horsepower capacity of any machinery or apparatus used in the generation of electricity; and provided further that in computing the tax imposed by this Section 3, there shall be excluded from the horsepower capacity of all machinery and apparatus operated, that part of such capacity used in a mechanical, agricultural or horticultural pursuit, or any other occupation exempt from a license tax under Section 8 of Article X of the Constitution of Louisiana, or in operating a sawmill or a mill for grinding sugar-cane or producing raw sugar, or in conducting any business of selling electricity or any business conducted under any franchise or permit granted by the State of Louisiana or any subdivision thereof, or in propelling or motivating any automobile, truck, tug, vessel, or other self- propelled vehicle, on land, water or air.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Cooney v.

Townsend, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 620, 621]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n When this case was here before,1 petitioner was held entitled to recover compensation from the respondent for the taking of lands belonging to the petitioner constituting a portion of a larger tract granted to the Creek Nation in 1833. The boundary lines of petitioner's lands had been erroneously run in 1872, and, as a result, an area set apart for other Indian tribes included over 5,000 acres belonging to the petitioner. Those tribes ceded their lands to the respondent upon an agreement that allotments should be made to their members in severalty. The Act of February 13, 1891,2 which ratified this agreement, provided that any lands not so allotted should be opened to settlement and sold to settlers, the proceeds to be covered into the Treasury as public moneys. Pursuant to this statute lands which in truth belonged to petitioner were, due to the error in the survey of 1872, allotted and patented to Sac and Fox Indians and sold and patented to settlers in the period from 1893 to 1909. The patentees have since held adversely to petitioner. As was said in the former opinion, 'The tribe contended for the value in 1926, when the suit was brought; while the government stood for the value at the time of the appropriation, which it insisted was in 1873, when Darling's erroneous survey was approved by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, or, in the alternative, at the time the lands were disposed of under the act of 1891.' It was held that the alternative contention was correct and, as the Court of Claims had awarded the petitioner judgment for the 1926 value, the cause was reversed and remanded. Upon a further hearing that court overruled the claim of petitioner that the dates of actual disposal were those as of which value \n\n[302 \nU.S. 620, 622]\n\u00a0\n should be ascertained and valued the lands taken as of February 13, 1891, the date of the act pursuant to which the executive had caused them to be patented.\n In the former opinion, after holding that the approval of the erroneous survey in 1873 did not constitute an appropriation of petitioner's lands, the court said: 'But not so of the disposals under the act of 1891. They were intended from their inception to effect a change of ownership and were consummated by the issue of patents, the most accredited type of conveyance known to our law. True, they rested on an erroneous application of the act of 1891 to the Creek lands in the strip; but, as that application was confirmed by the United States, the matter stands as if the act had distinctly directed the disposals. It was through them that the lands were taken; so the compensation should be based on the value at that time.'\n The court below has misinterpreted that decision. The act of 1891 did not dispose of the lands. Its erroneous application and the consequent disposals of the lands to adverse holders constituted the taking by th United States. The petitioner is entitled to the present full equivalent of the value of the lands, without improvements, as of the date of the patents of the various parcels, if, as we assume, the patent in each instance issued promptly after the delivery of the final certificate; but if a substantial interval elapsed between the date of certificate and of patent, then as of the date of the certificate. A fair approximation or average of values may be adopted to avoid burdensome detailed computation of value as of the date of disposal of each separate tract.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n So ordered.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States v.

Warland, for New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner sued respondent in the District Court for Eastern New York to enjoin infringements of patents, two of which are here involved. One is Warth reissue patent, No. 19,117, dated March 20, 1934. The other is Warth patent, No. 1,967,195, dated July 17, 1934, a divisional patent. Both relate to methods for applying small disks of paper or foil, known as center spots, to cork cushions of crown caps. These caps are used to seal bottles containing pressure beverages. The center spot prevents contact of the liquid with the cork. The District Court adjudged both patents valid and infringed. 14 F.Supp. 255. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding the reissue patent not infringed and the divisional one invalid because of laches in filing the application on which it was granted. 2 Cir ., 86 F.2d 698.\n The questions presented by the petition for the writ, granted \n302 \nU.S. 664\n, 58 S.Ct. 12, 82 L.Ed. --, are these:\n\n 1. \n'Does this Court's decision in Webster Electric Co. v. Splitdorf Co. (\n264 \nU.S. 463\n, 44 S.Ct. 342) mean that, even in the absence of intervening adverse rights, an excuse must be shown for a lapse of more than two years in presenting claims in \n\n[304 \nU.S. 159, 161]\n\u00a0\n a divisional application regularly filed and prosecuted in accordance with patent office rules'?\n\n 2. \n'Where there has been more than two years delay in asserting specific claims in a divisional application, is it an excuse for the delay that there were claims in the parent patent which, on their face, covered and were reasonably believed to cover, the subject-matter of the divisional claims, even if a Court later interpreted the parent patent claims not to cover such subject-matter?'\n Our consideration of the case will be limited to these questions. Washington Virginia & Maryland Coach Co. v. Nat. Labor Relations Board, \n301 \nU.S. 142, 146\n, 57 S.Ct. 648, 649; Morehead v. People of N.Y. ex rel.

Houston Pasture Co., \n247 \nU.S. 240, 242\n, 38 S.Ct. 496. The first calls for decision upon a single point. It specifically assumes the absence of intervening rights and that the application was appropriately made. There is no question as to the validity of either the original or reissue patents.\n Warth filed his first application January 7, 1927, and his second November 7, 1930.1 From these came the original patent, January 6, 1931. It was to correct an error in the specification that the reissue patent was granted. Before issue of the original patent Johnson, November 26, 1929, filed application on which a patent issued April 5, 1932. April 4, 1933, two years and four months after the original patent was granted Warth, he carved from his second application a divisional one in which he copied the claims of the Johnson patent. In the interference declared upon the conflict, the Patent Office held Warth's \n\n[304 \nU.S. 159, 162]\n\u00a0\n divisional application entitled to the filing date of his first one, and awarded the claims of the Johnson patent to him as prior inventor. These are the claims held too late by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The claims of the reissue patent involved are shown in the margin. \n2\n The important feature is simultaneous application of presure and heat to the center spot to make it stick to the cork cushion in the cap. Neither these nor any other claims of the patent specify means to be employed to furnish the heat. The claims in suit of the divisional patent3 cover means to supply heat to be ap- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 159, 163]\n\u00a0\n plied to the center spots when subjected to pressure. The important feature is 'heating the pads (cork cushions) in the caps' before placing the spots upon them.\n The first application, January 7, 1927, stated: 'It may be desirable to secure the metal foil spot in position, prior to the heat and pressure steps, sufficiently to prevent dislodgement of the spot during any interval between assembling and final sticking. This may be accomplished, for example, by preheating the assembled crown, to soften the coating as soon as the metal foil spot is deposited.' That application contained claims, construed by the Circuit Court of Appeals to be broad enough to cover that disclosure. The Patent Office called for drawings to illustrate means for carrying out the method claimed. Accordingly, Warth showed, by way of illustration, that heat might be furnished by the punch used to cut the spots from the adhesive material and place them upon the cork in the cap, where, by the same stroke of the plunger, they might be subjected to pressure. When he filed the drawings, December 3, 1930, he canceled from the first application the statement just quoted and canceled the claims originally filed. The second application had already been filed. Both contained another statement: 'In carrying out the invention according to what is now considered the best practice, the coating will be softened by heat after the crown is assembled. This may be accomplished in any suitable manner, as by a heated plunger or a plunger and heated table. The heat softens \n\n[304 \nU.S. 159, 164]\n\u00a0\n the coating and renders it adhesive. ...' So far as concerns the question under consideration, it is broad enough to include means for supplying heat by the punch as shown by the drawings, and the preheating method claimed in the divisional application.\n The District Court found no adverse use of the preheating method prior to the filing date of the application for the reissue patent. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not disturb that finding. It found that Warth's disclosure of the preheating method was continuously before the Patent Office from the date of his first application, but that there was no claim for the preheating method on file from December 3, 1930, until April 4, 1933, when he filed application for the divisional patent. It held, citing Webster Electric Co. v. Splitdorf Co., supra, that prima facie the two-year limit applies to divisional applications, and that an applicant who waits longer before claiming an invention disclosed in his patent must justify his delay be proof of some excuse. It said (86 F.2d 698, 702): 'No such excuse appears here. Had Warth chosen to retain in his parent application broad generic claims which might cover the preheating method, then indeed the Splitdorf rule might not be applicable. ... But ... for a period of more than two years Warth apparently did not wish to claim the preheating method, having deliberately canceled the preheating specification from his original application and shaped his claims so as to exclude it and his patent having been granted January 6, 1931. He made no claim for preheating until more than two years thereafter, namely, April 4, 1933. In the meantime a patent containing claims for the preheating method had been granted to Johnson on April 5, 1932, and it was Warth's discovery of this fact which stirred him to action. As in the Splitdorf Case, had it not been for this competitor, Warth might never have considered the subject worth claiming as an invention.' The court meant that Warth had really abandoned his invention. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 159, 165]\n\u00a0\n See Western Electric Co. v. General Talking Pictures Corp., 2 Cir., 91 F. 2d 922, 927.\n But, as abandonment was not pleaded as a defense, Rev.St.  4920, as amended, 35 U.S.C.A.  69 and as Warth's disclosure was continuously before the Patent Office, clearly without any significance adverse to the petitioner is the fact that Warth formally canceled one disclosure from his first application and with it claims thought by the Circuit Court of Appeals broad enough to cover the disclosure. The continuity so maintained shows that Warth intended to retain, not to abandon, the disclosed invention. See Godfrey v. Eames, 1 Wall. 317, 325, 326; Clark Blade & Razor Co. v. Gillette Safety Razor Co., 3 Cir., 194 F. 421, 422.\n This case is not like Webster Electric Co. v. Splitdorf Co., supra. In that case, there came here the question of the validity of claims of a patent issued to Kane in 1918. In 1910 Kane had filed his first application, on which patent issued in 1916. In 1913 a patent covering the same subject matter issued to the Podlesake, to whom a reissue patent was granted in 1915. Later in 1915, Kane filed a divisional application which copied the claims of the Podlesak patent. They were decided in favor of the Podlesaks. Thereafter, June 17, 1918, Kane amended his divisional application by adding claims which were allowed, and September 24, 1918, patent issued to Webster Electric Company, Kane's assignee. In 1915, it had brought the suit against the Splitdorf Company. October 25, 1918, it filed a supplemental bill bringing in claims of the patent issued September 24, 1918\n\n\n This Court pointed out (\n264 \nU.S. 463\n, at page 465, 44 S.Ct. 342) that the claims in question 'were for the first time presented to the Patent Office, by an amendment to a divisional application eight years and four months after the filing of the original application, five years after the date of the original Podlesak patent, disclosing the subject- matter, and three years after the commencement of the present suit.' We sug- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 159, 166]\n\u00a0\n gested that it was doubtful whether the claims were not so enlarged as to preclude allowance under the original application; we found that Kane, deeming their subject matter not invention, did not intend to assert them, and, prior to 1918, did not entertain an intention to have them covered by patent. During all of this time their subject matter was disclosed and in general use; Kane and his assignee simply stood by and awaited developments. It was upon the reasons so stated that this Court declared ( \n264 \nU.S. 463\n, at page 466, 44 S.Ct. 342, 343): 'We have no hesitation in saying that the delay was unreasonable, and, under the circumstances shown by the record, constitutes laches, by which the petitioner lost whatever rights it might otherwise have been entitled to.'\n Upon a review of earlier cases we condemned the lower court's statement (Splitdorf Electrical Co. v. Webster Electric Co., 7 Cir., 283 F. 83, 93) that Chapman v. Wintroath, \n252 \nU.S. 126\n, 40 S.Ct. 234, fixed the time within which application for a divisional patent might be made at two years from date of the issue of the parent patent. We showed that the Chapman Case held that an inventor, whose application disclosed but did not claim an invention later patented to another, was not required, within one year after issue of the other patent, to file divisional application claiming the invention and so to raise issue of interference, but that, by analogy, the two-year period under Rev.St.  4886,4 applied rather than the one-year \n\n[304 \nU.S. 159, 167]\n\u00a0\n period of Rev.St.  4894,5 and that the opinion did not fix a hard and fast rule to be applied in every case of a divisional application. Then we said (\n264 \nU.S. 463\n, at page 471, 44 S.Ct. 342, 345): 'Our conclusion, therefore, is that in cases involving laches, equitable estoppel or intervening private or public rights, the two-year time limit prima facie applies to divisional applications and can only be avoided by proof of special circumstances justifying a longer delay. In other words, we follow in that respect the analogy furnished by the patent reissue cases.' That statement is not directly applicable to the precise question of laches upon which the case turned, but was made in reference to the question arising upon the lower court's erroneous interpretation of Chapman v. Wintroath, supra. See Wagenhorst v. Hydraulic Steel Co., 6 Cir., 27 F.2d 27, 29, 30; Wirebounds Patents Co. et al. v. Saranac Corp., 6 Cir., 37 F.2d 830, 840, 841; Utah Radio Products Co. v. Boudette, 1 Cir., 78 F. 2d 793, 799. It is clear that, in the absence of intervening adverse rights, the decision in Webster Electric Co. v. Splitdorf Co., supra, does not mean that an excuse must be shown for a lapse \n\n[304 \nU.S. 159, 168]\n\u00a0\n of more than two years in presenting the divisional application. Where there is no abandonment, mere delay in filing a divisional application for not more than two years after an intervening patent or publication does not operate to enlarge the patent monopoly beyond that contemplated by the statute. By Rev. St.  4886, as amended, 35 U.S.C.A.  31, delay in filing an application for not more than two years after an intervening patent or publication does not bar a patent unless the invention 'is proved to have been abandoned.' See Wirebounds Patents Co. et al. v. Saranac Corp., 6 Cir ., 37 F.2d 830, 840, 841; Id., 6 Cir., 65 F.2d 904, 905, 906. And, as none need be shown, there is no occasion to decide whether the facts stated in the second question are sufficient to constitute an excuse for the delay referred to.\n As our decision is limited to the first question presented, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals will be reversed and the case will be remanded to that court for decision of the other issues in the case in accordance with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n This Court declared in Webster Electric Co. v. Splitdorf Co., \n264 \nU.S. 463, 466\n, 471 S., 44 S.Ct. 342, 343:\n'In suits to enforce reissue patents, the settled rule of this court is that a delay for two years or more will 'invalidate the reissue, unless the delay is accounted for and excused by special circumstances, which show it to have been not unreasonable.' ...\n\n'Our conclusion, therefore, is that in cases involving laches, equitable estoppel or intervening private or public rights, the two-year limit prima facie applies to divisional applications and can only be avoided by proof of special \n\n[304 \nU.S. 159, 169]\n\u00a0\n circumstances justifying a longer delay. In other words, we follow in that respect the analogy furnished by the patent reissue cases.' (Italics supplied.)\n\n The rule announced in the Splitdorf Case was based upon a long line of decisions of this Court extending from Miller v. Bridgeport Brass Co., \n104 \nU.S. 350\n, decided in 1882.\n The majority opinion abandons the principle of the Splitdorf Case that either laches or equitable estoppel or intervening private rights or intervening public rights-in the absence of proved special circumstances- bars a divisional patent after a lapse of an unreasonable length of time- prima facie two years. It is now held that neither laches nor equitable estoppel may alone invalidate a patent without proof of 'intervening adverse rights.' The authorities relied on in the Splitdorf Case emphasized the right of the public-apart from provable adverse use by individuals-to require an applicant to pursue his right to a patent diligently and without enlargement of claims after filing an original application. \n1\n 'Any practice by the inventor and applicant for a patent through which he deliberately and without excuse postpones beyond the date of the actual invention, the beginning of the term of his monopoly, and thus puts off the free public enjoyment of the useful invention, is an evasion of the statute and defeats its benevolent aim.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n There is a further departure from the Splitdorf Case in the holding that two years delay in filing a divisional application after an intervening patent does not-in the absence of actual abandonment of the invention-bar the right to a 'divisional' patent. Abandonment is but one of many grounds for invalidating a patent. Equitable \n\n[304 \nU.S. 159, 170]\n\u00a0\n estoppel, intervening public rights, or unjustified and unexplained laches were considered in the Splitdorf Case and cases there relied on to be individually sufficient bars, without proof of abandonment. Unjustified delay and abandonment are separate defenses. If proof of abandonment is to be a prerequisite, laches as a separate defense is destroyed, although it has been recognized for more than fifty years. Unreasonable delay which serves to postpone the beginning of the seventeen-year monopoly limitation, not only is possible without abandonment of the invention, but is highly probable. With the destruction of the defense of laches the public loses the benefit of the principle that 'An inventor cannot without cause hold his application pending during a long period of years, leaving the public uncertain whether he intends ever to prosecute it, and keeping the field of his invention closed against other inventors.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The Court of Appeals following this settled principle-now abandoned- said: 4 'We think they (claims in the patent) are invalid for laches in filing the application for them. (Citing Webster Electric Co. v. Splitdorf Co. (supra).) ... These circumstances (facts of this case) invite operation of the two-year limitation designed to protect the public against obtaining in effect an extension of a patentee's monopoly by apathy and unexcused delay in bringing forward by divisional or reissue applications claims broader than those originally sought.' (Italics supplied.)\n While 'divisional' applications have never been expressly authorized by statute, the courts have long recognized their use as a part of Patent Office procedure. Petitioner's patent which the Court of Appeals found barred by laches was granted on a 'divisional' application. Patent Office regulations which have limited each application for a patent to a single invention and have re- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 159, 171]\n\u00a0\n quired a 'division' of an application containing claims for two separate and distinct inventions apparently gave rise to the procedural device of 'divisional applications.' The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, acting in a special appellate capacity5 and the Patent Office, have treated a 'divisional,' properly used, in some respects, as a substitute for an amendment. In accordance with this conception 'divisionals' have been for certain purposes, treated as 'continuations' of original applications and given the priority of original applications. The logical conclusion was reached that, after an original application merged in a patent, a 'divisional' application could not be attached to or considered as a 'continuation' of it, because 'there was nothing to be continued.' \n6\n After a patent is granted it passes 'beyond the control and jurisdiction' of the Patent Office; the proceedings are closed and the application can neither be amended nor serve as the basis for a new 'divisional' or 'continuing' application. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Here an application for a process patent was filed in 1927. November, 1930, in response to Patent Office re- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 159, 172]\n\u00a0\n quirement, a 'divisional' application was filed for a product patent. January, 1931, a process patent was granted on the original application. More than two years after the original application had merged into a process patent another application designated as a 'divisional' was filed ( April 4, 1933), for a second process patent-here involved. The Court of Appeals found this delay of six years to be without justification or excuse. Disregarding the previously recognized requirement that justification and excuse must be proven for such delay, the majority now hold that an applicant can, for six years, delay his claim for an alleged discovery without excuse, justification, or reason for the delay. This is permitted despite the fact that unclaimed disclosure of the alleged invention had been made in the 1927 process application and in the 1930 product application.\n Congress-given the power by the Constitution-has fixed the statutory limit of a patent monopoly at seventeen years. \n8\n By the procedural device of a 'divisional' application, designed to protect rights granted an inventor by statute, petitioner has carved for itself priority monopoly rights, beginning in 1927 and lasting until 1951-twenty-four years, or seven years more than Congress has authorized.\n In the remedy of reissue provided by statute for applicants whose claims fail to protect their entire discoveries,9 Congress has been alert to protect the public from such an extension of monopoly. A reissue patent must be based on oath that an applicant's original patent failed to cover its actual invention as a result of accident, inadvertence or mistake, and runs only for the unexpired portion of a seventeen-year patent grant. The use of 'divisionals' or 'continuations,' no longer subject to the defense of laches \n\n[304 \nU.S. 159, 173]\n\u00a0\n or unreasonable delay, will permit an applicant to obtain, by a non- statutory procedural device, monopoly privileges denied by the reissue statute.\n The essential additional claim in petitioner's 1934 'divisional' patent was only mentioned in the 1927 original application and the 1930 'divisional' application by way of casual suggestion and incidental illustration. \n10\n Even this casual suggestion was stricken from the 1927 application in December, 1930. These suggestive illustrations did not constitute parts of the inventions which the 1927 and 1930 applications sought to cover or secure. 11 The speculative suggestions-from separate applications for different inventions-are pieced together and held sufficient to 'continue' the 1927 application (after its merger in a patent) and the 1930 application, as support for the retroactive operation of a claim made for the first time in \n\n[304 \nU.S. 159, 174]\n\u00a0\n 1933. As a result of the destruction of the defense of laches in applying for 'divisional' applications, those familiar with a given field of industry may now insert speculative conjectures as disclosures in various applications and permit them to lie dormant until a competitor reduces speculation to practicality. Then, by the device of a 'divisional,' or if need be, as here, by 'divisional' on 'divisional,' such a competitor can be pursued with infringement suits and harassed into surrendering his business to an ingeniously dilatory applicant. 12 Thus, sweeping, indefinite and unclaimed disclosures, and adroit use of 'divisionals'- which laches and unreasonable delay are no longer sufficient to bar-are permitted to extend a patent's statutory life and to increase a patentee's reward beyond that granted by Congress.\n\"The patent laws are founded in a large public policy to promote the progress of science and the useful arts. The public, therefore, is a most material party to, and should be duly considered in, every application for a patent. ... But the arts and sciences will certainly not be promoted by giving encouragement to inventors to withhold and conceal their inventions for an indefinite time, or to a time when they may use and apply their inventions to their own exclusive advantage, irrespective of the public benefit, and certainly not if the inventor is allowed to conceal his invention to be brought forward in some after time to thwart and defeat a more diligent and active inventor, who has placed the benefit of his invention within the reach and knowledge of the public.' (In re Appeal of Mower, 15 App.D.C. 144.)'13 \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Motion to amend judgment denied \n304 \nU.S. 552\n, 58 S.Ct. 1051, 82 L. Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The first application extended to materials to be used in making center spots as well as to methods for applying them. The second application, because of a requirement of the Patent Office, omitted disclosures as to materials but included those as to methods that the first contained. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Claim 1.

This may be accomplished, for example, by preheating the assembled crown, to soften the coating as soon as the metal foil spot is deposited.

Svoboda and J. A. C. Kennedy, both of Omaha, Neb., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Edward J. Ennes, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Upon petitioner's insistence and respondent's admission, that the decision below conflicts with that of the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit in Miller v. Commissioner, 80 F.2d 219, we granted a writ of certiorari. \n304 \nU.S. 554\n, 58 S.Ct. 1038. The question presented is whether petitioner's \n\n[305 \nU.S. 44, 45]\n\u00a0\n taxable gain from sale in 1929 of 1,000 shares of stock is to be determined upon the basis of the cost of stock petitioner bought in that year, or upon the basis of lower cost of like shares earlier bought by him.\n The details found by the board of tax appeals may be given briefly. March 27, 1929 at cost of $49.90 each, petitioner bought 1,000 shares for which he received 10 separately numbered certificates covering 100 shares each and delivered them to a bank to be held as security for a loan. Some years earlier he had bought, at cost of $4.42 each, 1,000 shares of like stock for which he obtained certificates that he delivered to the same bank as collateral security, where they were held until the sales here involved. June 19, 1929 petitioner instructed his broker to sell 500 shares of the stock he bought March 27, and, to enable the broker to deliver, petitioner instructed the bank to give the broker certificates covering shares bought in that year. By mistake the bank delivered him certificates of shares included in the lot earlier purchased by petitioner. July 1, 1929 petitioner instructed the broker to sell the rest of the lot bought in that year and directed the bank to deliver the broker certificates of the stock petitioner intended to have sold. Again failing to follow instructions, the bank delivered the broker certificates of stock in the other lot. It may be taken as granted that, when he made his return, petitioner excusably assumed that the bank had followed his directions.\n He reported gain on the basis of cost of the stock purchased in that year. The commissioner calculated gain on the basis of cost of the stock earlier purchased and gave notice of deficiency. The board of tax appeals sustained his determination. 34 B.T.A. 555. The circuit court of appeals affirmed. 8 Cir., 94 F.2d 300.\n Petitioner contends that by this reference to amounts and dates of purchases, he adequately designated to the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 44, 46]\n\u00a0\n broker the shares to be sold; that in fact the shares so identified were sold and that the bank's delivery of certificates of other stock to the broker did not affect petitioner's order. Undoubtedly, petitioner sufficiently indicated to the broker and to the bank the shares he intended to sell. He plainly allocated the lots to be sold to the 1,000 shares he bought in 1929. But it does not follow that they were the shares sold. His intention to sell, even when coupled with his order to the broker and direction to the bank, cannot be held to constitute sale. Snyder v. Commissioner, \n295 \nU.S. 134, 137\n, 55 S.Ct. 737, 738. Notwithstanding his order to the broker to sell shares in the 1929 lot, petitioner was free later to direct that shares from the other lot be used for final consummation of the sale. And so, when the bank delivered him certificates of stock not designated in his order to sell, the broker may well have assumed that petitioner's final purpose was to sell the shares covered by the certificates that the bank sent him. He had no reason to suppose that the bank did not act in accordance with instructions given it by petitioner. The case is not different from what it would have been, if petitioner himself had delivered to the broker the certificates sent by the bank. Plainly, petitioner's contention that the certificates used to complete the sale did not cover the shares sold cannot be upheld. Helvering, Commissioner v. Rankin, \n295 \nU.S. 123, 128\n, 55 S.Ct. 732, 734. The commissioner rightly computed gain on the basis of what was done rather than on what petitioner intended to do. United States v.

Sherier, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 32, 34]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Crandal Mackey, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 32, 35]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The lower court held a decree of the circuit court of Arlington County, Virginia, entered June 26, 1929, granting petitioner an absolute divorce from respondent upon the ground of desertion not entitled to recognition in the supreme (now district) court of the District of Columbia. The question arose upon his application to that court to set aside or modify a decree it entered October 29, 1925 granting him divorce a mensa et thoro from respondent on the ground of cruelty.\n In the District of Columbia absolute divorce was not then permitted for desertion or cruelty. \n1\n In Virginia absolute divorce was authorized where either party willfully deserted or abandoned the other for three years. \n2\n The circuit courts there have jurisdiction over suits for divorce and alimony. No suit for divorce is maintainable unless one of the parties has been domiciled in the State for at least a year preceding its commencement. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioner and respondent married in 1909 and, until about the time he brought the suit for limited divorce, lived together in the District of Columbia. They had a son and daughter. The decree of separation awarded to him custody of the son, to her custody of the daughter, and \n\n[305 \nU.S. 32, 36]\n\u00a0\n directed him to pay $300 a month for support of wife and daughter.\n Petitioner's complaint in the Virginia court alleged that he was a resident of that State for the requisite time, showed that respondent was a resident of the District of Columbia, fully disclosed the proceedings and decree in the District court, and alleged continuous desertion commencing before and extending for more than three years after entry of that decree. Process of the Virginia court was served personally upon the respondent in the District of Columbia. She filed a plea stating that she appeared 'specially and for no other purpose than to file this plea to the jurisdiction of the court.' In that document she alleged that neither she nor petitioner had been a resident of Virginia for a year before commencement of the suit and asserted that he was not then a bona fide resident there but that the residence he was attempting to establish was for the sole purpose of creating jurisdiction in the court to hear and determine the suit for divorce and was therefore a fraud upon the court and not residence in contemplation of law. The plea prayed judgment whether the court 'can or will take any further cognizance of the action aforesaid.'\n The court entered a decree reciting that the cause came on for hearing upon the complaint, exhibits, other papers, and 'argument of counsel' and referring the cause to a commissioner in chancery to ascertain and report whether the court had jurisdiction to hear and determine it and whether a decree of divorce should be entered. The commissioner reported that 'by stipulation of counsel it was agreed', that he should only ascertain the facts raised in the plea to the jurisdiction and that no other matter should be inquired into or reported; that he had taken all the testimony submitted by the parties; that in his opinion petitioner was a bona fide resident of Arling ton \n\n[305 \nU.S. 32, 37]\n\u00a0\n County, Virginia, and that the court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the cause.\n Respondent filed exceptions, reiterating the allegations of her plea and asserting that the commissioner's findings were contrary to the evidence. There was a hearing upon the report and exceptions. After argument of counsel for the parties and upon consideration of the evidence, the court found that petitioner was a resident of Arlington County, Virginia, for the requisite time, that it had jurisdiction of the 'subject matter and of the parties', overruled the exceptions, and confirmed the report. Respondent having signified her desire to apply for an appeal, the court ordered operation of the decree suspended for a period of thirty days. It also granted respondent ten days 'within which to file such answer or other pleadings in this cause as she may wish.' She did not appeal or file answer or other pleading.\n The final decree states that the case came on for hearing upon specified papers and depositions of five named persons taken before a commissioner pursuant to notice served in Arlington County, on counsel who had entered special appearance for respondent, and upon her personally in the District of Columbia. It found: Respondent willfully deserted petitioner February 24, 1925; the desertion continued from that date; three years had elapsed since the entry of the decree a mensa et thoro; there has been no reconciliation, and none is probable. It granted petitioner absolute divorce, divested respondent of all rights in his property, and required him to pay $150 per month for support of the daughter. No alimony was allowed respondent.\n December 30, 1929 petitioner applied to the District court to have its decree set aside or modified so as not to require him to pay any amount for maintenance of respondent but to provide for the payment of a reason \n\n[305 \nU.S. 32, 38]\n\u00a0\n able sum for the support of their daughter. The application was based solely upon the Virginia decree. Respondent appeared and opposed the application but raised no question as to the jurisdiction of the Virginia court. It was denied. The court of appeals affirmed on the grounds that the lower court, having entered the decree, retained jurisdiction to enforce or modify its order for maintenance of the wife and daughter; that petitioner's removal to Virginia did not invest the courts of that State with authority to annul or supersede that jurisdiction; and that, the District court having first acquired jurisdiction of the subject matter, its authority continues until the matter is finally disposed of. 61 App.D. C. 48, 57 F.2d 414. In passing upon that application, neither court considered or decided any question as to jurisdiction of the Virginia court.\n April 16, 1935 petitioner filed in the District court another application to have its decree set aside or modified as before prayed. He then sought relief on three grounds: The decree of the Virginia court, the fact that his daughter had married and was no longer living with respondent, and diminution of his income. Respondent answered, alleging that petitioner never was a resident of Virginia and denying the desertion found by the Virginia court. There was a hearing, at which petitioner offered evidence showing the proceedings and decree in the Virginia court, the marriage of the daughter and that she was living with her husband. Then counsel for respondent applied for time to secure her attendance and that of witnesses who, as he said, would give testimony that petitioner went to Virginia for the sole purpose of getting a divorce, and that he never became a bona fide resident there. Petitioner's counsel admitted that, if present, respondent and the witnesses referred to would so testify, but insisted that the testimony would be incompetent. Respondent offered no other evidence. The trial court denied the application. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 32, 39]\n\u00a0\n The court of appeals, in an unreported opinion, held its earlier decision established the law of the case. Declaring petitioner not responsible for maintenance of his daughter after her marriage, it held that fact should be taken into account, and remanded the case for further consideration as to the amount of alimony to be allowed respondent. Petitioner applied for and the court granted rehearing. It heard argument and filed an opinion, in which it adhered to its ruling that its earlier decision was the law of the case, and held that the decision of the lower court refusing to enforce petitioner's decree of absolute divorce should stand. It said: 'The Virginia court did not have full jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter, and hence the decree was not entitled to full faith and credit. ... It was necessary ... under Haddock v. Haddock, \n201 \nU.S. 562\n, 26 S.Ct. 525, 5 Ann.Cas. 1, ... that Virginia be the last matrimonial domicil of the parties or, if not, that the wife be subjected to the jurisdiction of the court below, either by personal service within the State, or by voluntary appearance and participation in the suit'. It held that the matrimonial domicil was not in Virginia; that respondent's special appearance did not give the Virginia court full jurisdiction, or constitute waiver of her objection to jurisdiction. It held petitioner's application one addressed to the discretion of the lower court and that its omission to consider the marriage of the daughter constituted failure to exercise discretion. Accordingly, it reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion. 68 App.D.C. 240, 96 F.2d 512.\n Art. 4,  1, U.S.C.A.Const. Art. 4,  1 requires that judicial proceedings in each State shall be given full faith and credit in the courts of every other State. \n4\n The Act of May 26, 1790, 1 Stat. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 32, 40]\n\u00a0\n 122, as amended, R.S.  905, 28 U.S.C.  687, 28 U.S.C.A.  687 declares that judicial proceedings authenticated as there provided shall have such faith and credit given to them in every 'court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the State from which they are taken.' \n5\n Thus Congress rightly interpreted the clause to mean not some but full credit. Haddock v. Haddock, supra, page 567, 26 S.Ct. page 526. The Act extended the rule of the Constitution to all courts, Federal as well as State. Mills v. Duryee, 7 Cranch 481, 485.\n As to petitioner's domicil for divorce and his standing to invoke jurisdiction of the Virginia court, its finding that he was a bona fide resident of that State for the required time is binding upon respondent in the courts of the District. She may not say that he was not entitled to sue for divorce in the state court, for she appeared there and by plea put in issue his allegation as to domicil, introduced evidence to show it false, took exceptions to the commissioner's report, and sought to have the court sustain them and uphold her plea. Plainly, the determination of the decree upon that point is effective for all purposes in this litigation. Baldwin v. Traveling Men's Ass'n, \n283 \nU.S. 522, 525\n, 526 S., 51 S. Ct. 517, 518. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 32, 41]\n\u00a0\n Nor can it be said that the domicil was not adequate to support, in virtue of the rule of full faith and credit established by Congress, decree enforceable in the courts of the District of Columbia. Depending on the connection in which used, various meanings have been attributed to the phrase matrimonial domicil. See Atherton v. Atherton, \n181 \nU.S. 155, 171\n, 21 S.Ct. 544, 550; Andrews v. Andrews, \n188 \nU.S. 14, 40\n, 23 S. Ct. 237, 243; Haddock v. Haddock, supra, page 572, 26 S.Ct. page 528; Thompson v. Thompson, \n226 \nU.S. 551, 562\n, 33 S.Ct. 129, 131. Definition, inclusive and exclusive, is not to be found; it need not be attempted here. It is enough to say that care should always be taken to determine upon the facts and circumstances of each case whether, in accordance with the general rule, it is the domicil of the husband. See Cheely v. Clayton, \n110 \nU.S. 701, 705\n, 4 S.Ct. 328, 330; Thompson v. Thompson, supra. Cf. Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582, 592, 594; Cheever v. Wilson, 9 Wall. 108, 124. In this case, the wife has been adjudged by the decree a mensa et thoro, on which she relies, to have disrupted the marital relation. And by the decree of the Virginia court, the enforcement of which she opposes, she is adjudged to have persisted in desertion of petitioner for a period more than sufficient to entitle him under the laws of that State to dissolution of the bonds. Cf. Harding v. Harding, \n198 \nU.S. 317, 338\n, 339 S., 25 S.Ct. 679, 685. While in that State litigating the question of his standing to sue, she chose not to answer charges of willful desertion.\n This case differs essentially from Haddock v. Haddock, supra, relied on by the lower court. There the husband, immediately after marriage in New York, fled to escape his marital obligations and never returned to discharge any of them. The wife remained in that State. He acquired domicil in Connecticut and there obtained absolute divorce. She did not appear in the Connecticut court for any purpose. There was no suggestion that she was at fault or did anything to disrupt the marital relation. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 32, 42]\n\u00a0\n In this case, there exists none of the reasons on which we held the New York court not bound by the full faith and credit clause to enforce in that State the husband's Connecticut divorce. Petitioner frankly presented to the Virginia court the grounds on which he sought release. He gave respondent actual notice of the suit. She appeared, specially as she maintains, and raised and tried the question whether he had standing to sue. In view of these facts, and of her conduct, adjudged repugnant to the marital relation, it would be unreasonable to hold that his domicil in Virginia was not sufficient to entitle him to obtain a divorce having the same force in the District as in that State.\n As to respondent's appearance in the Virginia court.-The assertion in her plea that it was special and made for the sole purpose of challenging jurisdiction is of no consequence if in fact it was not so limited. Sugg v. Thornton, \n132 \nU.S. 524, 530\n, 10 S.Ct. 163, 165; Sterling Tire Corporation v. Sullivan, 9 Cir., 279 F. 336, 339. If the plea alone may not be held to amount to a general appearance, there arises the question whether, by her participation in the litigation and acquiescence in the orders of the court relating to merits, she submitted herself to its jurisdiction for all purposes. Her plea and conduct are to be considered together.\n There had been no claim of jurisdiction over her person. The plea did not challenge jurisdiction over petitioner or the court's authority, if appropriately invoked, to grant the decree petitioner sought. It merely asserted that he lacked domicil required by Virginia law. Her allegations and prayer show that the sole purpose of the plea was to join issue with petitioner's allegation of domicil in Virginia, to secure a finding against him on that point, to obtain decree that he had no standing to bring the suit and so put an end to his efforts to obtain divorce in that State. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 32, 43]\n\u00a0\n The recital in the decree of reference, that the cause came on for hearing upon, inter alia, argument of counsel, suggests that both parties were heard. The stipulation of counsel that the commissioner should only ascertain the facts raised by her plea shows action by both parties relating to merits, at least to the extent that it withdrew the case from the commissioner. The record discloses no challenge by respondent to the statement, in the decree overruling her exceptions, that the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties. The grant of time within which to answer implies application to that end. A motion for such an order relates to merits. Hupfeld v. Automaton Piano Co., C.C., 66 F. 788, 789. The service of notice of taking depositions upon respondent in the District of Columbia and upon her counsel in Virginia implies that petitioner's counsel understood that respondent had standing to appear and cross examine. Plainly her plea and conduct in the Virginia court cannot be regarded as special appearance merely to challenge jurisdiction. Considered in its entirety, the record shows that she submitted herself to the jurisdiction of the Virginia court and is bound by its determination that it had jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties. Cf. Andrews v. Andrews, supra, page 40, 23 S.Ct. page 243.\n No question is here presented as to the effect of the Virginia decree on the power of the District of Columbia court over alimony.\n Petitioner is entitled as a matter of right to have the Virginia decree given effect in the courts of the District of Columbia. The decree of the court of appeals must be reversed; the case will be remanded to the district court for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] D.C.

Goodwin, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Frederic H. Chase and Raymond P. Baldwin, both of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Boston-Continental National Bank, established in December, 1930, through consolidation of Boston National Bank and Continental National Bank, became insolvent. December 17, 1931, a receiver appointed by the Comptroller of the Currency took charge of its affairs. Petitioner is his successor. Among the bank's effects were four 'Note-Guaranty' Bonds-$40, 000, $52,000, $20,000, and $20,000-alike in form, dated in August and December, 1930, and June and July, 1931, with certain 'endorsements' showing extensions. Each purported to be executed by the maker of a described note as principal with respondent as surety, and was conditioned to pay to the bank the amount of the note upon default, etc.\n In June and September, 1932, the receiver brought separate actions at law upon three of these bonds. In each he alleged that the company was indebted to him for the specified penalty with interest; and for this he asked judgment. The three declarations are alike in form and allegations. One, typical of all, is copied below. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 471, 473]\n\u00a0\n There also is one of the note-guaranty bonds, typical of all. \n2\n Each declaration exhibited a bond, alleged that thereby the company bound itself to pay the bank a \n\n[303 \nU.S. 471, 474]\n\u00a0\n specified sum in the event of default, which had occurred, etc., that damages had been sustained whereby the surety had become indebted 'in the penal sum of said bond, with interest.'\n___ Schedule of Notes.

Cliff, Attorney-in-Fact. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 471, 475]\n\u00a0\n Answering, the company denied liability and alleged that, as the bank well knew, the bond was executed without authority, had been fraudulently obtained, was invalid.\n Before the three law actions were filed the surety company instituted four separate equitable proceedings in the Superior Court, Suffolk County, Mass., against the bank and makers of guaranteed notes. Each complaint alleged that the bank had fraudulently obtained the bond and asked that it be declared null and void. Later, the receiver became party in these causes and all were removed to the federal court. There, he filed separate answers, substantially alike, averring that the bond had been duly executed, that default had taken place, and that damages amounting to the full amount of the specified penalty had been sustained. Each answer concluded, 'Wherefore these defendants pray: 1. That the court determine the amount due from the plaintiff to Boston-Continental Bank and John B. Cunningham, its receiver, and order the plaintiff to pay the same with interest. 2. For such further relief as the court finds meet and just.'\n Copies of one complaint3 and answer4 thereto, typical of all, are in the margin. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 471, 476]\n\u00a0\n A jury was waived in the law actions and the seven causes went to an auditor and master with instructions \n\n[303 \nU.S. 471, 477]\n\u00a0\n to report findings of fact and conclusions of law; the former to be final. After taking much evidence he reported with\n___ 3. As to the allegations contained in the third paragraph of the bill of complaint, they say that the instrument, a copy whereof is attached to the bill of complaint marked 'A,' was duly executed by Westchester Discount Corporation by Joseph Stone, its treasurer, and was duly executed by the plaintiff, by Percy G. Cliff, its attorney-in-fact, and that an attested copy of said Cliff's general power of attorney was attached to the original instrument; that thereafter the plaintiff duly executed the instruments entitled 'Endorsements' by said Cliff, its attorney-in-fact, copies of which endorsements are attached to the bill of complaint marked 'C' and 'D'; that if a purported release was delivered to said Cliff by Continental National Bank by Terrell M. Ragan in the form attached to the bill of complaint marked 'B,' such purported release was delivered without authority of the board of directors of said Continental National Bank, was executed without consideration and is voidable and void. Except as aforesaid, they deny the allegations contained in said paragraph 3 of the bill of complaint.\n\n 4. \nThey deny the allegations contained in the fourth paragraph of the bill of complaint.\n\n 5. \nThey deny the allegations contained in the fifth paragraph of the bill of complaint.\n\n 6. \nFurther answering they say that the condition of said instrument, copy of which is attached to the bill of complaint marked 'A' as extended by instruments, copies of which are attached to the bill of complaint marked 'C' and 'D,' has been broken in that Westchester Discount Corporation, the principal named in said instrument, has not paid the notes described therein according to their terms, but on the contrary has failed, refused and declined to pay said notes and still continues so to refuse, notwithstanding the fact that all times have elapsed and all conditions have been fulfilled necessary to entitle Boston-Continental National Bank and John B. Cunningham, receiver of said bank, the successors to the obligee described therein, to payment in full of said notes; that the plaintiff was duly notified of the default in accordance with the provisions of said instrument; that the damages sustained by these defendants on account of the default of said Westchester Discount Corporation are in excess of $40,000.\n Wherefore these defendants pray:\n\n 1. \nThat the court determine the amount due from the plaintiff to Boston-Continental National Bank and John B. Cunningham, its receiver, and order the plaintiff to pay the same with interest.\n\n 2. \nFor such further relief as the court finds meet and just.\n (Signed.) By its Attorney, _ _, _ _. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 471, 478]\n\u00a0\n a finding of facts showing clearly that the bank obtained the bonds through the fraud of its president, Ragan, and Cliff, general agent of the company. Among other things he said: 'I rule that the bonds and 'endorsements' in suit were not binding obligations in the hands of the bank as a going concern, for the reason that Ragan's knowledge of their infirmities is imputed to the bank; and that the bonds and 'endorsements' would not be binding obligations in the hands of the receiver, if his rights were derived solely from the bank as distinguished from its creditors.' He further ruled that as Cliff, general agent of the surety company, knew the bonds would be shown to the bank directors and to any others entitled to inquire concerning the notes described therein for the purpose of deception, therefore, 'the bonds and 'endorsements' in suit are binding obligations in the hands of the receiver due to the fact that he represents the bank's creditors.'\n The District Court heard the causes on report and exceptions. It held the bonds void, and further 'adjudged and decreed that the counterclaim of the defendant receiver, set forth in his answer, be and the same is hereby dismissed.' \n\n[303 \nU.S. 471, 479]\n\u00a0\n By stipulation the causes were joined for appeal upon a single record. The Circuit Court of Appeals, 1 Cir., 90 F.2d 862, 864, affirmed the District Court, and said: 'The master and auditor held that the receiver in bringing these actions did not derive his right of recovery through the bank, but because one or more creditors of the bank were deceived, and as he represents creditors he derived his right of action through them. The receiver, however, makes no such allegations in his declaration.' 'It is clear from the pleadings that the receiver seeks to recover on these bonds as assets of the bank. In such an action, he stands no better than the bank itself. All defenses open against the bank in such a case are open against the receiver, and he is chargeable with knowledge of all facts known to the bank affecting the character of the claim.' 'If, therefore, the contract with the surety company was illegal as to the bank, because, as the master and auditor found that the bank was charged with the knowledge of its president, a recovery could not be had by the bank. A recovery based on the contract of surety cannot be had by the receiver, since a recovery must be based on the pleadings, and the allegations of liability in the plaintiff's declarations are based solely on the contract of surety.' In respect of the receiver's counterclaim set up in the equity suits, it said: 'The plaintiffs' counterclaim distinctly raises the question of the validity of the bonds. The issue of trust for the benefit of creditors is not raised or suggested.' 'The obligations of the surety company based on the depositors of the bank being injured by the giving of the bonds, and the receiver's claim against the surety company based on a trust relationship are not mentioned, and, we think, are not raised by the plaintiffs' counterclaim in the equity suits.'\n We agree with the conclusion reached by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Its judgment must be affirmed.\n Counsel for the petitioner here submit: 'The Receiver's position rests primarily upon the proposition that the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 471, 480]\n\u00a0\n circumstances surrounding the giving of the note-guaranty bonds by Cliff to the Bank accompanied by the supporting powers of attorney, ... and the consequences which followed the credence given to said bonds and powers of attorney by the national bank examiners and the Comptroller, acting as the representatives of the depositors and other creditors, give rise, in a suit by the Receiver to enforce the bonds, to an estoppel which precludes the Surety Company from denying the validity of the bonds and from asserting as a defense that its agent acted fraudulently and without authority in executing the bonds and that a fraudulent official of the Bank knew of the agent's misconduct.'\n An examination of the pleadings makes it quite clear that the receiver undertook to set up rights acquired by the insolvent bank through duly executed contracts between it and the surety company. He makes no suggestion of a purpose attributable to the company to mislead creditors or others; makes no allegations of damage, except that sustained by the bank. He sets up no facts which would render unconscionable a denial of liability upon the bond because of the agent's fraud obviously induced by the president of the bank. In this state of the pleadings the receiver may not have judgment; he cannot rely on something not complained of; nor can he have damages because of supposed deceptions which the pleadings fail to suggest.\n In Rankin v. City National Bank, \n208 \nU.S. 541, 545\n, 546 S., 28 S.Ct. 346, 348, a suit by the receiver of the Capitol National Bank of Guthrie to recover the amount of an alleged deposit where it appeared 'that the whole business, from beginning to end, was and was intended to be, a mere juggle with books and paper to deceive the bank examiner,' this Court denied the receiver's claim and said: 'If the Guthrie bank had sued while it was a going concern, it could not have recovered, and the receiver stands no bet- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 471, 481]\n\u00a0\n ter than the bank.' We adhere to the doctrine there approved and regard it as decisive of the present cause.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK (dissenting).\n When two or more persons have jointly perpetrated a fraud with intent to injure others, justice and law combine to entitle injured parties to recover from any or all of the conspirators. Corporations can act only through agents. When, as here, two corporations, acting through authorized agents, have jointly perpetrated a fraud which was intended to-and did- injure others, a just rule of law should likewise hold both corporations jointly and severally responsible for the damages inflicted by them upon innocent parties.\n In this case innocent depositors and other creditors of a now insolvent national bank suffered damages as a direct result of fraud willfully perpetrated on them by joint action of the bank and the respondent surety corporation, acting through their agents. Because of the guilty participation of the bank president in this fraud, the opinion just read denies the receiver of the insolvent bank a recovery which would inure to the benefit of the innocent depositors. At the same time, however, the respondent surety corporation is freed from any responsibility to these innocent parties, in spite of the admitted guilty participation of its agent. That the agent of the respondent surety corporation was authorized to write the indemnity bonds used in the fraud is disclosed by the findings of the master and auditor-acting 'under a stipulation that findings of fact shall be final.' These findings show that:\n The duly licensed agent of the surety company (respondent) conspired with the president of the bank to \n\n[303 \nU.S. 471, 482]\n\u00a0\n supply indemnity bonds guaranteeing the payment of certain notes held by the bank, which bonds were to be placed among the assets of the bank for the purpose of deciving federal bank examiners, the bank's directors, and all others entitled to inquire as to the soundness of the notes; the surety company's agent also personally assured the examiners that the bonds were all right; no premium was paid the surety company and the bonds were intended by the respondent's duly authorized agent and the president of the bank to be valueless and used as 'window dressings' to accomplish deceptions; respondent's duly licensed agent had a power of attorney 'to make, execute and deliver ... for and on its behalf as surety, and and all bonds ... undertakings, or anything in the nature of any of them , ... to all intents and purposes as if same had been duly executed and acknowledged by the regularly clected officers of the company ...'; a copy of the power of attorney was attached to the bonds and the examiners inspected public records and verified the authenticity of this power of attorney; these bonds were executed after the examiners had notified the bank to make good an impairment of capital and the execution of these bonds caused the Comptroller to withdraw his order to make good the impairment, and as a result the bank continued to remain open, assumed additional obligations, and accepted further deposits in large amounts.\n Since the receiver represents the creditors as well as the bank1 he can sue in his own name to recover assets \n\n[303 \nU.S. 471, 483]\n\u00a0\n on behalf of the bank or its creditors. 2 'It is the duty of the receiver of an insolvent corporation to take steps to set aside transactions which fraudulently or illegally reduce the assets available for the general creditors, even though the corporation itself was not in a position to do so.' Texas & Pacific Railway v. Pottorff, \n291 \nU.S. 245, 261\n, 54 S.Ct. 416, 420. There is no occasion to consider whether the bank could recover against the insurance company on the indemnity bonds. 'Enough that the receiver has the requisite capacity.' McCandless v. Furlaud, \n296 \nU.S. 140, 160\n, 56 S.Ct. 41, 47. In the McCandless Case, \n296 \nU.S. 140\n, at page 171, 56 S.Ct. 41, 52, the minority view was that 'the receiver's rights could rise no higher' than the corporation's rights. The majority rejected this viewpoint (at page 159, of 296 U.S., 56 S.Ct. 41, 47), holding that where corporate officers and shareholders combined with others to despoil a corporation, recovery could be had 'either by the creditors directly or in their behalf by a receiver.'\n The receiver does not merely represent the corporation-the bank. The object of the appointment of a receiver is to collect and protect all of the insolvent's assets in the interest of the creditors first, then for the benefit of the stockholders. It has long been recognized that even in the case of a going bank the rights of depositors and the public would be jeopardized unless given protection in addition to that afforded by the bank's officers elected by the stockholders. For that reason, among others, the government has provided a system of examination for all national banks. 3 Statutes require banks to make reports to the Comptroller of the Currency and to permit examinations by federal bank examiners. These examinations are designed to prevent such frauds as were perpetrated in this case. This objective will be frustrated if surety companies-with complete immunity-can, through their authorized agents, conspire with bank offi- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 471, 484]\n\u00a0\n cials to deceive and trick bank examiners. The convenient fiction that knowledge of an officer of the bank is imputed to the bank itself is not sufficient to relieve respondent surety company from the consequences of the wrong committed by its authorized agent. There is not even a fiction under which knowledge can be imputed to innocent depositors. Strange, indeed, it is if the elaborate system of precautions provided by the government to protect the interests of creditors of national banks by examination and visitation of federal officials must be held for naught by application of the fiction that the bank-not the injured depositors-knew everything its president knew. The interests of the bank and the interests of the depositors and creditors are not always identical. That their interests are recognized as separate and distinguishable is amply shown by laws passed to protect depositors and creditors of national banks. Public solicitude for protection of depositors is exemplified by the recent passage of the law insuring public deposits. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The receiver filed suits at law side to recover on the several indemnity bonds. The surety company proceeded in equity praying cancellation of the bonds. All actions were tried on evidence before a master and auditor 'under a stipulation that findings of fact shall be final.' These findings set forth all of the rights of the receiver as the representative of the creditors, the stockholders, and the bank.\n In this case, the principles involved are of great importance. The decree below adjudged the indemnity bonds to be void and unenforceable. Since I believe the receiver was entitled under these actions to enforce the bonds and to protect the innocent victims of fraud, I would reverse the decree below.\n Mr. Justice REED concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Declaration.\n Now comes the plaintiff in the above-entitled action and says that on December 22, 1931, he was appointed receiver of Boston-Continental National Bank by the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States, that he duly qualified and is now acting as such receiver.\n And the plaintiff says that the defendant duly entered into, executed under seal and delivered to the Continental National Bank of Boston, now known as Boston-Continental National Bank, a written instrument or bond, copy whereof is hereto annexed marked 'A' and hereby made a part hereof; that by the terms of said bond the defendant bound itself to pay said Continental National Bank of Boston the sum of forty thousand dollars ($40, 000) in the event that four notes of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) each signed by Westchester Discount Corporation were not paid upon the due dates as set forth in said bond, the last due date being April 20, 1931; that some time prior to April 20, 1931, said bond was extended to June 20, 1931, by a written instrument called endorsement, copy whereof is hereto annexed marked 'B'; that some time prior to June 20, 1931 said bond was extended to December 20, 1931 by a written instrument called endorsement, copy whereof is hereto annexed marked 'C'; that the condition of said bond as extended as aforesaid has been broken in that Westchester Discount Corporation, the principal named therein, has not paid the notes described in said bonds according to their terms, but on the contrary has failed, refused and declined to pay said notes and still continues so to refuse, notwithstanding the fact that all times have elapsed and all conditions have been fulfilled necessary to entitle the plaintiff to payment in full of said notes; that the defendant was duly notified of the default in accordance with the provisions of the bond; \n that the damages sustained by the plaintiff on account of the default of said Westchester Discount Corporation are in excess of forty thousand dollars ($40,000).\n Wherefore, the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in the penal sum of said bond with interest from December 20, 1931.\n And the plaintiff says that this is an action at law arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States and is a case for winding up the affairs of said Boston-Continental National Bank; and the District Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts has original jurisdiction under Section 24 of the Judicial Code of the United States.\n (Signed.)

The defendant Westchester Discount Corporation is a corporation established and existing under the laws of the State of New York having its usual place of business in Mount Vernon in the County of Westchester and State of New York. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The plaintiff is informed and believes and therefore avers that on or about December 20th, A.D. 1930 the defendant Westchester Discount Corporation and one Percy G. Cliff executed an instrument a copy of which is hereto annexed marked A and made a part hereof, and at the same time the defendant bank executed and delivered to said Cliff an instrument entitled 'Release' a copy of which is hereto annexed marked B and made a part hereof. \n Thereafter, so the plaintiff is informed and believes and therefore avers, the said Cliff executed the instruments entitled 'Endorsements' copies of which marked respectively C. and D. are hereto annexed and made parts hereof. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The plaintiff is informed and believes and therefore avers that all of the instruments aforesaid marked A.C. and D. were executed by said Cliff at the request and solicitation of the defendants without any consideration or security, without premium charged or paid or intended to be charged or paid therefor, upon the understanding between the defendants and said Cliff that said instruments were not binding obligations of the plaintiff, and upon the assurance and promise given by the defendants to said Cliff and upon the understanding that said instruments would not be used or enforced by said bank against the plaintiff, that the plaintiff should never be informed of the existence thereof, and that after remaining in the custody of the defendant bank for a short time they should be returned to said Cliff.\n 4This footnote can be found on p.476. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] All of the instruments above described copies of which are hereto annexed marked A.C. and D. were executed by the said Cliff without authority from the plaintiff and without its knowledge or consent, as both defendants well knew. The plaintiff has only recently learned of the existence of said instruments which are now in the possession of the defendant bank.\n Wherefore the plaintiff prays: \n[\nFootnote 1\n] That the defendants be enjoined from enforcing or attempting to enforce the said instruments marked A.C. and D. or any of them by suit or otherwise. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] That the said instruments marked A.C. and D. be declared null and void and that the defendant bank be ordered to deliver them up to be cancelled. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] For such other and further relief as may be necessary and proper.\n (Signed.)

Robert G. Bosworth and Winston S. Howard, both of Denver, Colo., for appellants.\n Mr. Wendell Berge, of Washington, D.C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n November 8, 1934, the Secretary of Agriculture initiated proceedings in which, February 17, 1937, after extended investigation, taking of much evidence and full hearing, he made findings of fact and an order, prescribing maximum rates to be charged by appellant for services \n\n[304 \nU.S. 470, 472]\n\u00a0\n rendered by it. \n1\n March 9, 1937, it commenced this suit2 to set aside the order on the ground that the prescribed rates are confiscatory and that enforcement of the order would deprive the company of its property without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. Amend. 5. The case was submitted on stipulations and the evidence before the Secretary. The court made findings of fact, stated conclusions of law, announced opinion,D. C., 21 F.Supp, 83, and entered decree dismissing the bill.\n The challenged rates include marketing charges per head; they are applicable only when sales are made, and are the same without regard to the time the stock remains in the pens. These are called 'yardage charges.' Appellant makes no charge for use, as such, of pens or other facilities; its charges for feed, bedding and other services are regulated by the order. About three-fourths of the total number of animals received at the yard are sold there. Some are sold to traders, also called dealers and speculators, and held in the yard until sold again. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 470, 473]\n\u00a0\n Appellant has never made any charge against traders for resales or reweighing for sale except when the resale was through commission men. For that service, the order prescribes rates which for convenience may be referred to as 'yardage charges to traders.' Appellant's activities are not confined to services covered by the order. It unloads and loads livestock from and into cars of railroads serving the yard, and receives from the carriers compensation not regulated by the Secretary. If enforced, the order will reduce revenue from charges for yardage services by about eight and one-half per cent., and from charges for other services by about nineteen per cent.; miscellaneous revenues in a substantial amount are not affected; total revenue will be reduced by about eight and one-half per cent. \n3\n To ascertain the amount on which appellant is entitled to earn a return, the Secretary determined what land and structures were used and useful for performance of the services, and to present value of land added cost of reproduction new less depreciation of structures, and allowances on account of a bridge and sewage disposal plant being built, and working capital. The total is slightly less than $2,792,700, which the Secretary adopted as rate base. He found six and one-half per cent. to be a reasonable rate of return, $530,117 the revenue procurable if prescribed charges be put in effect, and $346,545 the operating expenses, leaving a net return of $183,572, slightly more than six and one-half per cent. on the value of the property. Appellant accepts as correct the Secretary's estimate of cost of reproduction less depreciation of property found to be used and useful, and also the allowances above men- []\n Revenues Volume from used as Rates rates Revenues a rate under under Rates from Rates factor investigation investigation prescribed Prescribed [] Yardage: Cattle: Rail 325,000 $0.35 $113,750 $0.30 $97,500 Truck-ins 75,000 .40 30,000 .35 26,250 Resales 56,000 ___ ___ .15 8,400 Bulls 850 1.00 850 1.00 850 Calves: Rail 20,000 .25 5,000 .20 4,000 Truck-ins 30,000 .27 8,100 .25 7,500 Resales 3,000 ___ ___ .10 300 Hogs: Rail 25,000 .12 3,000 .12 3,000 Directs 145,000 .12 17,400 .06 8,700 \n\n[304 \nU.S. 470, 474]\n\u00a0\n tioned.

As of right safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. Amend. 5, appellant is entitled to rates, not per se excessive and extortionate, sufficient to yield a reasonable rate of return upon the value of property used, at the time it is being used, to render the services. Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 \nU.S. 19, 41\n, 29 S.Ct. 192, 48 L.R.A.,N.S., 1134, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034; Minnesota Rate Cases, Simpson v. Shepard, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 434\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A., N.S., 1151, Ann.Cas. 1916A, 18; Bluefield Co. v. Pub. Serv.

Indianapolis Co., \n272 \nU.S. 400, 414\n, 47 S.Ct. 144, 149; Los Angeles Gas Corporation v. Railroad Comm., \n289 \nU.S. 287, 305\n, 53 S.Ct. 637, 643. But it is not entitled to have included any property not used and useful for that purpose. Cf. St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. U.S., \n298 \nU.S. 38, 56\n, 56 S.Ct. 720, 727\n\n\n The Stock Show Property Excluded. The stock show is held on property owned by appellant and is conducted by an incorporated association not organized for pecuniary profit. It continues for about one week in January of each year. The Secretary found a part of that property, which is operated by the Colorado Horse and Mule Company, to be used and useful for performance of services covered by the rates regulated by him, and included it in the rate base. He appraised the rest of the show property, which consists of 2.633 acres and improvements theren, at $ 219,033, but excluded it as not used for the performance of services covered by the rates he regulates.\n For payment of expenses of the show there is used the money received for admission to it and to other events on the property, and also some that is donated for that purpose. Appellant assumes the carrying charges, including interest and taxes; when the show is unable to pay rental sufficient to cover all charges, appellant ab- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 470, 476]\n\u00a0\n sorbs the deficit. It requested findings in substance as follows: Large quantities of livestock are entered in the show and much is sold on the show property. Some is sold in the yards operated by appellant. The show attracts buyers and throughout the year widens the outlet for producers' stock, operates to increase receipts, makes for improvement of stock raised and for higher prices, has educational value, and advertises the market. It is supported by appellant in good faith and in the belief that it stimulates its business and that of livestock producers. These facts are not in substantial conflict with the Secretary's findings, and may be taken as established by the evidence. But they are not sufficient to prove that the property excluded is used and useful for the performance of services covered by rates being regulated by the Secretary. None of those services is performed on or by the use of any of that property. The Secretary rightly says 'If it is appellant's contention that the stock show increases the stockyard business, then it should request that a reasonable allowance be made for advertising expense as a charge against its income.' In support of that view he adds 'Advertising or developmental expenses to foster normal growth are legitimate charges upon income for rate purposes if confined within the limits of reason. West Ohio Gas Co. v. Utilities Comm., \n294 \nU.S. 63\n, 72 (55 S.Ct. 316, 321).' Appellant's contention that the court erred in upholding the Secretary's exclusion of that item is not sustained.\n Trackage and Unloading and Loading Facilities. The Secretary appraised that property at $177,108. He excluded it as not used for performance of any stockyard service. Appellant leases the trackage to railroad carriers for substantial rentals. It does not claim that exclusion of that part of the item is confiscatory and fails to show it prejudicial. It follows that the court did not err in upholding the Secretary's determination. The unloading \n\n[304 \nU.S. 470, 477]\n\u00a0\n and loading facilities include ways between docks and the pens where the stockyard services are rendered. Appellant uses these facilities to unload and load livestock. That is a service for which the carriers pay appellant. Stockyard services do not commence until unloading ends; they end when loading begins. See Atchison Ry. Co. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 193, 198\n, 55 S.Ct. 748, 751. The court rightly refused to disturb the Secretary's ruling as to these facilities.\n Land Value. The Secretary's finding depends on the appraisal and testimony of his valuation engineer. Appellant maintains that it is not supported by evidence because the engineer was not a qualified expert witness. It concedes that, if he was competent, the valuation must be sustained. To support its point, appellant relies on the fact that the appraiser had never lived in Denver or previously appraised any land there or in that vicinity or assembled or appraised any large industrial tracts. The significance adverse to competency that might be attributed to these facts if they stood alone is negatived by others disclosed by the record. The appraiser is an experienced civil engineer; he was long engaged in land appraisal work under the Interstate Commerce Commission. He later had private practice as consulting engineer and in 1934 became principal valuation engineer of the Packers and Stockyards Division, Bureau of Animal Industry, Department of Agriculture; in that capacity he has given testimony in a number of rate proceedings. His report submitted to the Secretary isclose  elaborate investigation and consideration of prices paid for land, of the Interstate Commerce Commission's appraisals of lands in the vicinity and of other facts material to the ascertainment of value of the land in question. It cannot reasonably be said that, because of his lack of earlier knowledge of local conditions, the finding was made without evidence. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 470, 478]\n\u00a0\n Going Concern Value. Appellant maintains that, while admitting it exists in the property, the Secretary failed to include in rate base any allowance on account of it, and that the evidence requires addition of at least $325,000 to cover that element.\n In substance, the Secretary's findings state: The stockyard is a going concern; it has a long history of efficient management and has won a reputation for good service; it has been financially successful. His valuation engineer (whose figures and valuation are the basis of the Secretary's appraisal) considered going concern value but did not include a separate amount for it. In adopting the value of the land and the cost of reproduction new less depreciation of structures, consideration was given to the element of going concern value. Adequate allowance has been included, although no separate item on its account has been set forth. The findings contain a 'summary of the value of used and useful land, the cost of reproduction new of structures and equipment, including direct construction overheads, indirect overheads, interest on used and useful land during construction, and working capital, and the cost of these, less depreciation where depreciation exists, of respondent (appellant) as a going concern. \n4\n ... It is found that the fair value of the property of respondent as a going concern is $2,792,681. ...'\n[]\n Cost of Cost of Condition Reproduction Reproduction Per Cent.

Assuming that to be true, it does not follow that the Secretary failed to include proper allowance for going concern. Dayton P. & L. Co. v. Utilities Comm., \n292 \nU.S. 290, 309\n, 54 S.Ct. 647, 656. The value of appellant's property used in stockyard services is single in substance. West v. Chesapeake & P. Tel. Co., \n295 \nU.S. 662, 672\n, 55 S.Ct. 894, 898. While it may be considered as made up of tangible and intangible elements, it is not necessarily to be appraised by adding to cost figures attributable to mere physical plant something to cover the value of the business. Kennebec Water District v. Waterville, 97 Me. 185, 220, 54 A. 6, 60 L.R.A. 856. Value depends upon use and is measured, or at least significantly indicated, by the profitableness of present and prospective service rendered at rates that are just and reasonable as between the owner of and those served by the property. Cleveland, etc., Railway Co., v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 439, 445\n, 14 S.Ct. 1122; National Waterworks Co. v. Kansas City, 8 Cir., 62 F. 853, 864-866, 27 L.R.A. 827; Omaha v. Omaha Water Co., \n218 \nU.S. 180, 202\n, 30 S.Ct. 615, 48 L.R.A.,N.S., 1084; Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, \n238 \nU.S. 153, 165\n, 35 S.Ct. 811; Denver v.

It is elementary that value of a going concern may be less than, equal to, or more than, present cost of plant less depreciation plus necessary supplies and working capital. See Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 \nU.S. 388, 396\n, 42 S.Ct. 351, 355; Los Angeles Gas Corporation v. Railroad Comm., supra, 313, 314, 53 S.Ct. 647. Dayton P. & L. Co. v. Utilities Comm., ubi supra. Appellant's plant without business, present or prospective, would be worth much less than the cost figures found by the Secretary to represent value. Appellant's claim, that the rate base includes nothing on account of going concern value, is without foundation in fact.\n The considerations upon which appellant claimed to have established an amount to be added to rate base to \n\n[304 \nU.S. 470, 480]\n\u00a0\n cover going value may be summarily stated: (1) The sales charge is for the privilege of the market. The value of the market is not reflected in reproduction cost of structures. It is over and above value of or investment in plant. (2) Appellant has spent large sums and made gifts of money and land as a result of which large packers have their plants at Denver and buy on appellant's market. (3) Cattle of various owners arriving at the Denver market by rail for the same market session from different shipping points may be sorted into uniform carloads to move to another destination on the through rate from point of shipment to point of destination. The privilege is not open at Chicago or any Missouri River market. (4) A high percentage of the stock received at appellant's yard is sold there; this percentage has progressively increated. (5) Volume, appraised at $10 per car, applied to the 35,000 cars annually received at the yard.\n None of these considerations has much, if any, bearing on the ascertainment of going value or the application of the rule that it is to be taken into account in confiscation cases. That element is not separate from or necessarily in excess of reasonable cost figures attributable to the plant. The Secretary considered its location, the volume and flow of shipments, percentages of sales to receipts, privileges in transit, cost of service, past history, future prospects, and other pertinent facts. Appellant does not claim that its past operations clearly reflect excellence of service and low cost per unit in comparison with results attained by other stockyards, or that conditions affecting performance give dependable assurance of future growth and capacity to earn net returns at relatively low rates. See e.g. McCardle v. Indianapolis Co., supra, 413-415, 47 S.Ct. 149, 150. Its evidence falls far short of condemning as arbitrary and confiscatory the Secre- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 470, 481]\n\u00a0\n tary's refusal to add a separate amount to his rate base to cover going concern value.\n Yardage Charges to Traders. These are prescribed as reasonable maximum rates to cover sales for which, as above stated, appellant has made no charge. Its failure so to do is found by the Secretary and the lower court to be unreasonably and unjustly discriminatory, in that it does make charges for similar privileges it furnishes producers and others selling in its market. The prescribed charges apply to animals sold by producers or others to traders and by the latter resold or reweighed for sale at the yard. On cattle, calves and hogs they are 50 per cent. of those charged producers, on sheep and goats 40 per cent, and on horses, mules and purebred bulls, 100 per cent. The Secretary estimates that if appellant exacts the prescribed charges to traders it will obtain revenue from that source of $10,960 per year, and he includes that amount in his calculation of reasonable return.\n There is controversy between the parties as to space assigned to traders and details of service attributable to sales by them. But the evidence clearly shows that, as found by the Secretary and lower courts, appellant does provide them facilities and privileges similar to, though not precsely th e same as, those furnished to others making sales in the market. These charges are not discriminatory as between producers; they directly bear but one charge. Assuming that the charge for selling by traders would operate to lessen prices obtainable by producers from them, no unjust discrimination results, for obviously charges for the two sales of the same animals reasonably may be more than that exacted for the first one. These rates are prescribed, and revenues obtainable from them are included by the Secretary in his estimate of appellant's income, to the end that it may not exact from producers and others selling at the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 470, 482]\n\u00a0\n yard charges sufficient to cover the part of its operating expenses that is fairly attributable to the sales made by traders. The statute denounces unjust discrimination and requires appellant as a public market to charge, and empowers the Secretary to prescribe, rates that are non-discriminatory. There is no ground for the appellant's suggestion to the effect that the order unlawfully invades its right as owner to manage the yard and control its business policy. Cf. Interstate Commerce Comm. v. Chicago G. W. Ry. Co ., \n209 \nU.S. 108, 118\n, 28 S.Ct. 493; Norfolk & W. Ry. Co. v. Conley, Atty. Gen., of West Virginia, \n236 \nU.S. 605, 609\n, 35 S.Ct. 437; Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, \n236 \nU.S. 585, 595\n, 596 S., 35 S.Ct. 429, L.R.A. 1917F, 1148, Ann.Cas.1916A, 1; Banton v. Belt Line Ry. Corporation, \n268 \nU.S. 413, 421\n, 45 S.Ct. 534, 537.\n Dues, Donations and Subscriptions. Appellant claims an allowance in operating expenses of $3,000 to $4,000 a year. The Secretary found that it has regularly made disbursements ranging between those figures to local charities, philanthropies, civic organizations, etc. \n5\n He held that only those of peculiar benefit to respondent's employees and patrons should be included, and on that basis allowed in estimated future operating expenses $ 325 a year. Appellant says that the exclusion leaves return about $1,000 short of six and one-half per cent., that no contributions were made to charities which did not carry \n\n[304 \nU.S. 470, 483]\n\u00a0\n on in the stockyards area, and that nearly all other items were business expenses.\n But decision here cannot be made to turn on an estimated margin relatively so small. Appellant's annual receipts and sales at the yard vay consi derably. Operating expenses may be less or more per head than the estimates therefor. Property value may deline or advance. None of the expenditures in question is compulsory. Appellant may withhold dues, donations or subscriptions as it sees fit. It was not, and probably could not have been, proved that failure to respond would adversely affect its revenue. The Secretary is not required to prescribe rates so low as to be barely sufficient to withstand attack on the ground of confiscation, but is at liberty within limits that he may find to be just and reasonable to establish higher rates. Banton v. Belt Line Ry. Corporation, supra, 422, 45 S.Ct. 537; Dayton P. & L. Co. v. Utilities Comm., supra, 308, 54 S.Ct. 655; Columbus Gas Co. v. Utilities Comm., \n292 \nU.S. 398, 414\n, 54 S.Ct. 763, 770, 91 A.L.R. 1403; Atlantic Coast Line Co. v. Florida, \n295 \nU.S. 301, 317\n, 55 S.Ct. 713, 719. Cf. Dayton-Goose Creek Ry. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456, 484\n, 44 S.Ct. 169, 174, 33 A.L.R. 472. In view of the variable elements to which appellant's prospective income is subject, its control over the items in controversy, and their triviality, we find it unnecessary to decide whether appellant as of constitutional right is entitled to have any of them included in its future operating expenses. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 470, 484]\n\u00a0\n Expenses of Hearings under the Act. The Secretary found it reasonable to include in estimated operating costs some of the expenses incident to future hearings under the act, suggested that they will be less than heretofore, and allowed $100 a month. The court below reached the same conclusion. Appellant does not attack this allowance as insufficient to cover expense on account of future hearings. Here, it complains that nothing is included 'to amortize over a reasonable future period or at all the costs and expenses of the present litigation'.\n But we are not called on to decide that question. Appellant's bill challenges the Secretary's allowance, refers to expenses theretofore incurred in rate investigations and alleges that the allowance 'is wholly inadequate to permit petitioner (appellant) either to reimburse itself for expenditures forced upon it by the Secretary or to meet probable reasonable expenditures for said purposes in the future, and that the ... finding ... is arbitrary ...'. At the trial the Secretary, without conceding materiality of the facts, stipulated that expense of the present proceeding from its commencement, about January 1, 1935, to the date of the order was $24,654.27 and that a reasonable estimate of the expense of litigation in the lower court was $15,785. Appellant requested the court to find that its average annual expense on account of hearings under the Act for the five-year period ending with 1934 was $8,786.88, and to find the facts stipulated by the Secretary and that its average annual expense on account of enforcement of the Act for the eleven-year period ending with 1934 was $6,216.\n The burden was on appellant by direct allegations plainly to set forth the facts on which it intended at the trial to maintain that the rates are confiscatory. Aetna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, \n275 \nU.S. 440, 447\n, 48 S.Ct. 174, 176, and cases there cited; New Orleans Public Service Co. v. New Orleans, \n281 \nU.S. 682, 686\n, 50 S.Ct. 449, 450; Beaumont, S.L. & W. Ry. Co. v. U. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 470, 485]\n\u00a0\n S., \n282 \nU.S. 74, 88\n, 89 S., 51 S.Ct. 1, 6, 7; Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Norwood, \n283 \nU.S. 249, 255\n, 51 S.Ct. 458, 461. Its complaint failed to disclose the claim it now makes. It is that for each of the five years following the effective date of the order, there should be added to estimated cost of operation about $8,000 to cover expenses of hearings before the Secretary and of litigation in the District Court. Its request for finding was not sufficient to present the question. Probable expense of future hearings being in issue, the Secretary's stipulation as to actual cost of past hearings and probable exense of future litigation cannot be regarded as consent to litigate the question of amortization not raised by the bill. As the issue was not appropriately presented below, appellant is not entitled to have it decided here.\n Rate of Return. Upon consideration of the testimony of the Secretary's economist and a local investment banker of high standing, who is also a stockholder and director of appellant, the Secretary and lower court found that six and one-half per cent. per annum of the value of the property is a reasonable return. We need not restate the considerations to be taken into account in determining a reasonable rate of return. \n6\n Plainly the evidence is not sufficient to require or warrant a finding that in the immediate future a return of six and one-half per cent. on the value of the property will be confiscatory.\n The judgment of the District Court must be affirmed. It is so ordered.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n Mr. Justice BLACK concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 7 U.S.C.  211, 7 U.S.C.A.  211.

Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, \n302 \nU.S. 464\n, 58 S.Ct. 300. The respondents are essentially the same, with the addition of Greenwood County, in the state of South Carolina, and the members of the finance board of the county. The suit was brought to enjoin the construction and operation of a local electric power plant in the county, and the making of a loan and grant by the federal administrator to the county, for that purpose, under the provisions of title 2 of the National Industrial Recovery Act,  201 et seq., 40 U.S.C.A.  401 et seq., set forth, so far as material, in Nos. 84 and 85, supra.\n The case was here on a previous writ, upon consideration of which this court, because of substantial irregularities in practice, reversed the judgment of the court below with directions to vacate the decrees entered by the District Court, and remand the cause to that court with directions to permit the parties to amend their pleadings in the light of existing facts, and retry the cause upon the issues then presented. We expressed no opinion upon the merits or the relevancy or effect of the evidence. \n299 \nU.S. 259\n, 57 S.Ct. 202. Accordingly, the case was remanded to \n\n[302 \nU.S. 485, 490]\n\u00a0\n the District Court, and reheard. The District Court, after making findings of fact and conclusions of law, dismissed the bill. The court below, upon appeal, considered the case fully, and delivered an exhaustive opinion. It held (1) that the statute, under which the administrator proposed to act, was constitutional; (2) that he acted within the power granted him by the statute; and (3) that in any event no legal right of plaintiffs was violated by what had been done. 4 Cir., 91 F.2d 665; see, also, preceding decision, 4 Cir., 81 F.2d 986.\n Upon the question of petitioners' standing to maintain the suit, the lower court held, in substance, that the competition proposed by the county was lawful and that even though the administrator were without authority to make the proposed loan and grant, no legal right of petitioners was thereby invaded. The opinion upon this branch of the case is in harmony with the views we have just expressed in Nos. 84 and 85; and it follows that the decree must be, and it is, affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BLACK concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nELECTRIC BOND & SHARE CO. v.

These sections provide for registration with the Commission of holding companies, as defined, section 5(a), 15 U.S.C.A.  79e(a), and prohibit the use of the mails and the instrumentalities of interstate commerce to those companies which fail to register. Section 4(a ), 15 U.S.C.A.  79d(a). Section 5(b), 15 U.S.C.A.  79e(b), provides for the filing of a registration statement giving information with respect to the organization, financial structure and nature of the business of the registrant, together with various details of operations.\n Defendants, including interveners, contested the validity of these provisions and sought by cross-bill a declaratory judgment that the act was invalid in its entirety, 15 U.S.C.A.  79 et seq., as being in excess of the powers granted to Congress by section 8 of article 1, and in violation of section 1 of article 1 and of the Fifth and Tenth Amendments, of the Constitution of the United States. The District Court sustained the validity of sections 4(a) and 5, and granted an injunction accordingly. The cross-bill was dismissed for want of equity and for lack of any actual controversy within the meaning of the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act of 1934, Jud.Code,  274d, as amended, 28 U.S.C.A.  400. D.C., 18 F.Supp. 131, 139. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. 2 Cir., 92 F. 2d 580. Certiorari was granted. \n302 \nU.S. 681\n, 58 S.Ct. 411, 82 L.Ed. --.\n The suit was brought against the Electric Bond & Share Company and fourteen associated public utility companies. Of these, it appears that seven have ceased to be holding companies within the meaning of the act, two1 before the cause was heard by the District Court and five2 since the decree. The remaining companies against whom the decree of injunction runs are Electric Bond & Share Company, American Gas & Electric \n\n[303 \nU.S. 419, 428]\n\u00a0\n Company, American Power & Light Company, National Power & Light Company, Electric Power & Light Corporation, Lehigh Power Securities Corporation, Utah Power & Light Company, and Pacific Power & Light Company.\n The decree provides in substance, as to each of these defendants, that after a day specified and until such defendant shall cease to be a holding company as defined in the act, section 2, 15 U.S.C.A.  79b, or shall register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as provided in section 5(a), 15 U.S.C.A.  79e(a), it shall not carry on any of the activities in interstate commerce or through the mails which are forbidden to nonregistered holding companies by paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), and ( 6) of section 4(a), 15 U.S.C.A.  79d(1-4, 6). The provisions of sections 4(a) and 5 are set forth in the margin. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 419, 429]\n\u00a0\n The decree further provides that the injunction and the dismissal of the cross bill shall be without prejudice 'to any rights or remedies in law or in equity' which defendants may have after registration, and leaves defendants free to challenge the validity of any of the provisions of the act other than sections 4(a) and 5. The dismissal of the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 419, 430]\n\u00a0\n cross-appeal is also declared to be without prejudice 'to any rights or remedies in law or in equity' which the intervening defendants 'may have or be entitled to upon the act \n\n[303 \nU.S. 419, 431]\n\u00a0\n being made applicable to them by the registration of any holding company of which they are subsidiary companies.' All rights of defendants, including interveners, are thus fully reserved with respect to the application to them of any provision of the act outside of those contained in the particular sections which are enforced by the decree.\n Petitioners insist that the act is invalid as a whole; that the provisions of sections 4(a) and 5 are not separable from the remainder; that these provisions, if separately considered, do not constitute a valid regulation of interstate commerce and the mails; and that the cross-bill presented a controversy upon the merits of which the defendants, including interveners, were entitled to the judgment of the court.\n First. The initial question is whether the defendant companies, against which the decree for injunction runs, are engaged in activities which bring them within the ambit of congressional authority. Upon this point there seems to be no serious controversy, and for the purpose of the present decision we do not find it necessary to make a comprehensive statement of the corporate setup and operations of the respective defendants. The facts were fully set forth in an elaborate stipulation which underlay the findings of fact of the trial court. A brief statement addressed to the point now under consideration will suffice.\n Electric Bond & Share Company is styled in the findings as 'the top holding company' in 'a holding-company system' in which all the other defendants and intervening defendants together with numerous other companies are subsidiaries. Electric Bond & Share Company owns substantial minorities of the voting stocks \n\n[303 \nU.S. 419, 432]\n\u00a0\n of the defendants American Gas & Electric Company, American Power & Light Company, National Power & Light Company, and Electric Power & Light Corporation. These companies in turn own directly or through subholding companies substantial majorities, in some cases approximating complete ownership and in all cases sufficient to insure voting control, of the common stocks of operating gas and electric utilities. The 'electric operations' of subsidiaries in the Bond & Share system are conducted in thirty-two states. Some operate only within a single state, some in two or more states, transmitting energy across state lines for their own account, and some sell energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.\n Until shortly prior to the institution of this suit Electric Bond & Share Company rendered services to both holding and operating companies under service contracts. After the approval of the act, it formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Ebasco Services Incorporated, to take over the servicing of the operating companies and the servicing of the holding companies was discontinued. The performance of service contracts by Ebasco, operating as a subsidiary and on behalf of Electric Bond & Share Company, constitutes an extensive business in rendering continuous expert, specialized, and technical service, advice, and assistance to the serviced companies upon every phase of the utility enterprise. Phoenix Engineering Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ebasco, performs construction work for subsidiary public-utility companies in the Bond & Share system. The American Gas & Electric Company also performs services for subsidiary operating companies.\n We need not go further in the description of the operations of these companies, as petitioners concede that the carrying out of these service contracts, as found by the trial court, involves continuous and extensive use of the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 419, 433]\n\u00a0\n mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, although petitioners are careful to qualify the concession by saying that they agree with the trial court that 'this is not to say that the entire business of Ebasco or American Gas constitutes interstate commerce and is therefore subject to unlimited federal regulation.'\n Petitioners also state with respect to American Power & Light Company, National Power & Light Company, and Electric Power & Light Corporation, that while it is insisted that these are simply investment holding companies and that their business as such is not interstate commerce, they may 'from time to time engage in transactions in interstate commerce or may use the instrumentalities of interstate commerce in particular transactions, such as the distribution of securities, in such manner that those particular activities become the subject of federal regulation.'\n The trial court found that one or more subsidiary electric-utility companies of Lehigh Power Securities Corporation 'are regularly engaged in selling, purchasing, or transmitting some electric energy across state lines'; and that Utah Power & Light Company and Pacific Power & Light Company are both holding companies and electric-utility companies; and that the transmission of electric energy across state lines is part of the enterprise of each.\n In the light of the findings supported by the stipulation, we perceive no ground for a conclusion that the defendant companies which are enjoined are not engaged in activities within the reach of the congressional power.\n Second. Challenging the validity of the act in its entirety, petitioners contend that sections 4(a) and 5, 15 U.S.C.A.  79d(a), 79e, cannot be separated from the other provisions of the act and thus be separately sustained and enforced. They urge that these sections are purely auxiliary to the subsequent or 'control provisions' of the act, sections 6 to 13, 15 U.S.C.A.  79f to 79m; that the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 419, 434]\n\u00a0\n object of this suit is to compel submission to an integrated system of control and that the sole question is whether the act as a whole, 'or enough to accomplish its general plan,' is constitutional. They insist that this question must be determined before they may be compelled to register.\n\n\n (1)\n In this branch of the case, petitioners address their argument to the intent of Congress, rather than to its power. But Congress has defined its intent as to separability. Section 32 of the act, 15 U.S.C.A.  79z-6, provides: 'If any provision of this title (chapter)4 or the application of such provision to any person or circumstances shall be held invalid, the remainder of the title (chapter) and the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid shall not be affected thereby.'\n This provision reverses the presumption of inseparability-that the Legislature intended the act to be effective as an entirety or not at all. Congress has established the opposite presumption of divisibility. Williams v. Standard Oil Co., \n278 \nU.S. 235, 242\n, 49 S.Ct. 115, 117, 60 A.L.R. 596; Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165, 184\n, 52 S.Ct. 548, 553; Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 210, 235\n, 52 S.Ct. 559, 565, 86 A.L.R. 403. Congress has thus said that the statute is not an integrated whole, which as such must be sustained or held invalid. On the contrary, when validity is in question, divisibility and not integration is the guiding principle. Invalid parts are to be excised and the remainder enforced. When we are seeking to ascertain the congressional purpose, we must give heed to this explicit declaration.\n\n\n (2)\n It is evident that the provisions of sections 4(a) and 5 are not so interwoven with the other provisions of the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 419, 435]\n\u00a0\n act that there is any inherent or practical difficulty in the separation and independent enforcement of the former while reserving all questions as to the validity of the latter. The administrative construction of the statute was formulated in that view. Rule 4 of the Commission provided that any person, in filing any statement under the act, might include an express reservation of constitutional and legal rights. It was on the basis of that construction that this suit was prosecuted and was limited to the enforcement of sections 4(a) and 5. All rights and remedies as to all other provisions of the act are, as we have seen, expressly reserved to the defendants by the decree. Nor can it be said that this reservation is illusory. If this decree is affirmed, it will constitute a specific adjudication that registration will be without prejudice to future challenge of the validity of any provision of the act, or requirement of the Commission, outside of sections 4(a) and 5. It is idle to contend that registration pursuant to the decree will subject the defendants to the act as an integrated whole or bring into operation against them what the decree expressly excludes.\n\n\n (3)\n Although there is no practical obstacle to the separate enforcement of the provisions of sections 4(a) and 5, the argument is pressed that in reason and design there is an essential unity of these provisions and the so-called 'control provisions' which forbids such enforcement. Petitioners urge that sections 4(a) and 5 'merely implement the system of controls'; that the policy of the act as declared in section 1(c), 15 U.S.C.A.  79a(c), is to compel 'the simplification and the elimination of holding company systems'; and that the objective cannot be attained by informatory processes but only by such regulation or control as will 'eliminate' the evils.\n The Government replies that while the other provisions are applicable only to registered companies and their subsidiaries, sections 4(a) and 5 are drafted so as to be opera- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 419, 436]\n\u00a0\n tive independently and that the registration provisions themselves constitute 'an effective instrument of informatory regulation.' 'If, for example,' argues the Government, 'section 11 (15 U.S.C.A.  79k) dealing with corporate reorganizations were adjudged invalid, there is no inherent reason why the other regulatory provisions could not be enforced as the Congress provided. And if section 13 (15 U.S.C.A.  79m) dealing with service contracts were adjudged invalid, there is no inherent reason why the registration provisions, or sections 6 and 7 (15 U.S.C.A.  79f, 79g) regulating security issues, or sections 8, 9 and 10 (15 U.S.C.A.  79h to 79j) dealing with utility acquisitions, could not be administered in accordance with their terms.' 'Likewise,' it is said,' 'the purpose and effect of the registration provision-regulation by the informatory process- are the same whether registration is considered as a separate statute regulating utility holding companies, or as but one part of a comprehensive statute containing many different regulations of utility holding compenies.' Moreover, as observed by the District Court, section 1( c) in its entirety negatives any conclusion that the simplification and elimination of holding companies 'is the sole policy or the whole end and object of the act, which, as stated, is 'to meet the problems and eliminate the evils as enumerated in this section, connected with public- utility holding companies,\" and thus 'simplification and elimination' are but a means and not 'the exclusive means' deemed to be essential for the purpose of effectuating such policy 'in whole or in so far as may be constitutionally possible.'\n We think that the manner in which the act is framed and the variety of provisions it contains, when viewed in the light of the presumption of divisibility, justify that conclusion. The fact that registration underlies the application of subsequent requirements of the statute does not prevent the provisions of sections 4(a) and 5 from having a purpose and a value of their own. Section 5 not only \n\n[303 \nU.S. 419, 437]\n\u00a0\n provides in paragraph (a) for the filing of a 'notification of registration,' but also requires by paragraph (b) every registered holding company to submit, within a reasonable time after registration, a 'registration statement' containing a variety of detailed information as to corporate structure and activities. Thus section 5(b) is itself a 'control' provision, which is immediately operative. The duty to supply the described information is separately and definitely prescribed.\n It cannot be denied that a requirement of this sort is a regulation which Congress could have regarded as important in itself and could have made the subject of a separate statute. The fact that it is found in a statute imposing other regulations, or that it precedes the application of the others, does not deprive it of its essential character and its capacity to stand alone. Regulation requiring the submission of information is a familiar category. Information bearing upon activities which are within the range of congressional power may be sought not only by congressional investigation as an aid to appropriate legislation, but through the continuous supervision of an administrative body. See Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 \nU.S. 447\n, 474, \n155 \nU.S. 3\n, 14 S.Ct. 1125, 15 S.Ct. 19; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Goodrich Transit Company, \n224 \nU.S. 194, 211\n, 32 S. Ct. 436; American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. United States, \n299 \nU.S. 232, 235\n, 237 S., 57 S.Ct. 170, 172. Congress may use this method in connection with a comprehensive scheme of regulation, as, for example, in the case of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Communications Commission; or Congress may employ this informatory process independently. An illustration of the latter is found in the statute relating to newspapers and periodicals, enjoying the privileges accorded to second class mail, which requires an annual statement setting forth the names and addresses of the editor, publisher, business manager, owner, and, in case of ownership by a \n\n[303 \nU.S. 419, 438]\n\u00a0\n corporation, the stockholders, and also the names of known bondholders or other security holders, together with a statement as to circulation. 39 U. S.C.  233, 39 U.S.C.A.  233. See Lewis Publishing Co. v. Morgan, \n229 \nU.S. 288\n, 33 S.Ct. 867, L.Ed. 1190\n\n\n Petitioners refer to the limitations upon publicity contained in section 22, 15 U.S.C.A.  79v, and contrast this provision with that of the Securities Act of 1933,  6(d), 48 Stat. 74, 78, 15 U.S.C.A.  77f(d). But section 22 provides that the information shall be available to the public when in the judgment of the Commission its disclosure would be in the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers. The limitations are plainly intended to safeguard particular information which may be regarded as of a private or confidential character and as not directly concerning the public interest. They do not detract from the value which may be deemed to attach to the requirement that the described information should be furnished, whether as an aid to legislation or as facilitating administrative supervision or as securing a desirable publicity.\n Both parties invoke the legislative history of the act. Petitioners contend that this shows that control, not publicity, was intended. The Government insists that the legislative history supports the presumption of separability. It is unnecessary to review the details of the arguments or the cited statements from the legislative halls. The act speaks for itself with sufficient clarity. The Government points to six groups of regulatory provisions contained in the act, viz., registration, sections 4 and 5, 15 U.S.C.A.  79d, 79e; issuance of securities, sections 6 and 7, 15 U.S.C.A.  79f, 79g; acquisition of securities and utility assets, sections 8, 9 and 10, 15 U.S.C.A.  79h to 79j; corporate simplification and reorganization, section 11, 15 U.S.C.A.  79k; service contracts and other intercompany transactions, sections 12 and 13, 15 U.S.C.A.  79l, 79m; and reports and accounts, sections 14 and 15, 15 U.S.C.A.  79n, 79o. We see nothing in the legislative history of the Act which requires the conclusion that all these groups were intended to constitute a unitary system, no part of which can fail without destroying the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 419, 439]\n\u00a0\n rest. On the contrary, we think that the intent of Congress is that these various groups of regulations, as well as particular provisions of each group should be regarded as separable so that, if any such group or provision should be found to be invalid, that invalidity should not extend to the remaining parts if by reason of their nature and as a practical matter they could be separately sustained and enforced.\n Congress provided in section 18(f), 15 U.S.C.A.  79r(f) that the Commission might bring an action to enforce compliance with the act or any rule, regulation or order thereunder, and that upon a proper showing a permanent or temporary injunction or decree should be granted. In pursuance of that authority, the present action was brought solely to enforce the provisions of sections 4(a) and 5. We find no basis for holding that these provisions cannot be separately enforced if they are valid and we turn to that question. In view of this conclusion as to separability, it is unnecessary to go through the statute in order to determine whether other provisions are valid or invalid, and we do not intimate that there would not be found in any event a workable system in addition to the registration sections.\n Third. Petitioners contend that, standing by themselves, sections 4(a) and 5 transgress constitutional restrictions. These sections have three parts. Section 5(a) provides for the filing of a notification of registration. Section 5(b) makes it the duty of every registered holding company to file a registration statement, with documents and certain detailed information, within a reasonable time after registration. Section 4(a) prescribes the penalty for failure to register under section 5. As the requirement of information is in itself a permissible and useful type of regulation (Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, supra; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Goodrich Transit Company, supra; American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. United States, supra), the question is whether the par- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 419, 440]\n\u00a0\n ticular demand, here assailed, can be validly addressed to the defendants enjoined by the decree, and, if so, whether it exceeds constitutional limits because of the character and extent of the information sought.\n The findings of the District Court based upon the stipulation of facts leave no room for doubt that these defendants are engaged in transactions in interstate commerce. That they conduct such transactions through the instrumentality of subsidiaries cannot avail to remove them from the reach of the federal power. It is the substance of what they do, and not the form in which they clothe their transactions, which must afford the test. The constitutional authority confided to Congress could not be maintained if it were deemed to depend upon the mere modal arrangements of those seeking to escape its exercise. Compare Northern Securities Company v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197\n, 24 S.Ct. 436. We need not now determine to what precise extent these defendants are actually engaged in interstate commerce. It is enough that they do have continuous and extensive operations in that commerce, and Congress cannot be denied the power to demand the information which would furnish a guide to the regulation necessary or appropriate in the national interest. Regulation is addressed to practices which appear to need supervision, correction or control. And to determine what regulation is essential or suitable, Congress is entitled to consider and to estimate whatever evils exist.\n Congress has set forth in the act what it considers to be the factual situation and the need of federal supervision. The following statement is found in paragraph (a) of section 1, 15 U.S.C.A.  79a(a): 'Public-utility holding companies and their subsidiary companies are affected with a national public interest in that, among other things, (1) their securities are widely marketed and distributed by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce and are sold to a \n\n[303 \nU.S. 419, 441]\n\u00a0\n large number of investors in different States; (2) their service, sales, construction, and other contracts and arrangements are often made and performed by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; (3) their subsidiary public-utility companies often sell and transport gas and electric energy by the use of means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; (4) their practices in respect of and control over subsidiary companies often materially affect the interstate commerce in which those companies engage; (5) their activities extending over many States are not susceptible of effective control by any State and make difficult, if not impossible, effective State regulation of public-utility companies.'\n Congress has further declared in paragraph (b) of that section, 15 U. S.C.A.  79a(b), upon the basis of facts disclosed by the reports of the Federal Trade Commission and of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives, and otherwise ascertained, the circumstances in which the national interest and the interest of investors and consumers may be adversely affected by the operation of public utility holding companies. And after this catalogue of the abuses which may exist in the circumstances described, Congress declares it to be its policy 'to meet the problems and eliminate the evils as enumerated in this section, connected with public-utility holding companies which are engaged in interstate commerce or in activities which directly affect or burden interstate commerce.' 15 U.S.C.A.  79a(c). Without attempting to state the limits of permissible regulation in the execution of this declared policy, we have no reason to doubt that from these defendants, with their highly important relation to interstate commerce and the national economy, Congress was entitled to demand the fullest information as to organization, financial structure and all the activities which could have any bearing upon the exercise of congressional authority. The regulation found in section 5(b) \n\n[303 \nU.S. 419, 442]\n\u00a0\n goes no further than to require this information and we are of the opinion that its validity must be sustained.\n Section 4(a) prescribes the penalty for failure to register under section 5, and that section as an incident to registration imposes the duty to file the described registration statement. Treating the requirements of sections 4(a) and 5 as a separable part of the act, the question is whether that penalty may be validly imposed.\n In the imposition of penalties for the violation of its rules, Congress has a wide discretion. Sanctions may be of various types. See Helvering v. Mitchell, \n303 \nU.S. 391\n, 58 S.Ct. 630, decided March 7, 1938. They may involve the loss of a privilege which would otherwise be enjoyed. Id., note 2. When Congress lays down a valid rule to govern those engaged in transactions in interstate commerce, Congress may deny to those who violate the rule the right to engage in such transactions.

And while Congress may not exercise its control over the mails to enforce a requirement which lies outside its constitutional province, when Congress lays down a valid regulation pertinent to the use of the mails, it may withdraw the privilege of that use from those who disobey. Champion v. Ames, supra; Lewis Publishing Co. v. Morgan, \n229 \nU.S. 288\n, 33 S.Ct. 867.\n In the instant case, the penalty attaches to the use of the instrumentalities of commerce and of the mails by those who, engaged in that use, refuse to submit to section 5 and thus through registration and the statement which is incident to registration to supply the information which Congress is entitled to demand, and has demanded, with respect to their organization and practices. Each one of the paragraphs of section 4( a), as related to the requirements of section 5, is addressed to those in that class. We think \n\n[303 \nU.S. 419, 443]\n\u00a0\n that the imposition of such a penalty does not transgress any constitutional provision.\n The decree enforces this penalty by injunction as the act itself authorizes. Section 18(f). The terms of the injunction follow closely the provisions of section 4(a) and do not extend beyond them. The escape the penalty and the enforcing provisions of the decree, all that the defendants have to do is to register with the Commission and assume, under section 5, the obligation to file the described registration statement. All their rights and remedies with respect to other provisions of the statute remain without prejudice. Their objections to the affirmative provisions of the decree are untenable.\n Fourth. The District Court did not err in dismissing the cross-bill. Defendants are not entitled to invoke the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act in order to obtain an advisory decree upon a hypothetical state of facts. See New Jersey v. Sargent, \n269 \nU.S. 328\n, 46 S.Ct. 122; United States v. West Virginia, \n295 \nU.S. 463\n, 55 S.Ct. 789; Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, \n297 \nU.S. 288, 324\n, 56 S.Ct. 466, 472; Anniston Manufacturing Co. v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 337, 355\n, 57 S.Ct. 816, 824. By the cross-bill, defendants seek a judgment that each and every provision of the act is unconstitutional. It presents a variety of hypothetical controversies which may never become real. We are invited to enter into a speculative inquiry for the purpose of condemning statutory provisions the effect of which in concrete situations, not yet developed, cannot now be definitely perceived. We must decline that invitation. Anniston Manufacturing Co. v.

Danzig, of Jamaica, L.I., on the brief) for respondent.\n\n\n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 69]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether the oft-challenged doctrine of Swift v. Tyson1 shall now be disapproved.\n Tompkins, a citizen of Pennsylvania, was injured on a dark night by a passing freight train of the Erie Railroad Company while walking along its right of way at Hughestown in that state. He claimed that the accident occurred through negligence in the operation, or maintenance, of the train; that he was rightfully on the premises as licensee because on a commonly used beaten footpath which ran for a short distance alongside the tracks; and that he was struck by something which looked like a door projecting from one of the moving cars. To enforce that claim he brought an action in the federal court for Southern New York, which had jurisdiction because the company is a corporation of that state. It denied liability; and the case was tried by a jury. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 70]\n\u00a0\n The Erie insisted that its duty to Tompkins was no greater than that owed to a trespasser. It contended, among other things, that its duty to Tompkins, and hence its liability, should be determined in accordance with the Pennsylvania law; that under the law of Pennsylvania, as declared by its highest court, persons who use pathways along the railroad right of way-that is, a longitudinal pathway as distinguished from a crossing-are to be deemed trespassers; and that the railroad is not liable for injuries to undiscovered trespassers resulting from its negligence, unless it be wanton or willful. Tompkins denied that any such rule had been established by the decisions of the Pennsylvania courts; and contended that, since there was no statute of the state on the subject, the railroad's duty and liability is to be determined in federal courts as a matter of general law.\n The trial judge refused to rule that the applicable law precluded recovery. The jury brought in a verdict of $30,000; and the judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, which held ( 2 Cir., 90 F.2d 603, 604), that it was unnecessary to consider whether the law of Pennsylvania was as contended, because the question was one not of local, but of general, law, and that 'upon questions of general law the federal courts are free, in absence of a local statute, to exercise their independent judgment as to what the law is; and it is well settled that the question of the responsibility of a railroad for injuries caused by its servants is one of general law. ... Where the public has made open and notorious use of a railroad right of way for a long period of time and without objection, the company owes to persons on such permissive pathway a duty of care in the operation of its trains. ... It is likewise generally recognized law that a jury may find that negligence exists toward a pedestrian using a permissive path on the railroad right of way if he is hit by some object projecting from the side of the train.' \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 71]\n\u00a0\n The Erie had contended that application of the Pennsylvania rule was required, among other things, by section 34 of the Federal Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, 28 U.S.C.  725, 28 U.S.C.A. s 725, which provides: 'The laws of the several States, except where the Constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law, in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply.'\n Because of the importance of the question whether the federal court was free to disregard the alleged rule of the Pennsylvania common law, we granted certiorari. \n302 \nU.S. 671\n, 58 S.Ct. 50, 82 L.Ed. --.\n First. Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, 18, held that federal courts exercising jurisdiction on the ground of diversity of citizenship need not, in matters of general jurisprudence, apply the unwritten law of the state as declared by its highest court; that they are free to exercise an independent judgment as to what the common law of the state is-or should be; and that, as there stated by Mr. Justice Story, 'the true interpretation of the 34th section limited its application to state laws, strictly local, that is to say, to the positive statutes of the state, and the construction thereof adopted by the local tribunals, and to rights and titles to things having a permanent locality, such as the rights and titles to real estate, and other matters immovable and intra-territorial in their nature and character. It never has been supposed by us, that the section did apply, or was designed to apply, to questions of a more general nature, not at all dependent upon local statutes or local usages of a fixed and permanent operation, as, for example, to the construction of ordinary contracts or other written instruments, and especially to questions of general commercial law, where the state tribunals are called upon to perform the like functions as ourselves, that is, to ascertain, upon general reasoning and legal analogies, what is the true exposition of the contract or \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 72]\n\u00a0\n instrument, or what is the just rule furnished by the principles of commercial law to govern the case.'\n The Court in applying the rule of section 34 to equity cases, in Mason v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 545, 559\n, 43 S.Ct. 200, 204, said: 'The statute, however, is merely declarative of the rule which would exist in the absence of the statute.' \n2\n The federal courts assumed, in the broad field of 'general law,' the power to declare rules of decision which Congress was confessedly without power to enact as statutes. Doubt was repeatedly expressed as to the correctness of the construction given section 34,3 and as to the soundness of the rule which it introduced. \n4\n But it was the more recent research of a competent scholar, who examined the original document, which established that the construction given to it by the Court was erroneous; and that the purpose of the section was merely to make certain that, in all matters except those in which some federal law is controlling, \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 73]\n\u00a0\n the federal courts exercising jurisdiction in diversity of citizenship cases would apply as their rules of decision the law of the state, unwritten as well as written. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Criticism of the doctrine became widespread after the decision of Black & White Taxicab & Transfer Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab & Transfer Co., \n276 \nU.S. 518\n, 48 S.Ct. 404, 57 A.L.R. 426.6 There, Brown &Yellow, a Kentucky corporation owned by Kentuckians, and the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, also a Kentucky corporation, wished that the former should have the exclusive privilege of soliciting passenger and baggage transportation at the Bowling Green, Ky., Railroad station; and that the Black & White, a competing Kentucky corporation, should be prevented from interfering with that privilege. Knowing that such a contract would be void under the common law of Kentucky, it was arranged that the Brown & Yellow reincorporate under the law of Tennessee, and that the contract with the railroad should be executed there. The suit was then brought by the Tennessee corporation in the federal court for Western Kentucky to enjoin competition by the Black & White; an injunction issued by the District Court \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 74]\n\u00a0\n was sustained by the Court of Appeals; and this Court, citing many decisions in which the doctrine of Swift & Tyson had been applied, affirmed the decree.\n Second. Experience in applying the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson, had revealed its defects, political and social; and the benefits expected to flow from the rule did not accrue. Persistence of state courts in their own opinions on questions of common law prevented uniformity;7 and the impossibility of discovering a satisfactory line of demarcation between the province of general law and that of local law developed a new well of uncertainties. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n On the other hand, the mischievous results of the doctrine had become apparent. Diversity of citizenship jurisdiction was conferred in order to prevent apprehended discrimination in state courts against those not citizens of the state. Swift v. Tyson introduced grave discrimination by noncitizens against citizens. It made rights enjoyed under the unwritten 'general law' vary according to whether enforcement was sought in the state \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 75]\n\u00a0\n or in the federal court; and the privilege of selecting the court in which the right should be determined was conferred upon the noncitizen. \n9\n Thus, the doctrine rendered impossible equal protection of the law. In attempting to promote uniformity of law throughout the United States, the doctrine had prevented uniformity in the administration of the law of the state.\n The discrimination resulting became in practice far-reaching. This resulted in part from the broad province accorded to the so-called 'general law' as to which federal courts exercised an independent judgment. 10 In addition to questions of purely commercial law, 'general law' was held to include the obligations under contracts entered into and to be performed within the state, 11 the extent to which a carrier operating within a state may stipulate for exemption from liability for his own negligence or that of his employee;12 the liability for torts committed within the state upon persons resident or property located there, even where the question of lia- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 76]\n\u00a0\n bility depended upon the scope of a property right conferred by the state; 13 and the right to exemplary or punitive damages. \n14\n Furthermore, state decisions construing local deeds,15 mineral conveyances,16 and even devises of real estate, 17 were disregarded. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n In part the discrimination resulted from the wide range of persons held entitled to avail themselves of the federal rule by resort to the diversity of citizenship jurisdiction. Through this jurisdiction individual citizens willing to remove from their own state and become citizens of another might avail themselves of the federal rule. \n19\n And, without even change of residence, a corporate citizen of \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 77]\n\u00a0\n the state could avail itself of the federal rule by reincorporating under the laws of another state, as was done in the Taxicab Case.\n The injustice and confusion incident to the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson have been repeatedly urged as reasons for abolishing or limiting diversity of citizenship jurisdiction. \n20\n Other legislative relief has been proposed. 21 If only a question of statutory construction were involved, we should not be prepared to abandon a doctrine so widely applied throughout nearly a century. \n22\n But the uncon- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 78]\n\u00a0\n stitutionality of the course pursued has now been made clear, and compels us to do so.\n Third. Except in matters governed by the Federal Constitution or by acts of Congress, the law to be applied in any case is the law of the state. And whether the law of the state shall be declared by its Legislature in a statute or by its highest court in a decision is not a matter of federal concern. There is no federal general common law. Congress has no power to declare substantive rules of common law applicable in a state whether they be local in their nature or 'general,' be they commercial law or a part of the law of torts. And no clause in the Constitution purports to confer such a power upon the federal courts. As stated by Mr. Justice Field when protesting in Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co. v. Baugh, \n149 \nU.S. 368, 401\n, 13 S.Ct. 914, 927, against ignoring the Ohio common law of fellow-servant liability: I am aware that what has been termed the general law of the country-which is often little less than what the judge advancing the doctrine thinks at the time should be the general law on a particular subject-has been often advanced in judicial opinions of this court to control a conflicting law of a state. I admit that learned judges have fallen into the habit of repeating this doctrine as a convenient mode of brushing aside the law of a state in conflict with their views. And I confess that, moved and governed by the authority of the great names of those judges, I have, myself, in many instances, unhesitatingly and confidently, but I think now erroneously, repeated the same doctrine. But, notwithstanding the great names which may be cited in favor of the doctrine, and notwithstanding the frequency with which the doctrine has been reiterated, there stands, as a perpetual protest against its repetition, the constitution of the United States, which recognizes and preserves the autonomy and independence of the states,- independence in their legislative and inde- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 79]\n\u00a0\n pendence in their judicial departments. Supervision over either the legislative or the judicial action of the states is in no case permissible except as to matters by the constitution specifically authorized or delegated to the United States. Any interference with either, except as thus permitted, is an invasion of the authority of the state, and, to that extent, a denial of its independence.'\n The fallacy underlying the rule declared in Swift v. Tyson is made clear by Mr. Justice Holmes. \n23\n The doctrine rests upon the assumption that there is 'a transcendental body of law outside of any particular State but obligatory within it unless and until changed by statute,' that federal courts have the power to use their judgment as to what the rules of common law are; and that in the federal courts 'the parties are entitled to an independent judgment on matters of general law':\n'But law in the sense in which courts speak of it today does not exist without some definite authority behind it. The common law so far as it is enforced in a State, whether called common law or not, is not the common law generally but the law of that State existing by the authority of that State without regard to what it may have been in England or anywhere else. ...\n\n'The authority and only authority is the State, and if that be so, the voice adopted by the State as its own (whether it be of its Legislature or of its Supreme Court) should utter the last word.'\n\n Thus the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson is, as Mr. Justice Holmes said, 'an unconstitutional assumption of powers by the Courts of the United States which no lapse of time or respectable array of opinion should make us hesitate to correct.' In disapproving that doctrine we do not hold \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 80]\n\u00a0\n unconstitutional section 34 of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789 or any other act of Congress. We merely declare that in applying the doctrine this Court and the lower courts have invaded rights which in our opinion are reserved by the Constitution to the several states.\n Fourth. The defendant contended that by the common law of Pennsylvania as declared by its highest court in Falchetti v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 307 Pa. 203, 160 A. 859, the only duty owed to the plaintiff was to refrain from willful or wanton injury. The plaintiff denied that such is the Pennsylvania law. \n24\n In support of their respective contentions the parties discussed and cited many decisions of the Supreme Court of the state. The Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the question of liability is one of general law; and on that ground declined to decide the issue of state law. As we hold this was error, the judgment is reversed and the case remanded to it for further proceedings in conformity with our opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER (dissenting).\n The case presented by the evidence is a simple one. Plaintiff was severely injured in Pennsylvania. While walking on defendant's right of way along a much-used path at the end of the cross-ties of its main track, he came into collision with an open door swinging from the side of a car in a train going in the opposite direction. Having been warned by whistle and headlight, he saw the locomo- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 81]\n\u00a0\n tive approaching and had time and space enough to step aside and so avoid danger. To justify his failure to get out of the way, he says that upon many other occasions he had safely walked there while trains passed.\n Invoking jurisdiction on the ground of diversity of citizenship, plaintiff, a citizen and resident of Pennsylvania, brought this suit to recover damages against defendant, a New York corporation, in the federal court for the Southern District of that state. The issues were whether negligence of defendant was a proximate cause of his injuries, and whether negligence of plaintiff contributed. He claimed that, by hauling the car with the open door, defendant violated a duty to him. The defendant insisted that it violated no duty, and that plaintiff's injuries were caused by his own negligence. The jury gave him a verdict on which the trial court entered judgment; the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 2 Cir ., 90 F.2d 603.\n Defendant maintained, citing Falchetti v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 307 Pa. 203, 160 A. 859, and Koontz v. Baltimore & O.R. Co., 309 Pa. 122, 163 A. 212, that the only duty owed plaintiff was to refrain from willfully or wantonly injuring him; it argued that the courts of Pennsylvania had so ruled with respect to persons using a customary longitudinal path, as distinguished from one crossing the track. The plaintiff insisted that the Pennsylvania decisions did not establish the rule for which the defendant contended. Upon that issue the Circuit Court of Appeals said (90 F.2d 603, et page 604): 'We need not go into this matter since the defendant concedes that the great weight of authority in other states is to the contrary. This concession is fatal to its contention, for upon questions of general law the federal courts are free, in absence of a local statute, to exercise their independent judgment as to what the law is; and it is well settled that the question of the responsibility of a railroad for injuries caused by its servants is one of general law.' \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 82]\n\u00a0\n Upon that basis the court held the evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that plaintiff's injuries were caused by the negligence of defendant. It also held the question of contributory negligence one for the jury.\n Defendant's petition for writ of certiorari presented two questions: Whether its duty toward plaintiff should have been determined in accordance with the law as found by the highest court of Pennsylvania, and whether the evidence conclusively showed plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence. Plaintiff contends that, as always heretofore held by this Court, the issues of negligence and contributory negligence are to be determined by general law against which local decisions may not be held conclusive; that defendant relies on a solitary Pennsylvania case of doubtful applicability, and that, even if the decisions of the courts of that state were deemed controlling, the same result would have to be reached.\n No constitutional question was suggested or argued below or here. And as a general rule, this Court will not consider any question not raised below and presented by the petition. Olson v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 246, 262\n, 54 S.Ct. 704, 711; Johnson v. Manhattan Ry. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 479, 494\n, 53 S.Ct. 721, 726; Gunning v. Cooley, \n281 \nU.S. 90, 98\n, 50 S.Ct. 231, 234. Here it does not decide either of the questions presented, but, changing the rule of decision in force since the foundation of the government, remands the case to be adjudged according to a standard never before deemed permissible.\n The opinion just announced states that: 'The question for decision is whether the oft-challenged doctrine of Swift v. Tyson (1842, 16 Pet. 1) shall now be disapproved.'\n That case involved the construction of the Judiciary Act of 1789,  34, 28 U.S.C.A.  725: 'The laws of the several States, except where the Constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law, in the courts of \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 83]\n\u00a0\n the United States, in cases where they apply.' Expressing the view of all the members of the Court, Mr. Justice Story said (16 Pet. 1, at page 18): 'In the ordinary use of language, it will hardly be contended, that the decisions of courts constitute laws. They are, at most, only evidence of what the laws are, and are not, of themselves, laws. They are often reexamined, reversed, and qualified by courts themselves, whenever they are found to be either defective, or illfounded, or otherwise incorrect. The laws of a state are more usually understood to mean the rules and enactments promulgated by the legislative authority thereof, or long-established local customs having the force of laws. In all the various cases, which have hitherto come before us for decision, this court have uniformly supposed, that the true interpretation of the 34th section limited its application to state laws strictly local, that is to say, to the positive statutes of the state, and the construction thereof adopted by the local tribunals, and to rights and titles to things having a permanent locality, such as the rights and titles to real estate, and other matters immovable and intraterritorial in their nature and character. It never has been supposed by us, that the section did apply, or was designed to apply, to questions of a more general nature, not at all dependent upon local statutes or local usages of a fixed and permanent operation, as, for example, to the construction of ordinary contracts or other written instruments, and especially to questions of general commercial law, where the state tribunals are called upon to perform the like functions as ourselves, that is, to ascertain, upon general reasoning and legal analogies, what is the true exposition of the contract or instrument, or what is the just rule furnished by the principles of commercial law to govern the case. And we have not now the slightest difficulty in holding, that this section, upon its true intendment and construction, is strictly limited to local statutes and local usages of the character \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 84]\n\u00a0\n before stated, and does not extend to contracts and other instruments of a commercial nature, the true interpretation and effect whereof are to be sought, not in the decisions of the local tribunals, but in the general principles and doctrines of commercial jurisprudence. Undoubtedly, the decisions of the local tribunals upon such subjects are entitled to, and will receive, the most deliberate attention and respect of this court; but they cannot furnish positive rules or conclusive authority, by which our own judgments are to be bound up and governed.' (Italics added.)\n The doctrine of that case has been followed by this Court in an unbroken line of decisions. So far as appears, it was not questioned until more than 50 years later, and then by a single judge. \n1\n Baltimore & O. Railroad Co. v. Baugh, \n149 \nU.S. 368, 390\n, 13 S.Ct. 914. In that case, Mr. Justice Brewer, speaking for the Court, truly said (\n149 \nU.S. 368\n, at page 373, 13 S.Ct. 914, 916): 'Whatever differences of opinion may have been expressed have not been on the question whether a matter of general law should be settled by the independent judgment of this court, rather than through an adherence to the decisions of the state courts, but upon the other question, whether a given matter is one of local or of general law.'\n And since that decision, the division of opinion in this Court has been of the same character as it was before. In 1910, Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for himself and two other Justices, dissented from the holding that a \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 85]\n\u00a0\n court of the United States was bound to exercise its own independent judgment in the construction of a conveyance made before the state courts had rendered an authoritative decision as to its meaning and effect. Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., \n215 \nU.S. 349\n, 30 S.Ct. 140. But that dissent accepted (\n215 \nU.S. 349\n, at page 371, 30 S.Ct. 140) as 'settled' the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson, and insisted (\n215 \nU.S. 349\n, at page 372, 30 S.Ct. 140) merely that the case under consideration was by nature and necessity peculiarly local.\n Thereafter, as before, the doctrine was constantly applied. \n2\n In Black & White Taxicab Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab Co., \n276 \nU.S. 518\n, 48 S.Ct. 404, 57 A.L.R. 426, three judges dissented. The writer of the dissent, Mr. Justice Holmes said, however (\n276 \nU.S. 518\n, at page 535, 48 S.Ct. 404, 409, 57 A.L.R. 426): 'I should leave Swift v. Tyson undisturbed, as I indicated in Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., but I would not allow it to spread the assumed dominion into new fields.'\n No more unqualified application of the doctrine can be found than in decisions of this Court speaking through Mr. Justice Holmes. United Zinc Co. v. Britt, \n258 \nU.S. 268\n, 42 S.Ct. 299, 36 A.L.R. 28; Baltimore & O.R.R. Co. v. Goodman, \n275 \nU.S. 66, 70\n, 48 S.Ct. 24, 25, 56 A.L.R. 645. Without in the slightest departing from that doctrine, but implicitly applying it, the strictness of the rule laid down in the Goodman Case was somewhat ameliorated by Pokora v. Wabash Ry. Co., \n292 \nU.S. 98\n, 54 S.Ct. 580, 91 A.L.R. 1049\n\n\n Whenever possible, consistently with standards sustained by reason and authority constituting the general law, this Court has followed applicable decisions of state courts. Mutual Life Co. v. Johnson, \n293 \nU.S. 335, 339\n, 55 S.Ct. 154, 156. See Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 \nU.S. 20\n, 34 2 S.Ct. 10; Black & White Taxicab Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab Co., supra, \n276 \nU.S. 518\n, at page 530, 48 S.Ct. 404, 407, 57 A.L.R. 426. Unquestionably, the determination of the issues of negligence and contributory negligence upon which decision of this case \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 86]\n\u00a0\n depends are questions of general law. Hough v. Texas Railway Co., \n100 \nU.S. 213\n, 226; Lake Shore Railway Co. v. Prentice, \n147 \nU.S. 101\n, 13 S.Ct. 261; Baltimore & O. Railroad Co. v. Baugh, supra; Gardner v. Michigan Central Railroad Co., \n150 \nU.S. 349, 358\n, 14 S.Ct. 140; Central Vermont Ry. Co. v. White, \n238 \nU.S. 507, 512\n, 35 S. Ct. 865, Ann.Cas.1916B, 252; Baltimore & O.R.R. Co. v. Goodman, supra; Pokora v. Wabash Ry. Co., supra.\n While amendments to section 34 have from time to time been suggested, the section stands as originally enacted. Evidently Congress has intended throughout the years that the rule of decision as construed should continue to govern federal courts in trials at common law. The opinion just announced suggests that Mr. Warren's research has established that from the beginning this Court has erroneously construed section 34. But that author's 'New Light on the History of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789' does not purport to be authoritative, and was intended to be no more than suggestive. The weight to be given to his discovery has never been discussed at this bar. Nor does the opinion indicate the ground disclosed by the research. In his dissenting opinion in the Taxicab Case, Mr. Justice Holmes referred to Mr. Warren's work, but failed to persuade the Court that 'laws' as used in section 34 included varying and possibly ill- considered rulings by the courts of a state on questions of common law. See, e.g., Swift v. Tyson, supra, 16 Pet. 1, 16, 17. It well may be that, if the Court should now call for argument of counsel on the basis of Mr. Warren's research, it would adhere to the construction it has always put upon section 34. Indeed, the opinion in this case so indicates. For it declares: 'If only a question of statutory construction were involved, we should not be prepared to abandon a doctrine so widely applied throughout nearly a century. But the unconstitutionality of the course pursued has now been made clear and compels us to do so.' This means that, so far as concerns the rule of decision now condemned, the Judiciary Act of 1789, passed to establish judicial \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 87]\n\u00a0\n courts to exert the judicial power of the United States, and especially section 34 of that act as construed, is unconstitutional; that federal courts are now bound to follow decisions of the courts of the state in which the controversies arise; and that Congress is powerless otherwise to ordain. It is hard to foresee the consequences of the radical change so made. Our opinion in the Taxicab Case cites numerous decisions of this Court which serve in part to indicate the field from which it is now intended forever to bar the federal courts. It extends to all matters of contracts and torts not positively governed by state enactments. Counsel searching for precedent and reasoning to disclose common-law principles on which to guide clients and conduct litigation are by this decision told that as to all of these questions the decisions of this Court and other federal courts are no longer anywhere authoritative.\n This Court has often emphasized its reluctance to consider constitutional questions and that legislation will not be held invalid as repugnant to the fundamental law if the case may be decided upon any other ground. In view of grave consequences liable to result from erroneous exertion of its power to set aside legislation, the Court should move cautiously, seek assistance of counsel, act only after ample deliberation, show that the question is before the Court, that its decision cannot be avoided by construction of the statute assailed or otherwise, indicate precisely the principle or provision of the Constitutional held to have been transgressed, and fully disclose the reasons and authorities found to warrant the conclusion of invalidity. These safeguards against the improvident use of the great power to invalidate legislation are so well- grounded and familiar that statement of reasons or citation of authority to support them is no longer necessary. But see, e.g., Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 553; Township of Pine Grove v. Talcott, 19 Wall. 666, 673; Chicago, etc., Railway Co. v. Wellman, \n143 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 12 S.Ct. 400; \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 88]\n\u00a0\n Baker v. Grice, \n169 \nU.S. 284, 292\n, 18 S.Ct. 323; Martin v. District of Columbia, \n205 \nU.S. 135, 140\n, 27 S.Ct. 440.\n So far as appears, no litigant has ever challenged the power of Congress to establish the rule as construed. It has so long endured that its destruction now without appropriate deliberation cannot be justified. There is nothing in the opinion to suggest that consideration of any constitutional question is necessary to a decision of the case. By way of reasoning, it contains nothing that requires the conclusion reached. Admittedly, there is no authority to support that conclusion. Against the protest of those joining in this opinion, the Court declines to assign the case for reargument. It may not justly be assumed that the labor and argument of counsel for the parties would not disclose the right conclusion and aid the Court in the statement of reasons to support it. Indeed, it would have been appropriate to give Congress opportunity to be heard before devesting it of power to prescribe rules of decision to be followed in the courts of the United States. See Myers v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 52, 176\n, 47 S.Ct. 21, 45.\n The course pursued by the Court in this case is repugnant to the Act of Congress of August 24, 1937, 50 Stat. 751, 28 U.S.C.A.  17 and note, 349a, 380a and note, 401. It declares that: 'Whenever the constitutionality of any Act of Congress affecting the public interest is drawn in question in any court of the United States in any suit or proceeding to which the United States, or any agency thereof, or any officer or employee thereof, as such officer or employee, is not a party, the court having jurisdiction of the suit or proceeding shall certify such fact to the Attorney General. In any such case the court shall permit the United States to intervene and become a party for presentation of evidence ( if evidence is otherwise receivable in such suit or proceeding) and argument upon the question of the constitutionality of such Act. In any such suit or proceeding the United States shall, subject to the applicable provisions of law, have all the rights of a \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 89]\n\u00a0\n party and the liabilities of a party as to court costs to the extent necessary for a proper presentation of the facts and law relating to the constitutionality of such Act.' Section 1, 28 U.S.C.A.  401. That provision extends to this Court. Section 5, 28 U.S.C.A.  380a note. If defendant had applied for and obtained the writ of certiorari upon the claim that, as now held, Congress has no power to prescribe the rule of decision, section 34 as construed, it would have been the duty of this Court to issue the prescribed certificate to the Attorney General in order that the United States might intervene and be heard on the constitutional question. Within the purpose of the statute and its true intent and meaning, the constitutionality of that measure has been 'drawn in question.' Congress intended to give the United States the right to be heard in every case involving constitutionality of an act affecting the public interest. In view of the rule that, in the absence of challenge of constitutionality, statutes will not here be invalidated on that ground, the Act of August 24, 1937 extends to cases where constitutionality is first 'drawn in question' by the Court. No extraordinary or unusual action by the Court after submission of the cause should be permitted to frustrate the wholesome purpose of that act. The duty it imposes ought here to be willingly assumed. If it were doubtful whether this case is within the scope of the act, the Court should give the United States opportunity to intervene and, if so advised, to present argument on the constitutional question, for undoubtedly it is one of great public importance. That would be to construe the act according to its meaning.\n The Court's opinion in its first sentence defines the question to be whether the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson shall now be disapproved; it recites (third page, 58 S.Ct. 819) that Congress is without power to prescribe rules of decision that have been followed by federal courts as a result of the construction of section 34 in Swift v. Tyson and since; after discussion, it declares (seventh page, 58 S.Ct. 822) that 'the unconstitutionality of the course pursued (meaning the rule of decision \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 90]\n\u00a0\n resulting from that construction) ... compels' abandonment of the doctrine so long applied; and then near the end of the last page, 58 S.Ct. 823, the Court states that it does not hold section 34 unconstitutional, but merely that, in applying the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson construing it, this Court and the lower courts have invaded rights which are reserved by the Constitution to the several states. But, plainly through the form of words employed, the substance of the decision appears; it strikes down as unconstitutional section 34 as construed by our decisions; it divests the Congress of power to prescribe rules to be followed by federal courts when deciding questions of general law. In that broad field it compels this and the lower federal courts to follow decisions of the courts of a particular state.\n I am of opinion that the constitutional validity of the rule need not be considered, because under the law, as found by the courts of Pennsylvania and generally throughout the country, it is plain that the evidence required a finding that plaintiff was guilty of negligence that contributed to cause his injuries, and that the judgment below should be reversed upon that ground.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, concurs in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice REED (concurring in part).\n I concur in the conclusion reached in this case, in the disapproval of the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson, and in the reasoning of the majority opinion, except in so far as it relies upon the unconstitutionality of the 'course pursued' by the federal courts.\n The 'doctrine of Swift v. Tyson,' as I understand it, is that the words 'the laws,' as used in section 34, line 1, of the Federal Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, 28 U.S.C.A.  725, do not included in their meaning 'the decisions of the local tribunals.' Mr. Justice Story, in deciding that point, said, 16 Pet. 1, 19: \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 91]\n\u00a0\n 'Undoubtedly, the decisions of the local tribunals upon such subjects are entitled to, and will receive, the most deliberate attention and respect of this court; but they cannot furnish positive rules, or conclusive authority, by which our own judgments are to be bound up and governed.'\n To decide the case now before us and to 'disapprove' the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson requires only that we say that the words 'the laws' include in their meaning the decisions of the local tribunals. As the majority opinion shows, by its reference to Mr. Warren's researches and the first quotation from Mr. Justice Holmes, that this Court is now of the view that 'laws' includes 'decisions,' it is unnecessary to go further and declare that the 'course pursued' was 'unconstitutional,' instead of merely erroneous.\n The 'unconstitutional' course referred to in the majority opinion is apparently the ruling in Swift v. Tyson that the supposed omission of Congress to legislate as to the effect of decisions leaves federal courts free to interpret general law for themselves. I am not at all sure whether, in the absence of federal statutory direction, federal courts would be compelled to follow state decisions. There was sufficient doubt about the matter in 1789 to induce the first Congress to legislate. No former opinions of this Court have passed upon it. Mr. Justice Holmes evidently saw nothing 'unconstitutional' which required the overruling of Swift v. Tyson, for he said in the very opinion quoted by the majority, 'I should leave Swift v. Tyson undisturbed, as I indicated in Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., but I would not allow it to spread the assumed dominion into new fields.' Black & White Taxicab Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab Co., \n276 \nU.S. 518, 535\n, 48 S.Ct. 404, 409, 57 A.L.R. 426. If the opinion commits this Court to the position that the Congress is without power to declare what rules of substantive law shall govern the federal courts, \n\n[304 \nU.S. 64, 92]\n\u00a0\n that conclusion also seems questionable. The line between procedural and substantive law is hazy, but no one doubts federal power over procedure. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1. The Judiciary Article, 3, and the 'necessary and proper' clause of article 1,  8, may fully authorize legislation, such as this section of the Judiciary Act.\n In this Court, stare decisis, in statutory construction, is a useful rule, not an inexorable command. Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., \n285 \nU.S. 393\n, dissent, page 406, note 1, 52 S.Ct. 443, 446. Compare Read v. Bishop of Lincoln, (1892) A.C. 644, 655; London Street Tramways v. London County Council, (1898) A.C. 375, 379. It seems preferable to overturn an established construction of an act of Congress, rather than, in the circumstances of this case, to interpret the Constitution. Cf. United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366\n, 29 S.Ct. 527.\n There is no occasion to discuss further the range or soundness of these few phrases of the opinion. It is sufficient now to call attention to them and express my own non-acquiescence. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Mandate conformed to 98 F.2d 49. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 1842, 16 Pet. 1.

Co., D.C., 43 F.2d 953, 956, 957, 71 A.L.R. 1096, decisions of this Court on common-law questions are less likely than formerly to promote uniformity. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] Compare 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History, Rev. Ed. 1935, 89: 'Probably no decision of the Court has ever given rise to more uncertainty as to legal rights; and though doubtless intended to promote uniformity in the operation of business transactions, its chief effect has been to render it difficult for business men to know in advance to what particular topic the Court would apply the doctrine. ...' The Federal Digest through the 1937 volume, lists nearly 1,000 decisions involving the distinction between questions of general and of local law. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] It was even possible for a nonresident plaintiff defeated on a point of law in the highest court of a State nevertheless to win out by taking a nonsuit and renewing the controversy in the federal court.

UNITED STATES(1938)\nNo. 415\nArgued: Decided: February 28, 1938\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Michigan. at \n\n[303 \nU.S. 315, 316]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John S. Burchmore, of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n Mr. J. Stanley Payne, of Washington, D.C., for appellees The United States and Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. C. R. Sutherland, of Chicago, Ill., for appellees Henry A. Scandrett et al., trustees of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific R. Co.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from the judgment of a specially constituted District Court1 dismissing the appellant's bill which prayed relief against an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission approving and authorizing a proposed pooling agreement between two other railroads. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 315, 317]\n\u00a0\n The single question presented is whether the appellant is a 'carrier involved' within the meaning of section 5(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The appellant, hereinafter sometimes called 'Escanaba,' is a Michigan corporation operating a railroad which does business in intrastate and interstate commerce. Its line extends from Escanaba, Mich., a port on Lake Michigan, northwesterly some 63 miles to Channing, which is on the northern border of the Menominee ore district. This district was reached in 1900, and still is served, by the lines of the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad Company (herein denominated 'Northwestern'), extending from the mines in a general southwesterly direction to the Northwestern's ore docks at Escanaba. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company ( herein called 'Milwaukee') had in and prior to 1900 a line reaching the Menominee district, but the ore shipped over this line went south to a connection with the Soo Line and thence eastward to a destination other than Escanaba. Milwaukee and Escanaba entered into an agreement in 1900 whereby the former was to have trackage rights for its trains of iron ore from Channing to Escanaba, where the Milwaukee constructed its own ore docks for the lading of ore into lake steamers, and trackage rights for the return of its empty cars from Escanaba to Channing. On the footing of this contract Escanaba made a large investment in roadway suitable for the accommodation of Milwaukee's trains.\n The details of the agreement are unimportant. It will suffice to say that Milwaukee had no right to carry passengers or freight, including ore, to intermediate points on the line of Escanaba; had no schedules for its ore \n\n[303 \nU.S. 315, 318]\n\u00a0\n trains; operated them by its own personnel and power, subject, however, to the control of the line by Escanaba's dispatchers and signal men. Milwaukee was to pay for the privilege a certain wheelage charge which, in no event, was to be less than $27,000 a year whether the total wheelage amounted to that sum or not; and was to pay certain other amounts towards the maintenance of Escanaba's line. A renewal of this agreement is now in force and will so remain until January 1, 1951\n\n\n Milwaukee's docks at Escanaba have fallen into disrepair. To avoid the large expenditure required to restore them, and to retain a share of the ore transportation, Milwaukee negotiated a pooling agreement with Northwestern under the terms of which ore consigned over either line from the mines to Escanaba will be routed over Northwestern's line and use Northwestern's docks at Escanaba and the ore business of both lines will be pooled on an agreed basis. Inasmuch as certain freight other than iron ore has been interchanged by Milwaukee with Escanaba at Channing and by Northwestern with Escanaba at Escanaba, and, as it is believed the ore pooling arrangement and discontinuance of Milwaukee's ore haulage over Escanaba's tracks may cause Escanaba to abandon the western end of its line, thus preventing the interchange of Milwaukee and Escanaba at Channing, it is further agreed that Milwaukee and Northwestern shall pool the receipts from interchange traffic exchanged by either of them with Escanaba, to recompense Milwaukee for possible loss of business resulting from the ore traffic pool. The two railroads, parties to the pooling agreement, submitted it to the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval. 4 That body held that the proposed discontinuance of operation by Milwaukee over Escanaba's line under the trackage agreement \n\n[303 \nU.S. 315, 319]\n\u00a0\n amounted to an abandonment as defined by section 1(18) of the Interstate Commerce Act5 and, without the Commission's approval of the abandonment, the pooling agreement could not become effective. The Commission, therefore, refused to pass upon it. Thereupon the parties resubmitted the pooling agreement together with a conditional application by Milwaukee for abandonment of its ore haulage over Escanaba. Escanaba intervened in the proceeding, and resisted the issue of an order of approval. A hearing was had at which not only Escanaba but many shippers and communities on its line presented evidence. The Commission made the findings required by sections 1(18) and 5(1) of the act, particularly that the proposed pooling arrangement and abandonment of the line by Milwaukee would promote the public interest and convenience and issued orders authorizing the proposed arrangement. Escanaba has abandoned the contention made in the District Court, and there overruled, that the Commission's findings are not supported by any evidence, and here attacks only the alleged error of law of the Commission and the court below in holding that it is not a 'party involved' in the pooling agreement within the meaning of section 5(1), whose assent is necessary to the approval of the Commission.\n Section 5(1) of the original Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  5( 1) note, in sweeping terms forbade all pooling of freights of different and competing railroads and all agreements for division of aggregate or net proceeds of their earnings or any portion thereof. The Transportation Act 1920,  407, 49 U.S.C.A.  5(1), qualified this prohibition by excepting such arrangements as should have the specific approval of the Commission, and that approval was thus conditioned:\n'That whenever the commission is of opinion, after hearing upon application of any carrier or carriers engaged in the transportation of passengers or property sub- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 315, 320]\n\u00a0\n ject to this Act (chapter), or upon its own initiative, that the division of their traffic or earnings, to the extent indicated by the commission, will be in the interest of better service to the public, or economy in operation, and will not unduly restrain competition, the commission shall have authority by order to approved and authorize, if assented to by all the carriers involved, such division of traffic or earnings, under such rules and regulations, and for such consideration as between such carriers and upon such terms and conditions, as shall be found by the commission to be just and reasonable in the premises.' (Italics supplied.)\n\n The controversy revolves around the meaning of the phrase 'if assented to by all the carriers involved.' Escanaba insists that it is a carrier involved in the proposed agreement, and its assent is necessary to an affirmative order of the Commission. The appellees deny that it is such and the Commission and the District Court have held with them. We are of opinion that the decree of the District Court was right and must be affirmed.\n First. The amendment of section 5(1) of the original statute by the Transportation Act 1920 was one of the alterations made in the act as a result of experience gained from unified operation of the railroads under federal control. The strict sanctions of the original act, intended to preserve competition between carriers, were, in a number of instances, relaxed. Mergers and consolidations were authorized, pooling arrangements were to be permitted, extensions and abandonments were made lawful, and divisions of joint through rates might be adjusted, all for the sake of economy and efficiency and the prevention of destructive competitive practices, and all subject to the supervision and control of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and its finding that the action proposed or ordered would be in the public interest. These amendments are to be given liberal construction in aid of the purposes Congress had in mind. Under the new provi- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 315, 321]\n\u00a0\n sions, Milwaukee and Northwestern might have merged or consolidated if the Commission found such a procedure would be in the public interest. Similar considerations would justify their proposed pooling of freight transportation. Shippers over Escanaba's lines, communities served by it, and, indeed, shippers in communities on distant lines and persons having no other interest than that of the general public welfare, were entitled to be heard before the Commission and to present whatever proofs might tend to show that the proposed agreement would or would not be for the public welfare. They, however, are not 'carriers involved,' mentioned in section 5(1). Escanaba had the undoubted right accorded it to appear and to be heard on the question of the public interest and welfare, and indeed so had every carrier having connections with Milwaukee and Northwestern. The question involved in the appellant's contention is whether it or any other carrier, not actually a party to the pooling agreement, is a 'carrier involved' within the meaning of the act, so that it may frustrate the agreement by withholding its assent.\n Second. Escanaba is not a carrier of the ore which is hauled between Channing and Escanaba under the trackage agreement. It receives no part of the freight paid, it issues no bills of lading, it maintains no tariffs covering that transportation. It neither holds itself out to serve in that respect nor renders any service to shippers of ore; and, as respects the proposed pooling of freights on Milwaukee's traffic, exchanged with it at Channing, and Northwestern's traffic, exchanged with it at Escanaba, is not a carrier involved in the service rendered up to the exchange points, which is to be pooled. But it is said that the word 'involved' connotes something more than a party to an agreement; that it embraces any railroad affected by the arrangement. And, it is urged, Escanaba will be seriously injured by the proposed arrangement, in \n\n[303 \nU.S. 315, 322]\n\u00a0\n spite of the continuing obligation of Milwaukee to pay it a minimum of $27, 000 per annum until 1951.\n If a carrier not a party, but adversely affected, is 'involved' in the sense of section 5(1), Escanaba's assent is a condition precedent to authorization by the Commission. We must then determine the meaning of the phrase as used in the statute. Aid is afforded by the context. The section gives the Commission authority to approve and authorize, 'if assented to by all the carriers involved, ... under such rules and regulations, and for such consideration as between such carriers and upon such terms and conditions,' as the Commission shall find just and reasonable. This reference to the mutual considerations to be exchanged by 'such carriers' shows that Congress meant by the phrase 'all the carriers involved' those, and those only, who are parties to the pooling of freights and the division of the proceeds. Escanaba, however, insists that, if the section is to be construed to require the assent of none but the parties to the pooling agreement, it is mere surplusage. It points out that Milwaukee and Northwestern have assented and are now merely asking the approval and authorization of the Commission. The argument, however, overlooks the fact that the Commission may authorize pooling on the application of a single carrier or upon its own initiative. In the first case the assent of one or more other carriers, and in the second the assent of all the carriers, is a prerequisite to its action. It appears, therefore, that, though confined to the parties to the pool, the requirement that all carriers involved shall assent has a proper office in the statutory scheme.\n Third. In view of Escanaba's relation to the traffic involved in the proposed pool, the decision that its assent is a prerequisite to the plan's operation would involve the gravest inconvenience and perhaps render the provision of section 5(1) nugatory. It is difficult to conceive of any pooling arrangement between two carriers which will not affect, in a greater or less degree, other carriers who inter- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 315, 323]\n\u00a0\n change traffic with one or the other of the pooling roads, or with their connections. If the private interest of any such outside carrier should move it to refuse its assent to the arrangement, it could, in the view urged by the appellant, veto the proposal, although, on the whole and in the long view, the consummation of the plan might greatly enhance the economies of operation of large and important carriers and so promote the public interest. We cannot believe that every carrier, in such sense affected by a proposed pool to which it is not a party, was intended to have a status different from, and perhaps at war with, the interest of the general public in the efficient and economical operation of the railroads envisaged by the Transportation Act.\n We conclude that not only the words of the statute but the obvious policy and intent underlying its provisions require an affirmance of the judgment of the District Court. So ordered.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 21 F.Supp. 151. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Pooling of Ore Traffic in Wisconsin and Michigan, 210 I.C.C. 599; Id., 219 I.C.C. 285. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Act of Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 380, as amended by Transportation Act of Feb. 28, 1920, c. 91,  407, 41 Stat. 480, U.S.C. tit. 49,  5(1), 49 U.S.C.A.  5(1). \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] They were represented before the Commission by their respective trustees appointed under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended, 11 U.S.C.A.  205. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] U.S.C. tit. 49,  1(18), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(18). \n\n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEX PARTE CENTURY INDEM.

Sweet, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellee Nelson.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n On an appeal from a judgment for the plaintiff in an action at law, in which a jury was waived, the Circuit Court of Appeals refused to consider certain assignments of error upon the ground that they related to findings requested by the defendant after the trial had been concluded. The judgment was affirmed (Century Indemnity Co. v. Nelson, 9 Cir., 90 F. 2d 644) and certiorari was granted, \n302 \nU.S. 674\n, 58 S.Ct. 55. We were unable to accept the conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals that when the trial court ordered 'that judgment be entered for plaintiff, with interest and costs, upon findings of fact and conclusions of law to be presented', it was thereafter 'too late adequately to present special findings of fact'. It was not necessary to treat the first order for judgment as ending 'the progress of the trial'. 28 U.S.C.  875, 28 U. S.C.A.  875. The qualifying words in the order were appropriate to suggest a 'reservation of opportunity for further action'. Accordingly, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was reversed and the cause was remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion of this Court. Century Indemnity Company v. Nelson, \n303 \nU.S. 213\n, 58 S.Ct. 531.\n On the later hearing, the Circuit Court of Appeals found another ground for its action,-a ground not dealt with in its former ruling and not presented by the petition for certiorari. That was that defendant's proposed \n\n[305 \nU.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n findings were 'not incorporated in the bill of exceptions, either directly or by reference'. The Circuit Court of Appeals refused to consider the assignments of error addressed to the rejection of these findings and again affirmed the judgment. 9 Cir., 96 F.2d 679.\n On application of the defendant, this Court issued a rule directing the judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals to show cause why the judgment should not be vacated and the court be required to consider the assignments of error. The judges have made return to the rule.\n While it appears from the bill of exceptions that the defendant 'served and lodged its proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law', and the transcript contains a paper described as defendant's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, that paper is not included in the bill of exceptions and hence is not properly authenticated. 28 U.S.C.  875, 28 U.S.C.A.  875; Mercantile Mut.

Huber, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On January 6, 1936, the Federal Power Commission instituted an investigation to determine the 'conditions, practices, and matters regarding the ownership, operation, management, and control' of the respondent corpora- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 375, 377]\n\u00a0\n tions. The order directed respondents to file with the Commission copies of contracts and statements of working arrng ements between respondents and persons controlling them, and statements of charges on respondents' books for 1934 and 1935 representing payments made and obligations incurred to such persons. Respondents were also directed to make their books, records, etc., available for examination by the Commission's representatives. The investigation was instituted on representations of the Governor and Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania.\n Respondents challenged the jurisdiction of the Commission to make the order, and, reserving their right to question its legality, they furnished various data and information. Following an examination of the books and records of respondents, the Commission's examiners submitted a report on December 10, 1936\n\n\n Thereupon the Commission on January 26, 1937, made an order providing that a hearing should be held on March 3, 1937. The order recited that the respondents had reported charges appearing upon their books which represented payments made and obligations incurred to named persons as (a) 'conceded affiliates' and (b) 'not conceded affiliates,' respectively; that the examination of the books and records of respondents and of admitted affiliates disclosed transactions between respondents and additional named persons, and that the accounting representatives of the Commission had submitted a report indicating that certain named persons 'control respondents, or are controlled by the same persons which control respondents.' The order then directed respondents to appear at the hearing, as stated, and to present information bearing upon the question of control and specifically showing (1) their form of organization, respectively, (2) their articles of incorporation, partnership agreements or other documents of organi- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 375, 378]\n\u00a0\n zation, (3) the names and addresses of partners, directors, officers, trustees and agents, (4) the ownership held by such persons 'in or over any other person named above,' as well as the manner by which such ownership was maintained, and (5) such other data as might from time to time be required by the Commission. The order further directed that a copy of the report prepared by the accounting representatives of the Commission should be served on each person named, and the Commission gave notice that the hearing would be had by the Commission sitting jointly with the Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania. See Federal Power Act,  209(b), as amended by Act Aug. 26, 1935,  213, 49 Stat. 853, 16 U.S.C.A.  824h(b).\n Respondents then filed with the Commission a petition for rehearing as to the order of January 26, 1937, asking for the vacating of that order and the termination of the proceeding initiated by the order of January 6, 1936. Respondents contended that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to conduct an investigation concerning the propriety of contracts and working arrangements between respondents and third persons, and, in particular, (1) that the Commission was without power to investigate for the purpose of supplying information to a state commission for use in local proceedings for violations of local law, and, (2) that as to three of the respondents the Commission was without jurisdiction of their persons because they were not 'public utilities' as defined in the Federal Power Act.\n The Commission thereupon adjourned without day the hearing directed by the order of January 26, 1937. Later, the Commission granted the petition for rehearing and assigned 'the matters involved' for hearing on April 14, 1937. Respondents then appeared and introduced evidence tending to support their objections to the Commission's jurisdiction. The Commission's counsel then in- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 375, 379]\n\u00a0\n troduced evidence on its behalf. Respondents objected to its admissibility upon the ground that it was immaterial to the issues presented by the petition for rehearing. Their objection was overruled and respondents then asked the examiner to certify to the Commission the request to define the issues to be determined on the petition for rehearig and to instruct its representatives that no evidence in furtherance of the orders of January 6, 1936, and January 26, 1937, be introduced. The examiner refused and respondents then presented a like request to the Commission, which was denied on April 20, 1937, for the reason that its rules of practice did not provide for that method 'of interim review of the examiner's rulings.' Upon remand to the examiner, he again ruled against respondents, stating that their rights could 'be amply protected by the usual method of exceptions' and argument thereon.\n Respondents then presented, on April 21, 1937, to the Circuit Court of Appeals a petition asking for a rule to show cause why the Commission should not be restrained from taking any steps in furtherance of the inquiry under the orders of January 6, 1936, or of January 26, 1937, until the petition for rehearing had been disposed of, and from introducing any evidence except that which was relevant to the questions raised by the petition for rehearing. The Circuit Court of Appeals, on July 6, 1937, issued the rule to show cause, as prayed, returnable on October 4, 1937, and on September 7, 1937, granted a temporary stay. The Commission made its return to the rule and asked for a dismissal of the petition. The Circuit Court of Appeals rendered its decision on January 27, 1938. Its decree remanded the case to the Commission 'for determination in accordance with the opinion' of the court and restrained the Commission 'from proceeding with its proposed inquiry and investigation in \n\n[304 \nU.S. 375, 380]\n\u00a0\n accordance with its two orders of January 6, 1936, and January 26, 1937, until the questions raised in the petition for rehearing are determined by it.'\n In its opinion the court stated that the only issues of fact raised by the petition for rehearing and the evidence of the respondents were that three of the respondents were not 'public utilities' as defined by the Federal Power Act and that the purpose of the investigation was to supply information to the Pennsylvania Commission for use in local proceedings designed to impose penalties under the state law. 3 Cir., 94 F. 2d 943, 945. The court said (page 946):\n'Coming to the merits of the case, when the petition was filed and granted it was the plain duty of the Federal Commission to determine the issues raised in the petition. We are going to remand the case for such determination. In doing so the evidence admitted should be strictly confined to the two issues raised in the petition and not extended to the scope of the investigation proposed in the orders of January 6, 1936, and January 26, 1937. The relation of the evidence to the two questions involved should be apparent and logical and not far-fetched and remotely inferential. Some of the evidence admitted when the case was before the Federal Commission on rehearing was not relevant and material. If both sides will seek to produce only such evidence as is clearly admissible, we venture to hope that the determination of the issues will be speedy, final and satisfactory.\n\n'In remanding the case, we express no opinion on the merits of the questions to be decided. The determination of them is for the Federal Commission under relevant and competent evidence. The act has provided a review by this court of the orders of the Federal Commission, and no order on the merits is now before us. These proceedings were taken so that the questions would not be moot if and when they come here.' \n\n[304 \nU.S. 375, 381]\n\u00a0\n This Court granted certiorari, \n304 \nU.S. 553\n, 58 S.Ct. 947, 82 L.Ed . --, and the cause has been argued. We are of the opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to enter the decree.\n\n First.-There was no order of the Commission before the Circuit Court of Appeals for review. Apart from the question whether the order of January 6, 1936, or that of January 26, 1937, can be regarded as reviewable, no application for such a review had been made.\n The provision conferring appellate jurisdiction on the Circuit Court of Appeals i r elation to orders of the Federal Power Commission is found in section 313 of the Federal Power Act, as amended by the Act of August 26, 1935, c. 687,  213, 49 Stat. 860, 861, 16 U.S.C.A.  825l. \n1\n Section 313(a) provides \n\n[304 \nU.S. 375, 382]\n\u00a0\n that any person aggrieved by an order of the Commission may apply for a rehearing within thirty days after its issuance and that no proceeding to review any order of the Commission shall be brought unless there has been an application for a rehearing thereon.\n Respondents say that under this provision they could not ask review of the order of January 26, 1937, until they had sought a rehearing. They did seek a rehearing and it was granted N o appeal from the order granting it would lie and none was attempted. Respondents do not contend that there was any appeal from an order, or any application for a review of an order, pending before the Circuit Court of Appeals. On the contrary, respondents say that the Commission 'has never passed upon \n\n[304 \nU.S. 375, 383]\n\u00a0\n the objections raised in respondents' petition for rehearing with respect to the order of January 26, 1937'; that 'concededly, the minute of the Commission granting a rehearing did not purport to decide the objections raised in the petition for rehearing'; and that 'until the Commission has made an order determining those objections, respondents will not be in a position to perfect an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals should the Commission's determination make that necessary.'\n Second.-Respondents seek to sustain the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals by virtue of the authority conferred by section 262 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  377, which provides that the federal courts shall have power 'to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.' The argument is that the Circuit Court of Appeals could intervene to protect its prospective appellate jurisdiction. We are of the opinion that this contention is unsound and that the Circuit Court of Appeals in the circumstances disclosed had no appellate jurisdiction to protect.\n The argument proceeds on the view that the order of January 26, 1937, despite its preliminary character, was a reviewable order subject only to the requirement that an application for rehearing should first be made. Reliance is placed on section 313(b) of the Federal Power Act that 'Any party to a proceeding under this Act (chapter) aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission in such proceeding may obtain a review of such order in the Circuit Court of Appeals.' But neither this language, nor that of section 313(a), should be construed as authorizing a review of every order that the Commission may make, albeit of a merely procedural character. Such a construction, affording opportunity for constant delays in the course of the administrative proceeding for the purpose of re- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 375, 384]\n\u00a0\n viewing mere procedural requirements or interlocutory directions, would do violence to the manifest purpose of the provision.\n The context in section 313(b) indicates the nature of the orders which are subject to review. Upon service of the petition for review, the Commission is to certify and file with the appellate court 'a transcript of the record upon which the order complained of was entered.' The statute contemplates a case in which the Commission has taken evidence and made findings. Its findings, if supported by evidence, are to be conclusive. The appellate court may order additional evidence to be taken by the Commission and the Commission may thereupon make modified or new findings. The provision for review thus relates to orders of a definitive character dealing with the merits of a proceeding before the Commission and resulting from a hearing upon evidence and supported by findings appropriate to the case.\n There are persuasive analogies in the construction of provisions for the review of the orders of other administrative bodies. The Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913,2 provides for cases brought to enjoin, set aside, or suspend 'any order' of the Interstate Commerce Commission. But this Court has held that 'there are many orders of the Commission which are not judicially reviewable under (this) provision.' See United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. Co., \n273 \nU.S. 299, 309\n, 47 S.Ct. 413, 414, and cases cited. In United States v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 82\n, 37 S.Ct. 584, the Interstate Commerce Commission had made an order for a hearing upon an issue of reparation. The Railroad Company contended that the Commission had no jurisdiction to awrd damages in the case presented. A decree of the District Court, enjoining the Commission from proceeding with the hearing, was re- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 375, 385]\n\u00a0\n versed by this Court with directions to dismiss the petition. The 'order' was not of the sort which brought it within the purview of the statute. It was a mere step in procedure. See, also, New York, Ontario & Western Ry. Co. v. United States, D.C., 14 F.2d 850, affirmed \n273 \nU.S. 652\n, 47 S.Ct. 334. Negative orders of the Commission are not reviewable. Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 282\n, 32 S.Ct. 761; Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 412, 414\n, 37 S.Ct. 397. A final report by the Commission on value under section 19a of the Interstate Commerce Act, though called an order, is not reviewable. United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. Co., supra. Compare United States v. Atlanta, Birmingham & Coast R. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 522, 527\n, 51 S.Ct. 237, 238; Great Northern Railway Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 172, 181\n, 182 S., 48 S.Ct. 466, 467, 468; United States v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 226\n, 58 S.Ct. 601, decided February 28, 1938; Shannahan v. United States, \n303 \nU.S. 596\n, 58 S. Ct. 732, decided April 4, 1938. With respect to other regulatory bodies, it has been held that mere preliminary or procedural orders are not within the statutes providing for review by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Chamber of Commerce v. Federal Trade Commission, 8 Cir., 280 F. 45, 48; Ames Baldwin Wyoming Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 4 Cir., 73 F.2d 489, 490; Jones v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 2 Cir., 79 F.2d 617, 619; Id., \n298 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 56 S.Ct. 654, 657. So, attempts to enjoin administrative hearings because of a supposed or threatened injury, and thus obtain judicial relief before the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted, have been held to be at war with the longsettled rule of judicial administration. Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, \n303 \nU.S. 41\n, 58 S.Ct. 459, decided January 31, 1938. See, also, Securities and Exchange Commission v. Andrews, 2 Cir., 88 F.2d 441.\n The Commission's order of January 26, 1937, (a) fixed a date for hearing, (b) required respondents to appear, and (c) required them to produce the information and documents described. In fixing a date for hearing, the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 375, 386]\n\u00a0\n order was nothing more than a notice. United States v. Illinois Central R. Co., supra, page 89, 37 S.Ct. 584. The statute confers no authority upon the Commission to enforce its directions to appear, testify or produce books and papers save by application to a federal court under section 307( c).3 Upon such an application, the court may require attendance, testimony and the production of books and papers touching the matter under investigation and failure to obey such an order of the court may be punished by it as a contempt. We think that this provision embraces all cases of alleged 'contumacy' on the part of any person who is required to attend, give testimony, or produce documents. Upon such an application by the Commission for the enforcement of its order, respondents would have full opportunity to contest its validity. See Jones v. Securities and Exchange Commission, supra. In the in- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 375, 387]\n\u00a0\n stant case no such application by the Commission has been made. Section 307(c) also provides that any person who willfully fails or refuses to attend and testify, or produce books and papers, in obedience to the subpoena of the Commission, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to fine and imprisonment. The qualification that the refusal must be 'willful' fully protects one whose refusal is made in good faith and upon grounds which entitle him to the judgment of the court before obedience is compelled.\n The Commission's order of January 26, 1937, lay outside any appellate jurisdiction conferred by the statute upon the Circuit Court of Appeals. In that view, section 262 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  377, gives no support to the decree under review and its injunction and instructions to the Commission must be regarded as unauthorized.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to dismiss the respondents' petition. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 313.

GOODYEAR TIRE & R. CO.(1938)\nNo. 756\nArgued: April 25, 1938Decided: May 16, 1938\n\n\n\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Hugh B. Cox, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n In September, 1933, the Federal Trade Commission charged respondent, the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, with the violation of section 2 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  13, 15 U.S.C.A.  13, in selling tires, tubes, etc., to Sears, Roebuck & Company at discriminatory prices. Respondent, invok- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 257, 258]\n\u00a0\n ing the first proviso in section 2,1 contended that its contracts with Sears, Roebuck & Company for sales involving lower net prices than those charged to independent dealers were made because of the great difference in the quantities sold. After hearing, the Commission ruled that it did not consider a difference in price to be on account of quantity unless it was based on a difference in cost and was reasonably related to and approximately no more than that difference. In March, 1936, the Commission issued an order requiring respondent to desist from discriminations in prices as described.\n Pending the hearing in the Circuit Court of Appeals of respondent's petition for review, the Congress amended section 2 of the Clayton Act. Act of June 19, 1936, c. 592, 49 Stat. 1526, 15 U.S.C.A.  13. The first proviso was amended to read as follows: 'Provided, That nothing herein contained shall prevent differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered.'\n Thereupon, respondent informed the Circuit Court of Appeals that in view of this provision respondent had ceased to manufacture tires for Sears, Roebuck & Company under the terms of its existing contract; that, to dispose of the stock on hand, the parties had made a new price arrangement designed to conform to the new law; and that within the year all transactions between re- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 257, 259]\n\u00a0\n spondent and Sears, Roebuck & Company ceased and obligations were terminated by mutual releases. 6 Cir., 92 F.2d 677, 679.\n Considering that there was no controversy between the parties as to the illegal character of respondent's practices under the amended Act, the Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the case had become moot. In that view the court set aside the order of the Commission and remanded the case 'but without direction to the Commission to dismiss the complaint and without prejudice to its filing a supplemental complaint in the original proceeding if under section 2 of the amendatory act this may now be done' as to which the court expressed no opinion. 92 F.2d 677, at page 681.\n Both the Commission and the respondent contended below, and contend here, that the case has not become moot. While they disagree in their reasoning, they come to the same conclusion upon this point, and both ask that the case be remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals with directions to determine it upon the merits. We think that their conclusion is correct and that the remand should be made.\n Section 11 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  21, 15 U.S.C.A.  21 provides that whenever the Commission has reason to believe that any person is violating or has violated the provisions of the Act, and upon hearing so finds, the Commission shall issue an order requiring such person to cease and desist from such violations. In case of failure to obey its order, the Commission may apply to the Circuit Court of Appeals for enforcement. And anyone required to cease and desist from a violation charged may seek review in the Circuit Court of Appeals, praying that the order be set aside. The provisions of the Act of June 19, 1936, show clearly that the orders of the Commission entered before its passage are to remain in effect. Section 2 of that Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  21a, provides that nothing therein contained shall 'affect \n\n[304 \nU.S. 257, 260]\n\u00a0\n rights of action arising, or litigation pending, or orders of the Federal Trade Commission issued and in effect or pending on review, based on section 2 of said Act of October 15, 1914, (section 13 of this title) prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act (June 19, 1936).'\n Discontinuance of the practice which the Commission found to constitute a violation of the Act did not render the controversy moot. United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, \n166 \nU.S. 290, 309\n, 310 S., 17 S.Ct. 540; Southern Pacific Company v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 \nU.S. 433, 452\n, 31 S.Ct. 288; Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 \nU.S. 498\n, 514-516, 31 S.Ct. 279; National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, \n303 \nU.S. 261\n, 58 S.Ct. 571, 115 A.L.R. 307, decided February 28, 1938; Guarantee Veterinary Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 2 Cir., 285 F. 853, 859, 860; Chamber of Commerce v. Federal Trade Commission, 8 Cir., 13 F.2d 673, 686, 687. The Commission, reciting its findings and the conclusion that respondent had violated the act, required respondent to cease and desist from the particular discriminations which the order described. That is a continuing order. Its efficacy, if valid, was not affected by the subsequent passage or the provisions of the amendatory Act. As a continuing order, the Commission may take proceedings for its enforcement if it is disobeyed. But under the statute respondent was entitled to seek review of the order and to have it set aside if found to be invalid. The question which both parties sought to have the Circuit Court of Appeals decide was whether respondent's conduct was a violation of the original statute. Upon the conclusion that it was such a violation, the Commission based its order. Neither the transactions subsequent to that order nor the passage of the amendatory Act deprived the respondent of its right to challenge the order and to have its validity determined or the Commission of its right to have its order maintained if validly made. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 257, 261]\n\u00a0\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court for a determination of the merits.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice STONE, Mr. Justice CARDOZO, and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That proviso, in the original Act, was as follows:\n'Provided, That nothing herein contained shall prevent discrimination in price between purchasers of commodities on account of differences in the grade, quality, or quantity of the commodities sold, or that makes only due allowance for difference in the cost of selling or transportation, or discrimination in price in the same or different communities made in good faith to meet competition.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFOSTER v. UNITED STATES(1938)\nNo. 189\nArgued: Decided: January 31, 1938\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. P. McCool, of New York City, and Hugh C. Bickford, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n Arnold Raum, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner's right (as executors) to an income tax refund depends upon whether a dividend paid by the Foster Lumber Company in 1930 is tax exempt as representing corporate earnings accumulated before March 1, 1913. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 118, 119]\n\u00a0\n This dividend is taxable under the Revenue Act of 19281 if paid from earnings accumulated after 1913. The Court of Claims found the dividend taxable. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioners contend that the 1930 dividend was traceable to the Company's pre-1913 accumulations because its post-1913 earnings had been exhausted by a distribution in 1929. The circumstances of the 1929 distribution and the 1930 dividend were:\n The Foster Lumber Company was a family corporation, organized in 1896 with a capital stock of $200,000. March 1, 1913, when the federal income tax became effective, the increased value of the company's property and its undistributed profits were more than $3,725,000. Petitioners insist that a distribution of $1,025,000 on October 10, 1929, completely exhausted the $330,578.98 total undistributed profits which had accumulated since March 1, 1913. This 1929 distribution, however, was not a dividend. It was paid by the company to cancel and liquidate five hundred shares of its own $100 par value stock and represented payment of $ 2,050 per share, the agreed value as of March, 1913. February 11, 1930, the company declared a $225,000 dividend and this refund is sought for the tax paid upon a shareholder's part of this dividend. Between October 10, 1929 (the date of the $1,025,000 stock purchase) and February 11, 1930 ( the date of the $225,000 dividend) the company's earnings amounted to only $ 82,758.17. Petitioners take the position that only $82,758.17 of this $225, 000 dividend of 1930 can be taxed, urging that the balance is tax exempt because it must be treated as representing pre-1913 accumulations.\n Subsection (a) of section 115 of the Revenue Act of 19283 defines 'dividend,' for income tax purposes, as 'any \n\n[303 \nU.S. 118, 120]\n\u00a0\n distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders, ... out of its earnings or profits accumulated after February 28, 1913.'\n Subsection (b) of this income tax law exempts corporate earnings and profits accumulated before March 1, 1913. This subsection also provides that for income tax purposes all distributions are paid from 'the most recently accumulated earnings or profits.' The obvious purpose of the provision was to prevent corporations from attributing dividend payments to pre-1913 accumulations to avoid taxes imposed upon profits earned after March, 1913. Petitioners' contention is that the $330,578.98 earned after 1913, as 'the most recently accumulated earnings or profits' was automatically exhausted in part payment of the $1,025,000 stock purchase and thus escaped taxation. In this manner, pre-1913 corporate nontaxable earnings could be used to avoid taxes on corporate profits earned after 1913\n\n\n We have previously said that subsections (a) and (b), supra, construed together, disclose legislative purpose that pre-1913 accumulations shall not be distributed 'in such a fashion as to permit profits accumulated after that date to escape taxation.' \n4\n Petitioners ask that we now construe these provisions in a way which would facilitate the escape of such profits from taxation and thereby defeat the undoubted purpose of Congress. We are urged so to expand and broaden an exemption granted by Congress as a 'concession to the equity of stockholders'5 that such concession would in reality serve to nullify and defeat the tax on corporate profits earned after 1913. Courts should construe laws in harmony with the legislative intent and seek to carry out legislative purpose. With respect to the tax provisions under consideration, there is no uncertainty as to the legislative purpose to \n\n[303 \nU.S. 118, 121]\n\u00a0\n tax post-1913 corporate earnings. We must not give effect to any contrivance which would defeat a tax Congress plainly intended to impose. The use of bookkeeping terms and accounting forms and devices cannot be permitted to devitalize valid tax laws.\n The transaction under which this company paid $1,025,000 cash for its own stock of $50,000 par value does not fall within subsections (a) and (b) of section 115. Its character and effect are determined by subsections (c) and (h) which relate to distributions in complete or partial corporate liquidation. \n 6\n\u00a0\n\n Subsection (c), governing this stock purchase transaction, directs that 'In the case of amounts distributed in partial liquidation ... the part of such distribution which is properly chargeable to capital account shall not be consdered a distribution of earnings or profits within the meaning of subsection (b) ... for the purpose of determining the taxability of subsequent distributions.' \n7\n\u00a0\n\n This provision of the Revenue Act of 1928 also substantially obtained in the Revenue Act of 1924.8 Prior even to the 1924 act, this Court had determined that, for income tax purposes, earnings of a corporation accumulated prior to 1913 are to be considered capital. \n9\n In the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 118, 122]\n\u00a0\n light of these decisions, Congress obviously intended that corporate funds distributed under the circumstances here shown should be 'chargeable to capital account' and that stock purchases of the type here involved should not be considered 'for the purpose of determining the taxability of subsequent distributions by the corporation.'\n Acceptance of petitioners' contention would permit corporate profits accumulated since March, 1913, to escape taxation, contrary to the provisions and purpose of the 1928 Revenue Act. The bookkeeping mingling of corporate earnings and profits made before and after March 1, 1913, does not alter the act nor can such action render taxable profits non- taxable. In this case, the distribution of $1,025,000 was 'properly chargeable to capital account' and was not paid out of profits earned since March 1, 1913.\n The $1,025,000, paid for the company's stock, cannot, therefore, be considered 'for the purpose of determining the taxability of subsequent distributions by the corporation' and this purchase of stock did not exhaust any part of the $330,578.98 profits accumulated since 1913.

Clark and Hubert Howson, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Samuel E. Darby, Jr., of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice REED, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, General Electric Company, brought this patent infringement suit based on Pacz patent, No. 1,410,499, relating to a tungsten filament for incandescent lamps. The patent, issued March 21, 1922, on an application filed February 20, 1917, contains process and product claims; only the latter are here involved. The District Court for Eastern New York held claims 25, 26, and 27 valid and infringed, and gave petitioner a decree for an injunction and accounting. 17 F.Supp. 901. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that petitioner's product was anticipated by filament produced under the teachings of the Coolidge patent, No. 1,082,933, and reversed with directions to dismiss the bill of complaint. 91 F.2d 904. This decision conflicted with that handed down by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Anraku v. General Electric Co., 80 F.2d 958, which held \n\n[304 \nU.S. 364, 366]\n\u00a0\n the same claims valid and infringed. To resolve the conflict, this Court granted certiorari. \n302 \nU.S. 676\n, 58 S.Ct. 143, 82 L.Ed. --.\n In incandescent lamps, the tungsten filament, through which the electric current passes, grows more luminous than the carbon filament of the early days of the art. There were faults of 'offsetting' and 'sagging,' however, affecting the efficiency of the first tungsten filaments. 'Offsetting' occurs when, during heating in the use of the lamp, the filament forms crystals which extend their boundaries across the entire diameter of the filament, substantially perpendicular to its axis. The crystals in the filament thus come to have an appearance, somewhat analogous to the joints in a bamboo rod. Lateral slipping of the crystals reduces the cross-sectional area at the point of contact of the crystals with the result that the temperature at that point is increased, thus hastening the burnout, and the filament is weakened. 'Sagging' is a change of position by the filament during incandescence. It elongates and thus is forced out of the plane it occupied between fixed supports. Sagging has many objections. The sagging filament may touch the glass and end the life of the lamp. In gas-filled lamps, when sagging causes the coils to spread apart, the gas flows in between the coils and unduly cools the filament. Combatting sagging by additional supports is also said to cool the filament, and reduce electrical efficiency.\n Pacz undertook to remedy these faults. He carried out many experiments, and his 218th effort, made while he was in the employ of petitioner company, yielded the discovery disclosed by the patent in suit. The specification asserts that by means of his invention 'the sagging is substantially eliminated and 'offsetting' of the filament is substantially prevented, during a normal or commercially useful life of the lamp.' He brings 'into intimate \n\n[304 \nU.S. 364, 367]\n\u00a0\n association with tungsten a material (an alkaline silicate) which will have the desired influence upon the grain growth of the metal.' The specification continues as follows:\n'When the meta r eaches the temperature at which extensive grain growth would ordinarily take place, the presence of this material intimately associated with the tungsten particles has a marked effect on the shape and size of the tungsten grains. The ingot of tungsten thus produced, whether it be due to the fact that the grains have not reached the equilibrium grain size or to other causes, is particularly susceptible to grain growth during subsequent heat treatments.\n\n'The probable reason why filaments made according to my invention do not sag, is that the structure is comparatively coarse grained. The coarse grained filament produced by means of my invention does not 'offset' so as to cut short the life of the lamp appreciably.'\n\n The District Court found that Pacz's patent exhibited novelty and invention; that Pacz produced large crystals early in the life of the lamp; that although coarsegrained, and thus non-sagging, filaments meant 'offsetting' to the art, where it was 'common knowledge' that grains large enough to extend across the filament induced slippage, Pacz procured a particular kind of coarse-grained filament which did not 'offset' because of the nature of the boundaries of the grains, their contour being 'a very important element.'\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the Pacz product was anticipated by patent No. 1,082,933, issued December 30, 1913, to William D. Coolidge for a process of producing ductile tungsten for incandescent electric lamp filaments and for the product itself. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 364, 368]\n\u00a0\n The question before this Court is the validity of the claims in suit. Claim 25, which is typical,1 reads as follows: '25. A filament for electric incandescent lamps or other devices, composed substantially of tungsten and made up mainly of a number of comparatively large grains of such size and contour as to prevent substantial sagging and offsetting during a normal or commercially useful life for such a lamp or other device.'\n We need not inquire whether Pacz exhibited invention, or whether his product was anticipated. The claim is invalid on its face. It fails to make a disclosure sufficiently definite to satisfy the requirements of R.S .  4888, 35 U.S.C.  33, 35 U.S.C.A.  33. That section requires that an applicant for a patent file a written description of his discovery or invention 'in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it appertains ... to make, construct, compound, and use the same; ... and he shall particularly point out and distinctly claim the part, improvement, or combination which he claims as his invention or discovery.' We may assume that Pacz has sufficiently informed those skilled in the art how to make and use his filament. The statute has another command. Recognizing that most inventions represent improvements on some existing article, process, or machine, and that a description of the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 364, 369]\n\u00a0\n invention must in large part set out what is old in order to facilitate the understanding of what is new, Congress requires of the applicant 'a distinct and specific statement of what he claims to be new, and to be his invention.' \n2\n Patents, whether basic or for improvements, must comply accurately and precisely with the statutory requirement as to claims of invention or discovery. The limits of a paen t must be known for the protection of the patentee, the encouragement of the inventive genius of others, and the assurance that the subject of the patent will be dedicated ultimately to the public. \n3\n The statute seeks to guard against unreasonable advantages to the patentee and disadvantages to others arising from uncertainty as to their rights. \n4\n The inventor must 'inform the public during the life of the patent of the limits of the monopoly asserted, so that it may be known which features may be safely used or manufactured without a license and which may not.' \n5\n The claims 'measure the invention.' 6 Patentees may reasonably anticipate that claimed inventions, improvements, and discoveries, turning on points so refined as the granular structure of products, require precise descriptions of the new characteristic for which protection is sought. In a limited field the variant must be clearly defined. This was one in a series of patents. United States v. General Electric Co., \n272 \nU.S. 476, 480\n, 47 S.Ct. 192.\n Pacz did not adequately set out 'what he claims to be new.' The tungsten filament 'made up mainly of a number of comparatively large grains,' differentiates the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 364, 370]\n\u00a0\n claimed invention from tungsten drawn into a single crystal (Schaller, No. 1,256,930), and from Coolidge's fine-grained thoriated filament, but serves aptly to describe the product of earlier manufacture, with its large regular grains subject to offsetting. According to the District Court, the earliest, so-called 'squirted,' tungsten filaments, also 'consisted of comparatively large crystals, many of which were large enough to extend clear across the filament, but they shifted.' 17 F.Supp. 901, at page 902. The failure of the patentee to make claim to a distinct improvement is made clear by comparison of the language of the claims under consideration with descriptions of offset difficulties recognized by other inventors. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The claim further states that the grains must be 'of such size and contour as to prevent substantial sagging and offsetting' during a commercially useful life for the lamp. The clause is inadequate as a description of the structural characteristics of the grains. Apart from the statement with respect to their function, nothing said about their size distinguishes the earliest filaments, and nothing whatever is said which is descriptive of their contour (termed by the District Court a 'very important element'), not even that they are irregular. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 364, 371]\n\u00a0\n The claim uses indeterminate adjectives which describe the function of the grains to the exclusion of any structural definition, and thus falls within the condemnation of the doctrine that a patentee may not broaden his product claims by describing he product in terms of function. 8 Claim 25 vividly illustrates the vice of a description in terms of function. 'As a description of the invention, it is insufficient, and, if allowed, would extend the monopoly beyond the invention.' \n9\n The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit relied on the fact that the description in the claims is not 'wholly' functional. \n10\n Anraku v. General Electric Co., 80 F.2d 958, 963. But the vice of a functional claim exists not only when a claim is 'wholly' functional, if that is ever true, but also when the inventor is painstaking when he recites what has already been seen, and then uses conveniently functional language at the exact point of novelty. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n A limited use of terms of effect or result, which accurately define the essential qualities of a product to one skilled in the art, may in some instances be permissible and even desirable, but a characteristic essential to nov- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 364, 372]\n\u00a0\n elty may not be distinguished from the old art solely by its tendency to remedy the problems in the art met by the patent. And we may doubt whether the language used in claim 25, taken by itself, conveyed definite meaning to those skilled in the art of incandescent lighting. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals below suggested that 'In view of the difficulty, if not impossibility, of describing adequately a number of microscopic and heterogeneous shapes of crystals, it may be that Pacz made the best disclosure possible ....' Page 905 of 91 F.2d. But Congress requires, for the protection of the public, that the inventor set out a definite limitation of his patent; that condition must be satisfied before the monopoly is granted. 13 The difficulty of making adequate description may have some bearing on the sufficiency of the description attempted, but it cannot justify a claim describing nothing new except per- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 364, 373]\n\u00a0\n haps in functional terms. It may be doubted whether one who discovers or invents a product be knows to be new will ever find it impossible to describe some aspect of its novelty.\n The product claims here involved cannot be validated by reference to the specification. Assuming that in a proper case a claim may be upheld by reference to the descriptive part of the specification in order to give definite content to elements stated in the claim in broad or functional terms, 14 the specification of the Pacz patent does not attempt in any way to describe the filament, except by mention of its coarsegrained quality. Even assuming that definiteness may be imparted to the product claim by that part of the specification which purportedly details only a method of making the product,15 the description of the Pacz process is likewise silent as to the nature of the filament product. Although in some instances a claim may validly describe a new product with some reference to the method of production,16 a patentee who does not distinguish his product from what is old except by reference, express or constructive, to the process by which he produced it, cannot secure a monopoly on the product by whatever means produced. 'Every patent for a product or composition of matter must identify it so that it can be recognized aside from the description of the process for making it, or else nothing can be \n\n[304 \nU.S. 364, 374]\n\u00a0\n held to infringe the patent which is not made by that process.' \n 17\n\u00a0\n\n Finally, the product claims may not be saved by a limitation to products produced in accordance with the process set out in the specification. This construction, though possibly of no avail against respondent, might add to the protection afforded petitioner by the process claims, if they are valid, in view of its application to filaments produced abroad. But putting aside questions as to the general propriety of such a construction,18 unless the claim uses language explicitly referring to the method of preparation, or describing the product in phrases suggestive of that process,19 to save the product claim in this fashion would constitute an improper importation into the claim of a factor nowhere described there. \n20\n The claims in suit seek to monopolize the product however created, and may not be reworded, in an effort to establish \n\n[304 \nU.S. 364, 375]\n\u00a0\n their validity, to cover only the products of the process described in the specification, or its equivalent.\n For reasons set out, claims 25, 26, 27 are invalid. The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '26.

In all there were in suit seven patents. The cases were tried together and are treated as one. The lower courts held one of the patents invalid, and that ruling is not challenged here.

This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n302 \nU.S. 674\n, 58 S.Ct. 49, 82 L.Ed. --.\n Under the caption 'Questions Presented' the petition for writ of certiorari submits the following:\n'1. Can the owner of a patent, by means thereof, restrict the use made of a device manufactured under the patent, after the device has passed into the hands of a purchaser in the ordinary channels of trade, and full consideration paid therefor?\n\n'2. Can a patent owner, merely by a 'license notice' attached to a device made under the patent, and sold in the ordinary channels of trade, place an enforceable restriction on the purchaser thereof as to the use to which the purchaser may put the device?\n\n'3. Can an inventor who has filed an application for patent, showing and describing but not claiming certain inventions, obtain a valid patent for said inventions by voluntarily filing a 'divisional' or 'continuation' application for said unclaimed inventions more than two years subsequent to public use of the said unclaimed inventions by him or his assignee or licensee?'\n\n The brief supporting the petition contains specifications of error relating to decision of two other questions. One is whether, by acceptance and retention of royalties paid by the licensed manufacturer, respondents acquiesced in the infringement and are estopped from maintaining the suit. The other is whether the patents upheld are invalid because of anticipation by, or want of invention over, the prior patented art. That brief is confined to the three questions definitely stated in the petition. But petitioner's brief on the merits extends to the additional questions reflected by the specification of errors.\n\n 1. \nOur consideration of the case will be limited to the questions specifically brought forward by the petition. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 175, 178]\n\u00a0\n Rule 38, paragraph 2, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 354, contains the following: 'The petition shall contain only a summary and short statement of the matter involved and the reasons relied on for the allowance of the writ. A supporting brief may be included in the petition, but, whether so included or presented separately, it must be direct, concise, and in conformity with rules 26 and 27. ... A failure to comply with these requirements will be a sufficient reason for denying the petition.' Evidently petitioner, by the 'Questions Presented,' intended to state the issues it deemed to arise on its 'statement of the matter involved,' for neither the petition nor supporting brief purport to apply for review of any other question. Whether included in the petition, or separately presented, the supporting brief is not a part of the petition, at least for the purpose of stating the questions on which review is sought. The specifications of error in that brief do not expand or add to the questions stated in the petition; they serve merely to identify and challenge rulings upon which is grounded ultimate decision of the matter involved.\n There is nothing in the lower courts' decision on either of the added questions to warrant review here. Whether respondents acquiesced in the infringement and are estopped depends upon the facts. Granting of the writ would not be warranted merely to review the evidence or inferences drawn from it.

Crown Cork & Seal Co. v. Gutmann Co., \n304 \nU.S. 159\n, 58 S.Ct. 842, 82 L.Ed . -- decided this day. Petitioner is not here entitled to decision on any question other than those formally presented by its petition for the writ.\n\n 2. \nThe respondent American Telephone & Telegraph Company owns the patents. Amplifiers having these inventions are used in different fields. One, known as the commercial field, includes talking picture equipment for theaters. Another, called the private field, embraces radio broadcast reception, radio amateur reception, and radio experimental reception. The other respondents are subsidiaries of the Telephone Company and exclusive licensees in the commercial field of recording and reproducing sound; during the time of the infringement alleged, they were engaged in making and supplying to theaters talking picture equipment including amplifiers embodying the inventions covered by the patents in suit. The petitioner also furnished to theaters talking picture equipment including amplifiers which embody the invention covered by the patents in suit. Respondents' charge is that by so doing petitioner infringes them.\n The American Transformer Company was one of a number of manufacturers holding nonexclusive licenses limited to the manufacture and sale of the amplifiers for private use, as distinguished from commercial use. These licenses were granted by the Radio Corporation, acting for itself and the respondent Telephone Company, and \n\n[304 \nU.S. 175, 180]\n\u00a0\n were assented to by the latter. The Transformer Company's license was expressly confined to the right to manufacture and sell the patented amplifiers for radio amateur reception, radio experimental reception, and home broadcast reception. It had no right to sell the amplifiers for use in theaters as a part of talking picture equipment.\n Nevertheless, it knowingly did sell the amplifiers in controversy to petitioner for that use. Petitioner admits that the Transformer Company knew that the amplifiers it sold to petitioner were to be used in the motion picture industry. The petitioner, when purchasing from the Transformer Company for that use, had actual knowledge that the latter had no license to make such a sale. In compliance with a requirement of the license, the Transformer Company affixed to amplifiers sold by it under the license a notice stating in substance that the apparatus was licensed only for radio amateur, experimental and broadcast reception under the patents in question. To the amplifiers sold to petitioner outside the scope of the license, it also affixed notices in the form described, but they were intended by both parties to be disregarded.\n Petitioner puts its first question in affirmative form: 'The owner of a patent cannot, by means of the patent, restrict the use made of a device manufactured under the patent after the device has passed into the hands of a purchaser in the ordinary channels of trade and full consideration paid therefor.' But that proposition ignores controlling facts. The patent owner did not sell to petitioner the amplifiers in question or authorize the Transformer Company to sell them or any amplifiers for use in theaters or any other commercial use. The sales made by the Transformer Company to petitioner were outside the scope of its license and not under the patent. Both parties knew that fact at the time of the transactions. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 175, 181]\n\u00a0\n There is no ground for the assumption that petitioner was 'a purchaser in the ordinary channels of trade.'\n The Transformer Company was not an assignee; it did not own the patents or any interest in them; it was a mere licensee under a nonexclusive license, amounting to no more than 'a mere waiver of the right to sue.' De Forest Co. v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 236, 242\n, 47 S.Ct. 366, 368. Pertinent words of the license are these: 'To manufacture ... and to sell only for radio amateur reception, radio experimental reception and radio broadcast reception. ...' Patent owners may grant licenses extending to all uses or limited to use in a defined field. Providence Rubber Company v. Goodyear, 9 Wall. 788, 799, 800; Game-wall Fire-Alarm Telegraph Co. v. Brooklyn, C.C., 14 F. 255; Dorsey Rake Co. v. Bradley Co., 7 Fed.Cas. pp. 946, 947, No. 4,015; Robinson on Patents,  808, 824. Unquestionably, the owner of a patent may grant licenses to manufacture, use, or sell upon conditions not inconsistent with the scope of the monopoly. E. Bement & Sons v. National Harrow Co., \n186 \nU.S. 70, 93\n, 22 S.Ct. 747; United States v. General Elec. Co., \n272 \nU.S. 476, 489\n, 47 S.Ct. 192, 196. There is here no attempt on the part of the patent owner to extend the scope of the monopoly beyond that contemplated by the patent statute. Cf. Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Corp., \n283 \nU.S. 27, 33\n, 51 S.Ct. 334, 336; Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co., \n302 \nU.S. 458\n, 58 S.Ct. 288. There is no warrant for treating the sales of amplifiers to petitioner as if made under the patents or the authority of their owner.

Hawley, 16 Wall. 544, 550. By knowingly making the sales to petitioner outside the scope of its \n\n[304 \nU.S. 175, 182]\n\u00a0\n license, the Transformer Company infringed the patents embodied in the amplifiers. Providence Rubber Co. v. Goodyear, supra; E. Bement & Sons v. National Harrow Co., supra; United States v. General Elec. Co., supra; Vulcan Mfg. Co. v. Maytag Co., 8 Cir., 73 F.2d 136, 139; L. E. Waterman Co. v. Kline, 4 Cir., 234 F. 891, 893; Porter Needle Co. v. National Needle Co ., C.C., 17 F. 536. Petitioner, having with knowledge of the facts bought at sales constituting infringement, did itself infringe the patents embodied in the amplifiers when it leased them for use as talking picture equipment in theaters. Mitchell v. Hawley, supra; American Cotton-Tie Supply Co. v. Bullard, 1 Fed.Cas. pp. 625, 629, 630, No. 294. See Robinson on Patents,  824. See Holiday v. Mattheson, C.C., 24 F. 185, 186; General Electric Co. v. Continental Lamp Works, 2 Cir., 280 F. 846, 851. As petitioner at the time it bought the amplifiers knew that the sales constituted infringement of the patents embodied in them, petitioner's second question, as to effect of the license notice, need not be considered.\n\n 3. \nPetitioner's affirmative statement of its third question is: 'An inventor who has filed an application for patent showing and describing, but not claiming, certain inventions cannot obtain a valid patent for said inventions by voluntarily filing a 'divisional' or 'continuation' application for said unclaimed inventions more than two years subsequent to public use of the said unclaimed inventions by him or his assignee or licensee.' It makes that contention as to four patents: Arnold patent, No. 1,403,475, dated January 17, 1922; Arnold patent, No. 1,465,332, dated April 21, 1923; Arnold pattent, No. 1,329,283, dated January 27, 1920; and Arnold patent, No. 1,448,550, dated March 13, 1923.\n The District Court and Circuit Court of Appeals found that there was no public use of either of the inventions of the first two patents prior to the filing dates of the di- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 175, 183]\n\u00a0\n visional applications upon which they issued. These findings were made upon adequate evidence and petitioner's contentions as to them will not be considered here.\n The subjects matter of the claims of the other two patents were disclosed in the original applications and were claimed in the continuation applications upon which they issued. The patentee's use was the only 'public use' of the inventions covered by them. And that did not precede by as much as two years the filing of the original applications. The effective dates of the claims of the continuation applications are those of the original applications. In the absence of intervening adverse rights for more than two years prior to the continuation applications, they were in time. Rev. St.  4886, as amended, 35 U.S.C.  31, 35 U.S.C.A .  31; Crown Cork & Seal Co. v. Gutmann Co., \n304 \nU.S. 159\n, 58 S.Ct. 842, 82 L.Ed. --, decided this day.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, Mr. Justice CARDOZO, and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n The decisions in this case and Crown Cork & Seal Co. v. Gutmann Co., \n304 \nU.S. 159\n, 58 S.Ct. 842, 82 L.Ed. --, decided this day, will inevitably result in a sweeping expansion of the statutory boundaries constitutionally fixed by Congress to limit the scope and duration of patent monopolies.\n The area of the patent monopoly is expanded by the holding that the exclusive right granted an inventor to 'make, use and vend' his patented commercial device, permits the inventor's corporate assignee (and other 'patent pool' participants) to control how and where the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 175, 184]\n\u00a0\n device can be used by a purchaser who bought it in the open market. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioner bought amplifying tubes from the American Transformer Company, a licensee authorized to 'manufacture ... and sell only for radio amateur reception, radio experimental reception and radio broadcast reception.' The devices are of a standard and uniform type generally useful in many 'fields.'\n We are not here concerned with the right of respondents under the contract with the licensee, American Transformer Company. Respondents do not-in fact, could not-rely on the contract made with the Transformer Company, in this suit against petitioner which in no way was a party to that contract. If the Transformer Company violated its contract, respondents' remedy was by suit against the Transformer Company for the breach. No question of malicious interference with contractual interests is presented. Respondents insist only that under their patents they have the right to control the use of these widely used tubes in the hands of purchasers from one authorized by respondents to manufacture and sell them.\n The mere fact that the purchaser of a standard and uniform piece of electrical equipment has knowledge that his vendor has contracted with an owner of a patent on the equipment not to sell the equipment for certain agreed purposes does not enlarge the scope or effect of the patent \n\n[304 \nU.S. 175, 185]\n\u00a0\n monopoly. The patent statute only gives the patentee the exclusive right to make, use and vend his patented article.\n Where a licensee-authorized to manufacture and sell-contracts with the patentee to attach a notice to each patented article (a machine) of 'the conditions of its use and the supplies which must be used in the operation of it, under pain of infringement of the patent,' this Court has said: 'The statutes relating to patents do not provide for any such notice and (the patentee) can derive no aid from them (in a suit against a purchaser from the licensee). ...\n'The extent to which the use of the patented machine may validly be restricted to specific supplies or otherwise by special contract between the owner of a patent and the purchaser or licensee is a question outside the patent law, and with it we are not concerned.'2\n\n A patentee has no right under the patent laws to fix the resale price of his patented article3 or to require that specified unpatented materials be used in conjunction with it. \n4\n The exclusive right to vend does not-any more than the exclusive right to use-empower a patentee to extend his monopoly into the country's channels of trade after manufacture and sale which passes title. It is not contended that petitioner did not obtain title to the tubes.\n The patent statute which permits a patentee to 'make, use and vend' confers no power to fix and restrict the uses to which a merchantable commodity can be put after \n\n[304 \nU.S. 175, 186]\n\u00a0\n it has been bought in the open market from one who was granted authority to manufacture and sell it. Neither the right to make, nor the right to use, nor the right to sell a chattel, includes the right-derived from patent monopoly apart from contract-to control the use of the same chattel by another who has purchased it. A license to sell a widely used merchantable chattel must be as to prospective purchasers-if anything-a transfer of the patentee's entire right to sell; it cannot-as to noncontracting parties-restrict the use of ordinary articles of purchase bought in the open market. 'The words used in the statute are few, simple, and familiar, ... and their meaning would seem not to be doubtful if we can avoid reading into them that which they really do not contain.' \n5\n Petitioner is held liable for using an ordinary vacuum amplifying tube bought from one who had title and the right to sell. Notice to petitioner that the vendor was violating its (the vendor's) contract with respondents gave the latter no right under the patent and imposed no responsibility on the petitioner under the patent. Petitioner became the owner of the tubes.\n At this time a great portion of the common articles of commerce and trade is patented. A large part of the machinery and equipment used in producing goods throughout the country is patented. Many small parts essential to the operation of machinery are patented. Patented articles are everywhere. Those who acquire control of numerous patents, covering wide fields of industry and business, can-by virtue of their patents-wield tremendous influence on the commercial life of the nation. If the exclusive patent privilege to 'make, use and vend' includes the further privilege after sale, to control-apart from contract-the use of all patented merchantable commodities, a still more sweeping power can be exercised by patent owners. This record indi- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 175, 187]\n\u00a0\n cates the possible extent of a power to direct and censor the ultimate use of the multitudinous patented articles with which the nation's daily life is concerned.\n This record shows that the General Electric Company system, the Radio Corporation system, and the American Telephone & Telegraph Company system are participants in a 'patent pool.' This 'patent pool' controls respondents' patents. The record discloses that this 'patent pool' operates under cross licensing agreements, in the United States and in foreign countries. It appears that the General Electric Company and the Radio Corporation have 'agreed that the Radio Corporation shall not resell patented articles except as a part of the radio system,' and that the Radio Corporation 'agrees to use care not to enter with any patent device, process or system into the field of the General Electric Company or to encourage or aid others to do so.' Throughout the entire agreement appears the manifest purpose of the 'patent pool' participants to protect for each other certain allocated 'fields' in the production, sale and distribution of modern electrical necessities used in everything involving modern communications. Although the patent laws contemplate and authorize but one patent monopoly for one invention, many separate patents authorizing single patent monopolies are merged in this 'patent pool.' Thus, all these separate patent monopolies are combined and in many respects are made to function as one. The record shows that from this larger combination- completely outside the conception in the patent statutes of single and separate monopolies-allotments of submonopolies are made in the respective 'fields,' from which emanate in turn other submonopolies. This Court has previously directed attention to the tendency of such combinations to stimulate patent law abuses, in the following language: 'It was not until the time came in which the full possibilities seem first to have been appreciated of uniting, in one, many branches of business through corporate organiza- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 175, 188]\n\u00a0\n tion, and of gathering great profits in small payments, which are not realized or resented, from many, rather than smaller or even equal profits in larger payments, which are felt and may be refused, from a few, that it came to be thought that the 'right to use ... the invention' of a patent gave to the patentee or his assigns the right to restrict the use of it to materials or supplies not described in the patent, and not by its terms made a part of the thing patented.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Articles manufactured under the patents thus controlled are widely used in the modern electrical field. The exclusive privilege to exercise the unrestrained power to determine the ultimate uses of all these important merchantable articles sold in the open market is a power I do not believe Congress has conferred. A power so far reaching-apart from contract-has not been expressly granted in any statute, and should not be read into the law by implication.\n Second. The numerous patents acquired by respondents all relate to claimed inventions made between 1912 and 1916; yet, some of these patents do not expire until 1940. Patent No. 1448550 illustrates most of the patents involved. It is designated as the 'continuation' of two \n\n[304 \nU.S. 175, 189]\n\u00a0\n earlier applications filed September 3, 1915 and November 2, 1915. February 3, 1919-more than four years after respondents' commercial use- the 'continuation' application was filed and March 13, 1923, the patent was granted. By this process of 'divisionals' or 'continuations' a seventeen-year patent monopoly is permitted to begin in 1923, theoretically based on original applications which were filed in 1915.\n Congress has provided that two years' public use of an invention prior to application bars the right to patent7 and no patent rights are awarded for disclosures in an application which are not claimed. \n8\n Here, however, approval is given patents for inventions-as the District Court found and the record shows-publicly used for more than two years before applications actually claiming the invention were filed. This approval is based on the fact that disclosures (unclaimed) were made in prior and separate applications which had not been preceded by two years' public use. 'Divisional' or 'continuation' applications-unauthorized by any statute- are permitted to give priority from the date of original applications, in effect barring all other inventions from that date and nullifying the statute of two years' public use. Thus for years respondents obtained no patent on their inventions for lack of claim. No one else could safely obtain a patent because of the certainty that respondents would later claim under a 'divisional' or 'continuation.'\n The statute provides no exception of public use by the inventor and, if he uses his completed invention in the ordinary conduct of his business- for more than two \n\n[304 \nU.S. 175, 190]\n\u00a0\n years prior to his application-the discovery is abandoned to the public and he cannot thereafter obtain a patent. \n9\n Such an exception-grafted onto the statute-would be directly contrary to its aim and purpose, and would enable inventors to obtain all the benefits of monopoly by simply making unclaimed disclosures, blanketing the field, and waiting until someone else attempted to claim a patent on the same invention. Then, by means of 'divisional' or 'continuation' applications, patent could be obtained. No such expansion of the patent statutes is justified. \n10\n I believe the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing granted \n304 \nU.S. 587\n, 58 S.Ct. 1051, 82 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The patented device here is an amplifying tube, and the opinion of the District Judge stated: 'The amplifying devices required tubes which the defendant procured in the open market by purchase from authorized distributors; each tube carton bore a license notice reading as follows:\n\"License Notice.\n\n\"In connection with devices it sells, Radio Corporation of America has rights under patents having claims (a) on the devices themselves and ( b) on combination of the devices with other devices or elements, as for example in various circuits and hook-ups.\" \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Motion Picture Co. v.

Clark, of New York City, for respondents. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 124, 125]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case, we affirmed on May 2, 1938 (\n304 \nU.S. 175\n, 58 S.Ct. 849), the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals (2 Cir., 91 F. 2d 922), which held that petitioner had infringed certain patents relating to vacuum tube amplifiers. On May 31st, we granted a rehearing (\n304 \nU.S. 587\n, 58 S.Ct. 1051), upon the following questions which had been presented by the petition for certiorari.\n\n 1. \nCan the owner of a patent, by means thereof, restrict the use made of a device manufactured under the patent, after the device has passed into the hands of a purchaser in the ordinary channels of trade, and full consideration paid therefor?\n\n 2. \nCan a patent owner, merely by a 'license notice' attached to a device made under the patent, and sold in the ordinary channels of trade, place an enforceable restriction on the purchaser thereof as to the use to which the purchaser may put the device?\n Upon further hearing we are of opinion that neither question should be answered. For we find that, while the devices embody the inventions of the patents in suit, they were not manufactured or sold 'under the patent( s)' and did not 'pass into the hands of a purchaser in the ordinary channels of trade.'\n These are the relevant facts. Amplifiers embodying the invention here involved are useful in several distinct fields. Among these is (a) the commercial field of sound recording and reproducing, which embraces talking picture equipment for theatres, and (b) the private or home field, which embraces radio broadcast reception, radio amateur reception and radio experimental reception. For the commercial field exclusive licenses had been granted by the patent pool to Western Electric \n\n[305 \nU.S. 124, 126]\n\u00a0\n Company and Electrical Research Products, Inc. For the private or home field the patent pool granted non-exclusive licenses to about fifty manufacturers. Among these was American Transformer Company. It was licensed 'solely and only to the extent and for the uses hereinafter specified and defined ... to manufacture ..., and to sell ... only for radio amateur reception, radio experimental reception and radio broadcast reception ... licensed apparatus so manufactured by the Licensee. ...'\n The license provided further: 'Nothing herein contained shall be regarded as conferring upon the Licensee either expressly or by estoppel, implication or otherwise, a license to manufacture or sell, any apparatus except such as may be manufactured by the Licensee in accordance with the express provision of this Agreement.'\n Transformer Company, knowing that it had not been licensed to manufacture or to sell amplifiers for use in theatres as part of talking picture equipment, made for that commercial use the amplifiers in controversy and sold them to Pictures Corporation for that commercial use. Pictures Corporation ordered the amplifiers and purchased them knowing that Transformer Company had not been licensed to make or sell them for such use in theatres. Any use beyond the valid terms of a license is, of course, an infringement of a patent. Robinson on Patents,  916. If where a patented invention is applicable to different uses, the owner of the patent may legally restrict a licensee to a particular field and exclude him from others, Transformer Company was guilty of an infringement when it made the amplifiers for, and sold them to, Pictures Corporation. And as Pictures Corporation ordered, purchased and leased them knowing the facts, it also was an infringer. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 124, 127]\n\u00a0\n The question of law requiring decision is whether the restriction in the license is to be given effect. That a restrictive license is legal seems clear. Mitchell v. Hawley, 16 Wall. 544. As was said in United States v. General Electric Co., \n272 \nU.S. 476, 489\n, 47 S.Ct. 192, 196, the patentee may grant a license 'upon any condition the performance of which is reasonably within the reward which the patentee by the grant of the patent is entitled to secure.' The restriction here imposed is of that character. The practice of granting licenses for a restricted use is an old one, see Providence Rubber Company v. Goodyear, 9 Wall. 788, 799, 800; Gamewall Fire-Alarm Telegraph Co. v. Brooklyn, C.C., 14 F. 255. So far as appears, its legality has never been questioned. The parties stipulated that 'it is common practice where a patented invention is applicable to different uses, to grant written licenses to manufacture under United States Letters Patents restricted to one or more of the several fields of use permitting the exclusive or non-exclusive use of the invention by the licensee in one field and excluding it in another field.'\n As the restriction was legal and the amplifiers were made and sold outside the scope of the license, the effect is precisely the same as if no license whatsoever had been granted to Transformer Company. And as Pictures Corporation knew the facts, it is in no better position than if it had manufactured the amplifiers itself without a license. It is liable because it has used the invention without license to do so.\n We have consequently no occasion to consider what the rights of the parties would have been if the amplifier had been manufactured 'under the patent' and 'had passed into the hands of a purchaser in the ordinary channels of trade.' Nor have we occasion to consider the effect of a 'licensee's notice' which purports to restrict the use of articles lawfully sold.\n Affirmed. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 124, 128]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n Almost a century ago, this Court asserted, and time after time thereafter it has reasserted, that when an article described in a patent is sold and 'passes to the hands of a purchaser, it is no longer within the limits of the monopoly. It passes outside of it, and is no longer under the protection of the act of Congress. ... Contracts in relation to it are regulated by the laws of the State, and are subject to State jurisdiction.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 124, 129]\n\u00a0\n A single departure from this judicial interpretation of the patent statute2 was expressly overruled within five years, and this Court again reasserted that commodities-once sold-were not thereafter 'subject to conditions as to use' imposed by patent owners. \n3\n In result, the judgment here is a second departure from the traditional judicial interpretation of the patent laws.\n As a consequence of the return to the interpretation of the patent statutes previously repudiated and expressly overruled, petitioner is enjoined from making full use of, and must account in triple damages for using, \n\n[305 \nU.S. 124, 130]\n\u00a0\n tubes and amplifiers which he owns. He became the owner of the tubes by purchase from various retailers authorized by respondents to sell in the open market. He became the owner of the amplifiers by purchase from a manufacturer who-having the complete right to make them-had contracted to sell only for limited uses. 4 The departure here permits the patentee-by virtue of his contract with the manufacturer-to restrict the uses to which this purchaser and owner may put his tubes and amplifiers.\n Transformer Company was authorized by the patentee to make and to sell amplifiers. It did make such amplifiers-of a standard type usable in may fields,5 they \n\n[305 \nU.S. 124, 131]\n\u00a0\n became its property when made, were sold to and became the property of petitioner. The prior opinion in this case, both courts below and the opinion on this rehearing, all refer to the transaction between Transformer Company and petitioner as a sale. Even the very contract authorizing the Transformer Company to make and sell the amplifiers provided 'That for the purpose of this agreement all Licensed Apparatus shall be considered as 'sold' when the Licensed Apparatus has been billed out, or if not billed out, when it has been delivered, shipped, or mailed.'\n Notice to the purchaser in any form could not-under the patent law- limit or restrict the use of the amplifiers after they were sold6 and knowledge by both vendor and purchaser that the articles were purchased for use outside the 'field' for which the vendor had been given the right to sell, made the transaction between them no less a sale. \n7\n Had petitioner- after making the purchase-decided not to use these amplifiers in the forbidden fields, or had they been destroyed prior to such use, certainly the mere state of mind of the parties at the time of sale would not have made them both infringers.\n Indeed, petitioner could use the amplifiers at all only in combination with tubes which it purchased on the open market from retailers authorized by respondents to sell. Therefore, even if the state of mind of vendor and purchaser were material, Transformer Company could \n\n[305 \nU.S. 124, 132]\n\u00a0\n be considered an infringer only because it sold a commodity which might- depending on possible events after the sale-be used in infringing combination with another lawfully purchased commodity. The patent law was not intended to accomplish such result. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioner has persistently contended throughout this litigation that no existing trade practice permits a patentee-under guise of a 'license'- to extend his monopoly to commodities after sale, and has not stipulated otherwise. \n9\n Neither stipulation nor practice could justify \n\n[305 \nU.S. 124, 133]\n\u00a0\n extension of patent monopoly beyond the limits of legality fixed by Congress and recognized by this Court for over three-quarters of a century. 'The statutory authority to grant the exclusive right to 'use' a patented machine ... is precisely the same, as the authority to grant the exclusive right to 'vend' ....'10 A widespread practice of restricting the resale price of articles described in patents11 did not prevent this Court from holding that once the statutory right to vend has been exercised 'the added restriction is beyond the protection and purpose of the act.' \n12\n Similarly, a 'common practice ... to grant written licenses ... restricted to one or more ... fields of ... use' cannot prevent the application of 'that line of cases in which this court has from the beginning held that a patentee who has parted with a patented machine by passing title to a purchaser has placed the article beyond the limits of the monopoly secured by the patent act.' \n13\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED joins in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Bloomer v.

The rule asserted in these cases is in accord with the views of Thomas Jefferson who served as a member of the first Patent Board established by the first Patent Act of 1790 (1 Stat. 109) and who also drafted the comprehensive Patent Law of 1793 (1 Stat. 318). See, 'The Jeffersonian Cyclopedia', p. 680 (Funk and Wagnalls, 1900). The Acts of 1790 and 1793 granted patentees for fourteen years the exclusive right 'of making, constructing, using and vending to others to be used.' Section 1. Mr. Jefferson, referring to the general rules adopted by the first Patent Board, said: 'One of those (rules) was that a machine of which we were possessed might be applied by every man to any use of which it is susceptible and that this right ought not to be taken from him and given to a monopolist, because the first perhaps had occasion so to apply it. Thus a screw for crushing plaster might be employed for crushing corn-cobs. And a chain pump for raising water might be used for raising wheat: this being merely a change of application.' 'The Writings of Thomas Jefferson', Vol. VI, H. A. Washington, Editor, p. 181 (Published by Order of the Joint Committee of Congress on the Library, 1861). After the Patent Board's duties devolved upon the courts, Mr. Jefferson suggested that the rule be 'adopted by the judges' that 'the purchaser of the right to use the invention should be free to apply it to every purpose of which it is susceptible.' Id., p. 372. (Italics supplied.)\n United States v. General Electric Co., \n272 \nU.S. 476\n, 47 S.Ct. 192, relied on by the majority here, was not a suit for infringement of a patent, but was an action by the United States under the anti-trust laws. The opinion was written by Chief Justice Taft and applied some of the reasoning of the Button Fastener Case, Heaton-Pennisular Button- Fastener Co. v. Eureka Specialty Co., 6 Cir., 77 F. 288, 35 L.R.A. 728, in which he had agreed as Circuit Judge to the opinion of Circuit Judge Lurton. \n Later, this Court in Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., \n224 \nU.S. 1\n, 32 S.Ct. 364, Ann.Cas.1913D, 880, with the then Justice Lurton writing the opinion, followed the Button Fastener Case. Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., supra, expressly overruled and repudiated the doctrine of the Dick Case. In effect, the judgment here once more revives the doctrine of the Button Fastener Case.\n The majority opinion also relies upon Mitchell v. Hawley, supra. It is significant that in the Hawley Case the patentee never licensed or transferred his exclusive right to sell; and the license conveyed only 'the exclusive right to make and use 'and to license to others the right to use ....\" 16 Wall. at page 548. That case, therefore, does not justify the judgment here where the patentee's power to vend was both transferred and exercised. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Henry v. A. B.

Similarly, the exercise of the right to vend exhausts the right under a patent to control the price at which an article claimed in the patent may subsequently be sold. Bauer v. O'Donnell, supra; Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co. supra; Boston Store v. American Graphophone Co., supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] License Agreement. '... That Whereas the Licensors represent that they severally own and\/or have the right to grant licenses under various United States Letters Patent relating to Power Supply and to Power Amplifier Units, hereinafter termed Licensed Apparatus, ...\n'1. Each of the Licensors hereby grants under all of the United States Patent useful in the Licensed Apparatus, owned by it and\/or with respect to which it has the right to grant licenses, ... solely and only to the extent and for the uses hereinafter specified and defined, a personal, indivisible, nontransferable and non-exclusive license to the Licensee, to manufacture at its factory ...; and not elsewhere without previous written permission obtained from the Radio Corporation, and to sell only for radio amateur reception, radio experimental reception, and radio broadcast reception throughout the United States and its territories or dependencies, Licensed Apparatus so manufactured by the Licensee, ...' (Italics supplied.) Reasonably interpreted, this contract grants the right to make everything described in the patents; the sole limitation on the right to make relates to the place of manufacture. The contract grants the right to sell the manufactured articles with an attempt by notice to restrict their use in the hands of owners to whom they are sold. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] One of respondents' officials testified: 'These things, these vacuum tubes and are useful in various of these fields and applicable to many fields. And if we granted licenses not restricted to any particular field, the same things could be used in these other fields.' The injunction sustained here was decreed by the District Judge on the basis of his conclusion that the amplifiers put to commercial use by petitioner could also be used 'for experimental or radio amateur use' as the patentee had desired. D.C., 16 F.Supp. 293, 303. Thus, it appears that the very amplifiers made and sold to petitioner were suitable for all 'fields.' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 'The statutes relating to patents do not provide for any such notice and it can derive no aid from them.'

The complaint set forth two causes of action but at the trial plaintiff elected to stand upon the second cause of action which was based upon the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.  51-59, 45 U.S.C.A.  51-59. Defendants' motion for the direction of a verdict in their favor was denied and the jury found for the plaintiff. The Supreme Court of the State affirmed the judgment. 105 Mont. 302, 72 P.2d 1007\n\n\n After ruling that upon the evidence the question of plaintiff's assumption of risk was one of the jury, the court stated as a further ground for affirming the judgment that the defense of assumption of risk was not available under the federal statute. The court pointed to the provision (sec. 54) that an employee of the common carrier shall not be held to have assumed the risks of his employment 'in any case where the violation by such common carrier of any statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury or death of such employee'. The court ruled that the Federal Employers' Liability Act was one intended to promote the safety of employees and hence that the defense of assumption of risk was barred.\n This ruling was error. The provision of Section 54 relates to such statutes as the Safety Appliance Acts (March 2, 1893, c. 196, 27 Stat. 531, 45 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.; March 2, 1903, c. 976, 32 Stat. 943, 45 U.S.C.A.  8 et seq.; April 14, 1910, c. 160, 36 Stat. 298, 45 U.S.C.A.  11 et seq.; February 17, 1911, c. 103, 36 Stat. 913, 45 U.S.C.A.  22 et seq.); the Hours of Service Act (March 4, 1907, c. 2939, 34 Stat. 1415, 45 U.S.C.A.  61-64); and other statutes subjecting carriers in interstate commerce to particular obligations for the safety of their employees.

It is not contended that the instructions of the trial court upon that defense were erroneous. The contention is that there was no evidence to go to the jury. We think that there was.\n The judgment is affirmed with respect to the petitioner Great Northern Railway Company. As to the petitioner George Pappas, the writ of certiorari is dismissed upon the ground that the federal question as to the right of recovery under the Act against him individually, as distinguished from the Railway Company, was not properly presented. It is so ordered.\n Judgment affirmed in part and certiorari dismissed in part.\n Mr. Justice BLACK is of the opinion that the writ of certiorari should be dismissed as to both petitioners. \n\n\n\n","48":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGUARANTY TRUST CO. OF NEW YORK v. COM. OF VIRGINIA(1938)\n\nArgued: Decided: November 7, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 19, 20]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James R. Caskie, of Lynchburg, Va., for petitioner.\n Mr. Abram P. Staples, of Richmond, Va., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Mrs. Mary T. Ryan, while resident and citizen of Virginia in 1930, 1931 and 1932, was beneficiary of a trust set up under the will of her husband, Thomas F. Ryan, who died when a citizen of New York, in 1928. The will was probated in New York; the trustees qualified there, took over the assets and have kept them there. The trust has been administered and accounts settled under the laws of that state.\n The will divided the estate into fifty-four parts and directed payment of the income therefrom to designated beneficiaries. These are the provisions presently important-\n Twelve (12) of said equal parts to said Trustees in trust to receive the income therefrom, and to pay over such part of said income to my dear wife, Mary T. Ryan, as they in their sole discretion may determine to be necessary and proper for her care, support and comfort during her life, in such installments and at such intervals as they in their sole discretion may determine. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 19, 21]\n\u00a0\n The will further provided that the trustees should 'divide any surplus income from said twelve parts not paid to my wife as aforesaid, into forty-two equal portions, and to pay such surplus income in equal quarterly payments as near as may be' to certain distributees as designated in said will, and that upon the death of the said wife the principal amount of the said twelve equal parts should be divided and distributed to certain designated distributees, as set out in said will.\n The New York and Virginia statutes* laying taxes upon incomes from trusts are substantially alike. They require trustees to report income received and where the trust is discretionary to pay the amount assessed upon the entire income; if the trust is an ordinary one each beneficiary is assessed upon the amount received by him.\n For 1930, 1931 and 1932 New York in one or both of these ways received taxes upon the entire income of the trust set up under the will. Exercising their discretion, after satisfying the taxes, the trustees paid to Mrs. Ryan considerable sums out of the income, from twelve fifty- fourths of the estate-in all approximately $300,000. For the same years Virginia assessed ordinary state income taxes against her on account of the sums so received. They were paid and this proceeding was begun in the circuit court of Nelson County to recover them. It sustained the tax and the highest court of the state affirmed the judgment. The matter comes here by certiorari granted upon the following statement-\n This petition presents the issue as to whether the State of Virginia has the right, under the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, U.S.C.A. Const. Amend. 14, to assess an income tax on income received by the said Mary T. Ryan for the years in question, when the identical income in the hands of her Trustees had been assessed with income taxes by the State of New York, and which said taxes had \n\n[305 \nU.S. 19, 22]\n\u00a0\n been paid there, thus imposing two State taxes on the same income.\n Counsel for petitioner submits-\n The same income was subjected to taxation by two states. New York unquestionably had the right to exact the tax upon the income of the trust, and thereby Virginia was inhibited. The provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A. Const. Amend. 14, protect against such taxation by two states on the same income. Here, both the Equal Protection and the Due Process clauses forbid the challenged exactment.\n The claim that equal protection has been denied seems to rest upon an assumed literal construction of the Virginia statute which would require income from discretionary trusts to be taxed against both trustee and beneficiary, while only one tax (against the beneficiary) would fall upon income from ordinary trusts.\n We must, of course, deal with rights here actually involved. The state has made one assessment against a resident beneficiary because of income received within her jurisdiction and her courts have approved. They have not interpreted her statutes according to the petitioner's assumption.\n The right to recognize a distinction between ordinary and discretionary trusts and thus insure collection of taxes upon the entire income actually received from the latter seems clear enough.\n Has there been denial of Due Process-\n The insistence is that the challenged assessment was upon the identical income already rightly taxed by New York; that under numerous decisions by us two or more states may not tax the same subject; this would amount to double taxation and infringe the Due Process clause. To support this proposition the cases noted in the margin1 are cited. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 19, 23]\n\u00a0\n Those cases go upon the theory that the taxing power of a state is restricted to her confines and may not be exercised in respect of subjects beyond them. Here, the thing taxed was receipt of income within Virginia by a citizen residing there. The mere fact that another state lawfully taxed funds from which the payments were made did not necessarily destroy Virginia's right to tax something done within her borders. After much discussion the applicable doctrine was expounded and applied in Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276\n, 52 S.Ct. 556, 87 A.L.R. 374, and New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, \n300 \nU.S. 308\n, 57 S.Ct. 466. The attempt to draw a controlling distinction between them and the present cause, we think has not been successful.\n The challenged judgment must be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Tax Law N.Y.  365, Consol.Laws N.Y. c. 60; Tax Code Va.  50, Code 1936, Appendix, p. 2410. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v.

Gen., for the United States. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 126, 129]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The principal questions for decision are whether, in a suit at law brought in a federal District Court to recover the deposit of a foreign government with a New York bank, such government is subject to the local statute of limitations as are private litigants; and, if so, whether the assignment of November 16, 1933, by the Russian Soviet Government to the United States of the right of the former to the bank account restricts or overrides the operation of the statute of limitations. A subsidiary question is whether in the circumstances of the case the running of the statute of limitations, if otherwise applicable, was affected by our nonrecognition of the Soviet Government during the interval of approximately 16 years between recognition of the Provisional Government of Russia and recognition of its successor.\n On July 15, 1916, the Imperial Russian Government opened a bank account with petitioner, the Guaranty Trust Company, a New York banking corporation. On March 16, 1917, the Imperial Government was overthrown and was succeeded by the Provisional Government of Russia which was recognized by the United States on March 22, 1917. On July 5, 1917, Mr. Boris Bakhmeteff was officially recognized by the President as the Ambassador of Russia. On July 12, 1917, the account being overdrawn, $5,000,000 was deposited in the account by Mr. Serge Ughet, Financial Attache of the Russian Embassy in the United States. On Nobember 7, 1917, the Provisional Government was overthrown and was succeeded by the government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which will be referred to as the Soviet Government. At that time there remained on deposit in the account the sum of approximately $5,000,000. On November 28, 1917, the Soviet Government dismissed Bakhmeteff as Ambassador and Ughet as Financial At- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 126, 130]\n\u00a0\n tache . But the United States continued to recognize Bakhmeteff as Ambassador until on June 30, 1922, he withdrew from his representation of the Russian Government. Thereafter, until November 16, 1933, it continued to recognize the Financial Attache , and after the retirement of Bakhmeteff as Ambassador it recognized the former as custodian of Russian property in the United States.\n On November 16, 1933, the United States recognized the Soviet Government, and on that date took from it an assignment of all 'amounts admitted to be due that may be found to be due it, as the successor of prior Governments of Russia, or otherwise, from American nationals, including corporations. ...' After making demand upon the petitioner for payment of the balance of the account the United States, on September 21, 1934, brought the present suit in the District Court for Southern New York to recover the deposit. Petitioner then moved under the Conformity Act, 28 U.S.C.  724, 28 U.S.C.A.  724; New York Civil Practice Act,  307; and Rules 107 and 120 of the New York Rules of Civil Practice, to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the recovery was barred by the New York 6- year statute of limitations.\n In support of the motion petitioner submitted numerous affidavits, two depositions, and other documentary proof tending to show that on February 25, 1918, it had applied the balance of the account as a credit against indebtedness alleged to be due to it by the Russian Government by reason of the latter's seizure of certain ruble deposit accounts of petitioner in Russian private banks; that on that date it had repudiated all liability on the deposit account; and that it had then given notice of such repudiation to the Financial Attache of the Russian Embassy and later both to the Financial Attache and to Bakhmeteff as Ambassador. The United States sumbitted affidavits and exhibits in opposition. The District Court \n\n[304 \nU.S. 126, 131]\n\u00a0\n found that petitioner had repudiated liability on the account on February 25, 1918; that it had given due notice of repudiation prior to June 30, 1922, to both the Financial Attache and Ambassador Bakhmeteff; and that recovery was barred by the applicable 6-year statute of limitations of New York. New York Civil Practice Act,  48. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the judgment for petitioner, holding that the New York statute of limitations does not run against a foreign sovereign. 2 Cir., 91 F.2d 898. Moved by the importance of the questions involved, we granted certiorari. \n302 \nU.S. 681\n, 58 S.Ct. 363, 82 L.Ed. --.\n Respondent argues that the Soviet Government, in a suit brought in the federal courts, is not subject to the local statute of limitations both because a foreign, like a domestic sovereign, is not subject to statutes of limitations, and its immunity as in the case of a domestic sovereign constitutes an implied exception to that statute and to the Conformity Act; and because in any case, since no suit to recover the deposit could have been maintained in New York by the Soviet Government prior to its recognition by the United States and, since according to New York law the statute does not run during the period when suit cannot be brought, the present suit is not barred. It is insisted further that even though the Soviet Government is bound by the local statute of limitations the United States is not so bound, both because the New York statute which bars the remedy but does not extinguish the right is not applicable to the United States, and because the statute is inoperative and ineffective since it conflicts with and impedes the execution of the executive agreement between the Soviet Government and the United States by which the assignment was effected. Finally, the government assails the finding of fact of the District Court that petitioner repudiated the liability upon the deposit account, and contends that notice of the repudiation given by petitioner to representa- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 126, 132]\n\u00a0\n tives of the Provisional Government was ineffective to set the statute running against the Soviet Government and in favor of petitioner.\n First. The rule quod nullum tempus occurrit regi-that the sovereign is exempt from the consequences of its laches, and from the operation of statutes of limitations-appears to be a vestigial survival of the prerogative of the Crown. See Magdalen College Case, 11 Co.Rep.66b, 74b; Hobart, L.C.J. in Sir Edward Coke's Case, Gobd. 289, 295; Bracton, De Legibus, Lib. ii, c. 5,  7. But whether or not that alone accounts for its origin, the source of its continuing vitality where the royal privilege no longer exists is to be found in the public policy now underlying the rule even though it may in the beginning have had a different policy basis. Compare Maine, Ancient Law, 10th Ed., 1930, 32 et seq. 'The true reason ... is to be found in the great public policy of preserving the public rights, revenues, and property from injury and loss, by the negligence of public officers. And though this is sometimes called a prerogative right, it is in fact nothing more than a reservation, or exception, introduced for the public benefit, and equally applicable to all governments.' Story, J., in United States v. Hoar, 26 Fed.Cas. p. 329, 330, No. 15373. Regardless of the form of government and independently of the royal prerogative once thought sufficient to justify it, the rule is supportable now because its benefit and advantage extend to every citizen, including the defendant, whose plea of laches or limitation it precludes; and its uniform survival in the United States has been generally accounted for and justified on grounds of policy rather than upon any inherited notions of the personal privilege of the king. United States v. Kirkpatrick, 9 Wheat. 720, 735; United States v. Knight, 14 Pet. 301, 315; United States v. Thompson, \n98 \nU.S. 486\n, 489; Fink v. O'Neil, \n106 \nU.S. 272, 281\n, 1 S.Ct. 325; United States v. Nashville, C. & St. L. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 126, 133]\n\u00a0\n R. Co., \n118 \nU.S. 120, 125\n, 6 S.Ct. 1006. So complete has been its acceptance that the implied immunity of the domestic 'sovereign,' state or national, has been universally deemed to be an exception to local statutes of limitations where the government, state or national, is not expressly included; and to the Conformity Act. See United States v. Thompson, supra.\n Whether the benefit of the rule should be extended to a foreign sovereign suing in a state or federal court is a question to which no conclusive answer is to be found in the authorities. Diligent search of counsel has revealed no judicial decision supporting such an application of the rule in this or any other country. The alleged immunity was doubted in French Republic v. Saratoga Vichy Spring Co., \n191 \nU.S. 427, 437\n, 24 S. Ct. 145, and in Commissioners of Sinking Fund of Louisville v. Buckner, C.C., 48 F. 533. It was rejected in Western Lunatic Asylum v. Miller, 29 W.Va. 326, 329, 1 S.E. 740, 6 Am.St.Rep. 644, and was disregarded in Royal Italian Government v. International Committee of Y.M. C.A., 273 N.Y. 468, 6 N.E.2d 407, where neither appellate court delivered an opinion.\n The only support found by the court below for a different conclusion is a remark in the opinion of the court in United States v. Nashville, C. & St. L.R. Co., supra, where its holding that the United States, suing in a federal court, is not subject to the local statute of limitations, was said to rest upon a great principle of public policy 'applicable to all governments alike.' The statement is but a paraphrase, which has frequently appeared in judicial opinion,1 of Mr. Justice Story's statement in United States v. Hoar, supra, already quoted. His reference to the public policy supporting the rule that limitation does not run against a domestic sovereign as 'equally appli- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 126, 134]\n\u00a0\n cable to all governments' was obviously designed to point out that the policy is as applicable to our own as to a monarchical form of government, and is therefore not to be discarded because of its former identity with the royal prerogative. We can find in that pronouncement and in its later versions no intimation that the policy underlying exemption of the domestic sovereign supports its extension to a foreign sovereign suing in our courts.\n It is true that upon the principle of comity foreign sovereigns and their public property are held not to be amenable to suit in our courts without their consent. See The Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116; Berizzi Bros. Co. v. S.S. Pesaro, \n271 \nU.S. 562\n, 46 S.Ct. 611; The Navemar, \n303 \nU.S. 68\n, 58 S.Ct. 432, decided January 31, 1938. But very different considerations apply where the foreign sovereign avails itself of the privilege, likewise extended by comity, of suing in our courts. See The Sapphire, 11 Wall. 164, 167; Russian S.F.S. Republic v. Cibrario, 235 N.Y. 255, 139 N.E. 259. By voluntarily appearing in the role of suitor it abandons its immunity from suit and subjects itself to the procedure and rules of decision governing the forum which it has sought. Even the domestic sovereign by joining in suit accepts whatever liabilities the court may decide to be a reasonable incident of that act. United States v. The Thekla, \n266 \nU.S. 328, 340\n, 341 S., 45 S.Ct. 112, 113; United States v. Stinson, \n197 \nU.S. 200, 205\n, 25 S.Ct. 426; The Davis, 10 Wall. 15; The Siren, 7 Wall. 152, 159.2 As in the case of the domestic sovereign \n\n[304 \nU.S. 126, 135]\n\u00a0\n in like situation, those rules, which must be assumed to be founded on principles of justice applicable to individuals, are to be relaxed only in response to some persuasive demand of public policy generated by the nature of the suitor or of the claim which it asserts. That this is the guiding principle sufficiently appears in the many instances in which courts have narrowly restricted the application of the rule nullum tempus in the case of the domestic sovereign. \n3\n It likewise appears from those cases which justify the rule as applied to the United States suing in a state court, on the ground that it is sovereign within the state and that invocation of the rule nullum tempus protects the public interest there as well as in every other state. United States v. Beebe, \n127 \nU.S. 338\n, 8 S.Ct. 1083; Booth v. United States, 11 Gill & J., Md., 373; McNamee v. United States, 11 Ark. 148; cf. United States v. People of State of California, \n297 \nU.S. 175, 186\n, 56 S.Ct. 421, 425.\n We are unable to discern in the case where a foreign sovereign, by suit, seeks justice according to the law of the forum, any of the considerations of public policy \n\n[304 \nU.S. 126, 136]\n\u00a0\n which support the application of the rule nullum tempus to a domestic sovereign. The statute of limitations is a statute of repose, designed to protect the citizens from stale and vexatious claims, and to make an end to the possibility of litigation after the lapse of a reasonable time. It has long been regarded by this Court and by the courts of New York as a meritorious defense, in itself serving a public interest. Bell v. Morrison, 1 Pet. 351, 360; M'Cluny v. Silliman, 3 Pet. 270, 278; Campbell v. Haverhill, \n155 \nU.S. 610, 617\n, 15 S.Ct. 217; United States v. Oregon Lumber Co., \n260 \nU.S. 290\n, 43 S.Ct. 100; Brooklyn Bank v. Barnaby, 197 N.Y. 210, 227, 90 N.E. 834, 27 L.R.A.,N. S., 843; Schmidt v. Merchants Despatch Transportation Co., 270 N.Y. 287, 302, 200 N.E. 824, 104 A.L.R. 450. Denial of its protection against the demand of the domestic sovereign in the interest of the domestic community of which the debtor is a part could hardly be thought to argue for a like surrender of the local interest in favor of a foreign sovereign and the community which it represents. We cannot say that the public interest of the forum goes so far.\n We lay aside questions not presented here which might arise if the national government, in the conduct of its foreign affairs, be treaty or other appropriate action, should undertake to restrict the application of local statutes of limitations against foreign governments, or if the states in enacting them should discriminate against suits brought by a foreign government. We decide only that in the absence of such action the limitation statutes of the forum run against a foreign government seeking a remedy afforded by the forum, as they run against private litigants.\n Second. Respondent, relying on the New York rules that the statute of limitations does not run against a suit to recover a bank account until liability upon it is repudiated, Tillman v. Guaranty Trust Co., 253 N.Y. 295, 171 N.E. 61, and that the statute of limitations \n\n[304 \nU.S. 126, 137]\n\u00a0\n does not run against a plaintiff who has no forum in which to assert his rights, Oswego & Syracuse R. Co. v. State, 226 N.Y. 351, 359, 362, 124 N.E. 8; Board of Sup'rs of Cayuga County v. State, 153 N.Y. 279, 291, 47 N.E. 288; Parmenter v. State, 135 N.Y. 154, 163, 31 N.E. 1035, argues that until recognition of the Soviet Government there was no person to whom notice of petitioner's repudiation could be given and no court in which suit could be maintained to recover the deposit.\n It is not denied that, in conformity to generally accepted principles, the Soviet Government could not maintain a suit in our courts before its recognition by the political department of the government. For this reason access to the federal and state courts was denied to the Soviet Government before recognition. The Penza, D.C., 277 F. 91; The Rogdai, D.C., 278 F. 294; Russian Socialist F. S. Republic v. Cibrario, supra; Preobazhenski v. Cibrario, Sup., 192 N.Y.S. 275. But the argument ignores the principle controlling here and recognized by the courts of New York that the rights of a sovereign state are vested in the state rather than in any particular government which may purport to represent it, The Sapphire, supra, 11 Wall. 164, 168, and that suit in its behalf may be maintained in our courts only by that government which has been recognized by the political department of our own government as the authorized government of the foreign state. Jones v. United States, \n137 \nU.S. 202, 212\n, 11 S.Ct. 80; Russian Government v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., D.C., 293 F. 133, 135, aff'd sub nom. Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. State of Russia, 2 Cir., 21 F. 2d 396, 409; Matter of Lehigh Valley R. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 573\n, 44 S.Ct. 460; Russian S.F.S.R. v. Cibrario, supra; Moore, International Law Digest,  75, 78.\n What government is to be regarded here as representative of a foreign sovereign state is a political rather than a judicial question, and is to be determined by the political department of the government. Objections to its deter- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 126, 138]\n\u00a0\n mination as well as to the underlying policy are to be addressed to it and not to the courts. Its action in recognizing a foreign government and in receiving its diplomatic representatives is conclusive on all domestic courts, which are bound to accept that determination, although they are free to draw for themselves its legal consequences in litigations pending before them. Jones v. United States, supra, \n137 \nU.S. 202, 212\n, 11 S.Ct. 80; Agency of Canadian Car & Foundry Co. v. American Can Co., 2 Cir., 258 F. 363, 6 A.L.R. 1182; Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. State of Russia, supra.\n We accept as conclusive here the determination of our own State Department that the Russian State was represented by the Provisional Government through its duly recognized representatives from March 16, 1917, to November 16, 1933, when the Soviet Government was recognized. \n4\n There was at all times during that period a recog- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 126, 139]\n\u00a0\n nized diplomatic representative of the Russian State to whom notice concerning its interests within the United States could be communicated, and to whom our courts were open for the purpose of prosecuting suits in behalf of the Russian State. In fact, during that period suits were brought in its behalf in both the federal and state courts, which consistently ruled that the recognized Ambassador and Financial Attache were authorized to maintain them. \n 5\n\u00a0\n\n We do not stop to inquire what the 'actual authority of those diplomatic representatives may have been. When the question is of the running of the statute of limitations, it is enough that our courts have been open to suit on behalf of the Russian State in whom the right to sue upon the petitioner's present claim was vested, and that the political department of the government has accorded recognition to a government of that state, received its diplomatic representatives, and extended to them the privilege of maintaining suit in our courts in behalf of their state. The right and opportunity to sue upon the claim against petitioner was not suspended; and notice of repudiation of the liability given to the duly recognized diplomatic representatives must so far as our \n\n[304 \nU.S. 126, 140]\n\u00a0\n own courts are concerned, be taken as notice to the state whom they represented.\n The government argues that recognition of the Soviet Government, an action which for many purposes validated here that government's previous acts within its own territory, see Underhill v. Hernandez, \n168 \nU.S. 250\n, 18 S.Ct. 83; Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., \n246 \nU.S. 297\n, 38 S.Ct. 309; Ricaud v. American Metal Co., \n246 \nU.S. 304\n, 38 S. Ct. 312; United States v. Belmont, \n301 \nU.S. 324\n, 57 S.Ct. 758; Dougherty v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc., 266 N.Y. 71, 84, 85, 193 N.E. 897; Luther v. Sagor & Co., (1921) 3 K.B.D. 532, operates to set at naught all the legal consequences of the prior recognition by the United States of the Provisional Government and its representatives, as though such recognition had never been accorded. This is tantamount to saying that the judgments in suits maintained here by the diplomatic representatives of the Provisional Government, valid when rendered, became invalid upon recognition of the Soviet Government. The argument thus ignores the distinction between the effect of our recognition of a foreign government with respect to its acts within its own territory prior to recognition, and the effect upon previous transactions consummated here between its predecessor and our own nationals. The one operates only to validate to a limited extent acts of a de facto government which, by virtue of the recognition, has become a government de jure. But it does not follow that recognition renders of no effect transactions here with a prior recognized government in conformity to the declared policy of our own government. The very purpose of the recognition by our government is that our nationals may be conclusively advised with what government they may safely carry on business transactions and who its representatives are. If those transactions, valid when entered into, were to be disregarded after the later recognition of a successor government, recognition \n\n[304 \nU.S. 126, 141]\n\u00a0\n would be but an idle ceremony, yielding none of the advantages of established diplomatic relations in enabling business transactions to proceed, and affording no protection to our own nationals in carrying them on.\n So far as we are advised no court has sanctioned such a doctrine. The notion that the judgment in suits maintained by the representative of the Provisional Government would not be conclusive upon all successor governments, was considered and rejected in Russian Government v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., supra. An application for writ of prohibition was denied by this Court. Matter of Lehigh Valley R. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 573\n, 44 S.Ct. 460. We conclude that the recognition of the Soviet Government left unaffected those legal consequences of the previous recognition of the Provisional Government and its representatives, which attached to action taken here prior to the later recognition.\n Third. If the claim of the Russian Government was barred by limitation the United States as its assignee can be in no better position either because of the rule nullum tempus or by virtue of the terms of the assignment. We need waste no time on refinements upon the suggested distinction between rights and remedies, for we may assume for present purposes that the United States acquired by the assignment whatever rights then survived the running of the statute against the Russian Government, and that it may assert those rights subject to such plea of limitations as may be made by petitioner.\n As has already been noted, the rule nullum tempus rests on the public policy of protecting the domestic sovereign from omissions of its own officers and agents whose neglect, through lapse of time, would otherwise deprive it of rights. But the circumstances of the present case admit of no appeal to such a policy. There has been no neglect or delay by the United States or its agents, and it has lost no rights by any lapse of time after the assignment. The question is whether the exemption of the United States \n\n[304 \nU.S. 126, 142]\n\u00a0\n from the consequences of the neglect of its own agents is enough to relieve it from the consequences of the Russian Government's failure to prosecute the claim. Proof, under a plea of limitation, that the 6-year statutory period had run before the assignment offends against no policy of protecting the domestic sovereign. It deprives the United States of no right, for the proof demonstrates that the United States never acquired a right free of a pre-existing infirmity, the running of limitations against its assignor, which public policy does not forbid. United States v. Buford, 3 Pet. 12, 30; King v. Morrall, 6 Price 24, 28, 30.\n Assuming that the respective rights of petitioner and the Soviet Government could have been altered and that petitioner's right to plead the statute of limitations curtailed by force of an executive agreement between the President and the Soviet Government, we can find nothing in the agreement and assignment of November 16, 1933, which purports to enlarge the assigned rights in the hands of the United States, or to free it from the consequences of the failure of the Russian Government to prosecute its claim within the statutory period.\n The agreement and assignment are embodied in a letter of Mr. Litvinov, People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Government, to the President and the President's letter of the same date in reply. So far as now relevant the document signed in behalf of the Soviet Government makes mention of 'amounts admitted to be due or that may be found to be due it as the successor of prior governments or otherwise from American nationals, including corporations, companies, partnerships or associations.' It purports to 'release and assign all such amounts to the Government of the United States' and the Soviet Government agrees, preparatory to final settlement of claims between it and the United States and the claims of their nationals, 'not to make any claims with \n\n[304 \nU.S. 126, 143]\n\u00a0\n respect to ... (b) Acts done or settlements made by or with the Government of the United States, or public officials of the United States, or its nationals, relating to property, credits, or obligations of any Government of Russia or nationals thereof.' The relevant portion of the document signed by the President is expressed in the following paragraph: 'I am glad to have these undertakings by your Government and I shall be pleased to notify your Government in each case of any amount realized by the Government of the United States from the release and assignment to it of the amounts admitted to be due, or that may be found to be due.'\n There is nothing in either document to suggest that the United States was to acquire or exert any greater rights than its transferor or that the President by mere executive action purported or intended to alter or diminish the rights of the debtor with respect to any assigned claims, or that the United States, as assignee, is to do more than the Soviet Government could have done after diplomatic recognition-that is, collect the claims in conformity to local law. Even the language of a treaty wherever reasonably possible will be construed so as not to override state laws or to impair rights arising under them. United States v. De la Maza Arredondo, 6 Pet. 691, 748; Haver v. Yaker, 9 Wall. 32, 34; Dooley v. United States, \n182 \nU.S. 222, 230\n, 21 S.Ct. 762; Nielsen v. Johnson, \n279 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 49 S.Ct. 223, 224; Todok v. Union State Bank, \n281 \nU.S. 449, 454\n, 50 S.Ct. 363, 365. The assignment left unaffected the right of petitioner to set up against the United States the previous running of the statute of limitations.\n Fourth. Respondent assails the finding of the District Court that there was an unqualified repudiation by petitioner of its liability on the account, and in support of its contention presents an elaborate review of the evidence. The evidence is said to establish that petitioner's \n\n[304 \nU.S. 126, 144]\n\u00a0\n alleged repudiation was tentative and conditional, to await negotiations with a stable Russian Government upon its recognition by the United States. If this contention be rejected, respondent insists that at least there is a conflict in the evidence and in the inferences which may be drawn from it which, under the local practice, should have been resolved by a full trial rather than summarily on motion. As these questions were not passed on by the Court of Appeals, the case will be remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States v.

It recognized Mr. Bakhmeteff as Russian Ambassador from July 5, 1917, until June 30, 1922, when he retired, having designated Mr. Ughet as custodian of Russian property in the United States. Mr. Ughet, after his appointment as Financial Attache April 7, 1917, continued to be recognized as such by the United States until November 16, 1933. He was recognized by the United States as Charge d'Affaires ad interim, during the absence of the Ambassador from December 3, 1918, to July 31, 1919. Their diplomatic status as stated was certified in the present suit by the Secretary of State, who stated that he considered Mr. Ughet's status unaffected by the termination of the Ambassador's duties.\n Their status was certified to by the Department on October 31, 1918, and July 2, 1919, respectively, in Russian Government v.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1938)\nNo. 301\nArgued: Decided: March 28, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 493, 494]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Montgomery B. Angell and John W. Davis, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Edward J. Ennis, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Whether a deceased partner's taxable income for the calendar year 1933 includes his share of partnership profits from the beginning of the partnership fiscal year on August 1, 1933, to the date of his death in the same year, in addition to his share of the partnership profits for its fiscal year ending July 31, is the question for decision.\n Petitioner's testator, who died December 16, 1933, was a member of a New York partnership whose fiscal year expired on July 31, 1933. The partnership, with the addition of a new partner, was renewed, by agreement, for one year from August 1. After his death the surviving partners, by a further agreement, continued the partnership business from that date until July 31 of the next year, as of which date profits were to be determined, and thereafter from year to year. Decedent kept his books on the cash receipts and disbursements basis and filed his returns for income tax for each calendar year on that basis. The partnership kept its books on a like basis, but made its returns for a fiscal year ending July 31.\n Upon a partnership accounting as of the date of decedent's death, his share of the profits from August 1 to that date was ascertained and in the following January and February was paid to petitioner, as executor. In making return for taxation of decedent's income for 1933, petitioner included decedent's share of the firm profits accruing for the year ending July 31, but omitted to re- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 493, 495]\n\u00a0\n turn his share of the firm profits earned between that time and his death.\n The Commissioner's determination of a deficiency based on the omitted income, was set aside by the Board of Tax Appeals. 34 B.T.A. 384. The Board's order was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which held that decedent's share of the partnership profits for the year ending July 31 and for the ensuing period ending December 16, 1933, was income of decedent in 1933 and taxable as such for that year. 89 F.2d 692. We granted certiorari, \n302 \nU.S. 670\n, 58 S.Ct. 42, 82 L.Ed. --, the question being of importance in the administration of the revenue laws, and the decision being challenged by petitioner as not in harmony with Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., \n282 \nU.S. 359\n, 51 S.Ct. 150.\n Both by the practical construction given to the partnership agreement by petitioner and the surviving partners, and by the applicable provisions of the New York Partnership Act,1 decedent's death dissolved the partnership, terminated his right to share in the profits, and fixed the date as of which the surviving partners were bound to \n\n[303 \nU.S. 493, 496]\n\u00a0\n account for the profits. Darcy v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 66 F.2d 581. Decedent's estate in fact received the profits accrued on the date of his death, and partnership profits thus accrued and distributable by reason of the death of a partner are his income, taxable as such. Bull v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 247\n, 55 S.Ct. 695. But petitioner insists that here they cannot be included in decedent's 1933 income for purposes of taxation, since in that case his partnership profits both for the full year ending July 31, 1933 and for the ensuing four and one-half months' period ending with his death in December, would be taxed as his profits for a single year. This it is said offends against the policy of the revenue acts to assess income taxes annually on the basis of twelve month periods and, so offending, conflicts with the appropriate construction of the applicable provisions of sections 181, 182, of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 222, 26 U.S.C.A.  181 and note and section 188 note, relating to the taxation of partnership profits.\n Under the Act of 1932, as with earlier revenue acts, partnerships are not taxed upon their income. By section 189, 26 U.S.C.A.  187 and note, they are required to file information returns showing the partnership profits and the respective shares of the partners in the profits. But section 181, 26 U.S.C.A.  181 and note, provides that the partners shall be 'liable for income tax only in their individual capacity,' and section 182(a), 26 U.S.C.A.  188 note, reads:\n'General Rule.-There shall be included in computing the net income of each partner his distributive share, whether distributed or not, of the net income of the partnership for the taxable year. If the taxable year of a partner is different from that of the partnership, the amount so included shall be based upon the income of the partnership for any taxable year of the partnership ending within his taxable year.'\n\n Since the partnership is not a taxpayer, it has no taxable year in a literal sense. But as used in this section 'taxable year of the partnership' means its fiscal year, for 'taxable year' is defined by section 48, 26 U.S.C.A.  48 and note, as including in its meaning \n\n[303 \nU.S. 493, 497]\n\u00a0\n 'a fiscal year ... upon the basis of which the net income is computed' and 'fiscal year' is defined as 'an accounting period of twelve months ending on the last day of any month other than December.' A 'taxable year,' it is declared, includes the period for which a return is made when, under the provisions of the act or regulations, a return for a fractional part of a year is required. As a partner's profits are ascertainable only on an accounting for such periods as may be fixed by law or by the partnership itself, and as the fiscal year or accounting period of the partnership may differ from that of the taxable year of the partner, section 182(a), as a matter of convenience to taxpayers, authorizes and provides for this difference by requiring in that case that the partner's distributive share of the profits ascertained at the end of the partnership fiscal year shall be included in his taxable income for the year in which the fiscal year of the partnership ends.\n Petitioner does not complain of the taxation of decedent's share of the partnership profits for the year ending July 31 as 1933 income. But it contends that the reference in section 182(a) to the 'taxable year of the partnership,' and the requirement that the amount of the partner's taxable income 'shall be based upon the income of the partnership for any taxable year of the partnership ending within his taxable year,' read in their context and in the light of the practice long established by the revenue acts, of taxing income for twelve month periods, contemplate that a partner returning income for a calendar year shall be taxable in that year only upon his income from his firm for a single partnership year. This is said to be the case even though the income derived by a partner from the firm business between the end of the partnership fiscal year and the date of his death in the same year cannot be taxed in any other.\n This argument is, we think, based upon a misconception of the policy of the Act and a mistaken construction \n\n[303 \nU.S. 493, 498]\n\u00a0\n of section 182(a). It is true that the acts of Congress taxing income have consistently laid the tax upon the net income received by or accrued to the taxpayer in a 'taxable year,' which is either the calendar year or a different fiscal year, as the taxpayer may elect. But they have never undertaken to limit the income taxable in any one year to that derived from the taxpayer's activities occurring in that or any other single year. The items of gross income and of allowed deductions to be included in the income return, are those of the taxpayer for his taxable year, even though they may have resulted from or be affected by his business transactions of other years. Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., supra, \n282 \nU.S. 359, 364\n, 365 S., 51 S.Ct. 150, 151, 152. Circumstances wholly fortuitous may determine the year in which income, whenever earned, is taxable, and may thus affect the amount of tax. Receipt of income or accrual of the right to receive it within the tax year is the test of taxability, not the time it has taken the taxpayer to earn it nor the duration of his investments which have finally resulted in profit. Lucas v. Alexander, \n279 \nU.S. 573\n, 49 S.Ct. 426, 61 A.L.R. 906.\n The revenue acts have consistently adhered to that policy in taxing the income of a partner. Since the partner is entitled to profits only upon a partnership accounting at the end of an accounting period, his profits become subject to income tax when and as they are thus ascertained. As in the case of all other taxpayers, the partner's net income is required by the general provisions of section 41, 26 U.S.C.A.  41 and note, to be computed 'upon the basis of the taxpayer's annual accounting period,' here the calendar year, so as clearly to reflect the income. And section 182(a) commands that the distributive share of each partner in the partnership profits shall be included in computing his tax, whether distributed or not.\n By these provisions the taxable income of a partner is limited to that share of the partnership earnings to \n\n[303 \nU.S. 493, 499]\n\u00a0\n which he becomes entitled within his taxable year, but it includes all the distributive share of the partnership income which accrues to him in that year even though earned in an accounting period not wholly within the year, and though his return, as in the case of decedent, is on the cash receipts and disbursements basis. If the provisions stood alone it would seem plain that the profits accruing to decedent from the two partnership accountings within his taxable year would be taxable in that year, even though the accounting periods aggregated more than twelve months. We think the concluding sentence of section 182(a), which provides for the case where the partner's taxable year differs from that of the partnership, does not call for any different result.\n We need not inquire too meticulously whether the partnership 'taxable year,' within the meaning of section 182(a), includes in the special circumstances of this case an accounting period of less than twelve months, here from July 31 to the death of decedent. Petitioner makes no contention that it does not, nor could well do so, for if not so included it is not within the phrase 'any taxable year of the partnership,' occurring in the second sentence of section 182(a), on which petitioner relies to exclude the income for that period from taxation otherwise imposed by the general provisions of section 41 and the first sentence of section 182(a). The argument is that the year ending July 31, 1933, was one partnership fiscal year or accounting period, and that the ensuing period until the death of decedent was another, and that the inclusion of the income for both periods in decedent's taxable income is precluded by the use of the phrase 'any taxable year' in section 182(a), which it is said must be taken to mean any one accounting period of the partnership.\n But we think the sentence must be read as supplementing the preceding one and section 41, and not as limiting them. We can discern elsewhere in the Act no indication \n\n[303 \nU.S. 493, 500]\n\u00a0\n of any Congressional purpose to relieve business income from taxation in the year when, under the applicable provisions of the statute, it is distributable to a partner. Sections 11 and 12, 26 U.S.C.A.  11, 12 notes, declare in all inclusive terms that income taxes 'shall be levied, collected, and paid for each taxable year upon the net income of every individual.' It would require more precise words than those of section 182( a) directing that the taxable income of a partner shall be based on partnership income for 'any' accounting period of the partnership ending within its taxable year, to restrict the broad sweep of sections 11, 12 and 41, 26 U.S.C.A.  11, 12 notes, 41 and note. Cf. Heiner v. Colonial Trust Co., \n275 \nU.S. 232, 234\n, 235 S., 48 S.Ct. 65, 66; Helvering v. Stockholms Enskilda Bank, \n293 \nU.S. 84, 89\n, 55 S.Ct. 50, 52; United States v. Safety Car Heating & Lighting Co., \n297 \nU.S. 88, 93\n, 56 S.Ct. 353, 356; Helvering v. Gowran, \n302 \nU.S. 238, 243\n, 244 S., 58 S.Ct. 154, 156, 157.\n The purpose of section 182(a) when read, as it must be, with these other sections, is obviously not to relieve a partner from taxation of any part of the distributive share of the partnership income during the year in which it is distributable. The object is rather to make certain that 'the amount so included' in a partner's taxable income 'shall be based upon the income of the partnership' distributable during the partner's taxable year, even though an accounting period of the partnership ending in that year may not be wholly within it.\n This conclusion is supported by the legislative history of the second sentence of section 182(a). The provision first appeared in section 218(a) of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1070. As originally introduced, that section of the House bill which became the Revenue Act of 1918 provided for the taxation of the partner's distributive share of the net income of the partnership for 'the last annual accounting period of the partnership,' ending within his taxable year. By amendment the quoted phrase was stricken from the bill and the words 'any accounting period of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 493, 501]\n\u00a0\n the partnership' substituted. See H.R. 12863, 65th Cong., 3d Sess. ( Committee Print-As Agreed to in Conference). The amendment was obviously inconsistent with any purpose to limit the amount of the taxable income to that of any single or particular accounting period of the partnership ending within the partner's taxable year. The phrase was changed by section 182(a) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 840, to its present form, 'any taxable year of the partnership.' The continued use of the word 'any' as qualifying the phrase 'taxable year' in the 1928 and 1932 Acts, does not preclude the present tax if 'taxable year' be taken to mean a partnership accounting period of less than twelve months. Reasons have already been given why, if it means an accounting period of a full year, the present tax is nevertheless due under section 41 and the first sentence of section 182(a).\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice ROBERTS are of opinion that the judgment should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] New York Partnership Act, Laws of 1919, c. 408, Consol.Laws, c. 39:\n's 60.

COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY(1938)\nNo. 680\nArgued: March 29, 1938Decided: April 11, 1938\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles H. Houston and Leon A. Ransom, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioner. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 613, 614]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. E. Funk, of Frankfort, Ky., for the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Petitioner, a negro, was indicted in 1936 for murder in McCracken county, Ky. He moved to set aside the indictment upon the ground that the jury commissioners had excluded from the list from which the grand jury was drawn all persons of African descent because of their race and color and thus denied to him the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Constitution of the United States. In support of his motion, he presented an affidavit showing that the population of McCracken county was approximately 48,000, of which 8,000 were negroes; that the assessor's books for the county contained the names of approximately 6,000 white persons and 700 negroes who were qualified for jury service in accordance with the Kentucky Statutes,  2241; that the jury commissioners filled the wheel for jury service for 1936 with between 500 and 600 names exclusively of white citizens and that no negro was excluded 'because he was not an intelligent, sober, discreet and impartial citizen, resident housekeeper' of the county or of the requisite age; that the failure to draw any negro for service was not due to any of the disqualifications mentioned in the Kentucky Statutes,  2248. The affidavit further stated that petitioner could prove by sheriffs of McCracken county, serving respectively from 1906 to 1936, that during their terms no negroes had been summoned for service on any grand or petit jury in the county nor was the name of any negro placed in the hands of the sheriff to be so summoned; also that petitioner could prove by federal officials that for many years prior to 1936 negro citizens of the county had served on juries in the federal court at Paducah; also that petitioner could \n\n[303 \nU.S. 613, 615]\n\u00a0\n prove by many named citizens of standing in the community that for a long period of years there were negroes who were citizens of the county and qualified for service on juries in the state court. Petitioner alleged that the proof would show 'a long continued, unvarying and wholesale exclusion of negroes from jury service in this County on account of their race and color,' and that this practice had been 'systematic and arbitrary' on the part of the officers and commissioners selecting names for jury service for a period of 50 years or longer.\n Petitioner filed a supplemental affidavit stating that he had learned that in one case in the state court in 1921 the trial judge had directed a negro jury to be summoned from bystanders, but that those negro jurors were not on the jury panel.\n The attorney for the State stipulated that the original and supplemental affidavits should be considered as evidence and that the witnesses named would testify as therein set forth. No evidence to the contrary was introduced by the State. The motion to set aside the indictment was overruled. Petitioner then moved to discharge the entire panel of the jury for cause, upon the same facts, and the motion was denied.\n Petitioner, having reserved his exceptions, pleaded not guilty and the trial proceeded. He was convicted and sentenced to death. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the State. 269 Ky. 743, 108 S.W.2d 716, 718. It appears from an affidavit of the clerk of the circuit court of McCracken county that by inadvertence a copy of the motion to set aside the indictment was omitted from the record before the Court of Appeals. That court, after a summary of the facts shown by the record, said that the case was one 'where the proof might be regarded as sufficient to sustain the ground upon which the motion was evidently made, but there is wanting in the record a sufficient statement of those grounds to per- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 613, 616]\n\u00a0\n mit the introduction of that proof. The failure so pointed out is analogous,' the court said, 'to a case where there is proof without pleading, and the rule is that 'pleading without proof or proof without pleading' are each unavailable.'\n On petition for rehearing, the motion which had been omitted from the record was brought to the attention of the Court of Appeals. Rehearing was denied. On petition to this Court for certiorari the parties stipulated that the motion to set aside the indictment as filed by petitioner in the trial court might be read and considered as a proper part of the record. Certiorari was granted, \n303 \nU.S. 629\n, 58 S.Ct. 523, 82 L.Ed. --.\n On argument at this bar, the Attorney General of the State expressly disclaimed reliance upon the omission from the original record on appeal of the motion to set aside the indictment, as the fact of the motion had been brought to the attention of the Court of Appeals upon the application for rehearing, and conceded that, if the facts set forth in the affidavits submitted upon that motion were sufficient to show a denial of constitutional right, the judgment should be reversed.\n We are of the opinion that the affidavits, which by the stipulation of the State were to be taken as proof, and were uncontroverted, sufficed to show a systematic and arbitrary exclusion of negroes from the jury lists solely because of their race or color, constituting a denial of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed to petitioner by the Fourteenth Amendment.

Gen., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Claude R. Branch and John L. Hall, both of Boston, Mass., for respondents Welch and others.\n Mr. Wm. D. Mitchell, of New York City, for respondent Marshall.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioners ask us to hold that section 302(c) of the Revenue Act of 19261 as amended by the Joint Resolution of Congress of March 3, 1931,2 and section 803(a) of the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 303, 305]\n\u00a0\n Revenue Act of 1932,3 includes in the gross estate of decedent, for estate tax, property which, before the adoption of the amendments, was irrevocably transferred with reservation of a life estate to the transferor; and that, so applied, the statute does not offend the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. The numerous cases pending in the courts and the Board of Tax Appeals involving these questions, and the claim that decisions of this court have not settled the matter, moved us to grant certiorari.\n The respondents in No. 375 are executors under the will of a decedent who died November 20, 1932. On February 13, 1924, voluntarily and without valuable consideration, he transferred to a trustee property which he expected to receive under the will of his brother, reserving to himself the income for life, directing division of the income after his death between nephews and nieces and distribution of the corpus, upon the death of the survivor of them, amongst their then living issue. After his brother's death, and on October 22, 1926, he duly ratified and confirmed the original trust instrument. The Commissioner ruled that the value of the trust assets should be included in the decedent's gross estate, in the view that the transfer was testamentary, because made in contemplation of death, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death, within the meaning of section 302(c) of the Revenue Act of 1926. The respondents paid the resulting tax and sued for refund in the District Court of Massachusetts. Judgment went for the Collector. \n4\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the District Court erred in concluding that the transfer was made in contemplation of death or was intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after death. The petitioner nevertheless insisted upon the legality of the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 303, 306]\n\u00a0\n exaction as the decedent died after the 1931 and 1932 amendments of section 302(c), which declared the property transferred a part of the gross estate for computation of estate tax, in virtue of the reservation to the transferor of the income for his life. The court overruled the contention, holding that, if so retroactively enforced, the legislation violated the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, and reversed the judgment. \n5\n In his application for certiorari the petitioner did not assign error to the Circuit Court's ruling as to the nontestamentary character of the transfer, but confined his attack to the decision that the amendments of section 302(c) could not constitutionally be invoked to sustain the tax.\n In No. 484 it appears that the decedent died intestate June 4, 1933. The respondent, her son, is her administrator. November 15, 1920, she transferred to him certain cash and securities. On the same day they entered into an agreement reciting an understanding that, in case of his death during her life, the securities and cash should be reconveyed to her and, in the meantime, he should pay her such portions of the income therefrom as she might from time to time request in writing; that while he held the securities he might invest and reinvest; that he should bequeath her all the assets constituting the fund, in case she survived him; that she would reimburse him for any increased income taxes payable by him in virtue of his ownership of the fund and that, if she should survive him and take the property under his will, she would reimburse his estate for state and federal inheritance taxes due by reason of the bequest. The agreement contained other provisions for the safeguarding and separate cutody of the fund during the mother's life. The respondent paid the decedent portions of the income upon her request. He executed a will bequeath- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 303, 307]\n\u00a0\n ing the property to her on the terms mentioned in the agreement, but, upon her death, he revoked the bequest. The Commissioner included the value of the fund in the decedent's gross estate, holding that she had made a transfer within the terms of section 302(c) of the Revenue Act of 1926, as amended in 1931 and 1932. The Board of Tax Appeals reversed the Commissioner's determination and the Court of Appeals affirmed its action6 upon the authority of the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the First Circuit in No. 375 and that of the Seventh Circuit in No. 349, decided this day, Helvering v. Bullard, \n303 \nU.S. 297\n, 58 S.Ct. 565.\n Counsel for the government argue that the Joint Resolution of 1931 and section 803(a) of the Revenue Act of 1932 were intended to impose an estate tax measured by transfers of the sort therein described which had been irrevocably made prior to the passage of the legislation and that, so construed, they are not arbitrarily or unreasonably retroactive and do not offend the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Counsel for respondents answer that the enactments were intended to operate only upon transfers subsequently consummated and, if construed to reach the past transfers here involved, violate the amendment. We hold that the statutes are prospective in their operation and do not impose a tax in respect of past irrevocable transfers with reservation of a life interest.\n Ascertainment of the intended application of the Joint Resolution of March 3, 1931, and section 803(a) of the Revenue Act of 1932, involves a reading of them in the light of cases construing similar phraseology of earlier acts, their legislative history and administrative interpretation. There is agreement and section 803(a) re-enacted the substance of the Joint Resolution with but slight verbal differences. It will, therefore, be necessary to quote only \n\n[303 \nU.S. 303, 308]\n\u00a0\n the Resolution. By it section 302(c) of the Revenue Act of 1926, supra, was amended to provide:\n'The value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated ...\n\n'(c) To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death, including a transfer under which the transferor has retained for his life or any period not ending before his death (1) the possession or enjoyment of, or the income from, the property or (2) the right to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom; except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth.' 46 Stat. 1516\n\n\n\n The matter in ordinary type is section 302(c) as it was prior to amendment; the additions are in italics.\n The Government relies on the words 'at any time' as demonstrating that the legislation was intended to apply to transfers made before its adoption and is so unequivocal as to leave no room for construction. This phrase, appearing in an earlier revenue act, had, however, been held not to render the statute effective upon transfers antedating the passage of the act7 and Congress apparently realized that the expression did not carry the statute back so as to embrace transactions consummated before its passage; for, in subsection (h) of section 302 of the Revenue Act of 1926,8 in referring to transactions and interests \n\n[303 \nU.S. 303, 309]\n\u00a0\n giving rise to a tax by virtue of preceding subsections, it directed that they should be taxable 'whether made, created, arising, existing, exercised, or relinquished before or after the enactment of this Act ( February 26, 1926).'9 We conclude that the meaning of the section is not so free from doubt as to preclude inquiry concerning the legislative purpose.\n The history of the Resolution is of material aid in its construction. Section 302(c) of the Act of 1926, like earlier acts, measured the tax by the inclusion in the gross estate of property of which the decedent had made a voluntary transfer in contemplation of, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death. Notwithstanding the Treasury had ruled that a transfer of assets with a reservation of income for the donor's life came within the definition, this court held otherwise. 10 Dissatisfied with the decision, the Government sought a reversal of it but, in three judgments, announced on March 2, 1931, the ruling was reaffirmed. \n11\n In the opinions in these cases, which led to the preparation and adoption of the Resolution, the court said there was 'no question of the constitutional authority of the Congress to impose prospectively a tax with respect to transfers or trusts of the sort here involved.' There then remained one day of the current session of Congress. The Treasury drafted an amendment of section 302(c) to bring trusts of this type within its sweep, in the form of the Joint Resolution of March 3, 1931, which was sent to Congress on the day of our decisions and was passed, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 303, 310]\n\u00a0\n under a suspension of the rules, on the next day, the last of the session. 12\n Because its passage was considered exigent, the Resolution was adopted without having been printed and in reliance on statements made from the floor. The Congressional Record discloses the understanding of the Congress with respect to its scope. Mr. Garner, of the House Ways and Means Committee, stated: 'The Committee on Ways and Means this afternoon had a meeting and unanimously reported the resolution just passed. We did not make it retroactive for the reason that we were afraid that the Senate would not agree to it.' \n13\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Hawley, of the same committee, in charge of the Resolution, stated, in answer to a question, 'It provides that hereafter no such method shall be used to evade the tax' and, referring to the situation created by the decisions of this court, he said: 'It is entirely apparent that if this situation is permitted to continue, the Federal estate tax will be seriously affected. Entirely apart from the refunds that may be expected to result, it is to be anticipated that many persons will proceed to execute trusts or other varieties of transfers under which they will be enabled to escape the estate tax upon their property. It is of the greatest importance therefore that this situation be corrected and that this obvious opportunity for tax avoidance be removed. It is for that purpose that the joint resolution is proposed.'\n This language, we think, scarcely bears the interpretation put upon it by Government counsel-that the tax was meant to be laid on estates of all who died after the adoption of the Resolution.\n Bearing in mind that the Resolution was prepared and its passage recommended by the Treasury, the adminis- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 303, 311]\n\u00a0\n trative interpretation supports in uncommon measure the view that it was not intended to operate upon completed prior to its passage. Promptly upon its passage the Department issued T.D. 4314,14 approved by the Secretary of the Treasury May 22, 1931, which was in the form of a letter to collectors of internal revenue and others concerned. It quoted the language of the Resolution, and stated:\n'In view of the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States in Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531\n, 47 S.Ct. 710, 52 A.L. R. 1081 (T.D. 4072, C.B. Vi-2, 351), May v. Heiner, \n281 \nU.S. 238\n, 50 S.Ct. 286, 67 A.L.R. 1244 (Ct.D. 186, C.B. IX-1, 382), Coolidge v. Long, \n282 \nU.S. 582\n, 51 S.Ct. 306; Burnet v. Northern Trust Co., \n283 \nU.S. 782\n, 51 S.Ct. 342; Edgar M. Morsman, Jr. v. Burnet, \n283 \nU.S. 783\n, 51 S.Ct. 343; and Cyrus H. McCormick v. Burnet, \n283 \nU.S. 784\n, 51 S.Ct. 343, 75 L.E.d 1413, the portion added 343, the portion added Revenue Act of 1926, as set forth above in italic, will notwithstanding the provisions of section 302(h) of that Act, be applied prospectively only, i.e., to such transfers coming within the amendment as were made after 10.30 p.m., Washington, D.C., time, March 3, 1931.\n\n'Regulations 70, 1929 edition, will be amended to make the changes necessitated by the amendment to section 302(c) of the Revenue Act of 1926 and the above decisions of the Supreme Court.' (Italics in the original.)\n\n April 11, 1932, Regulations 70 were amended by T.D. 4336 and, in part, read: 'Art. 18. Retention of possession, enjoyment, or income.-Any transfer which was made by the decedent after 10.30 p.m., Washington, D.C., time, March 3, 1931, and under which he retained for his life or any period not ending before his death (1) the possession or enjoyment of, or the income from, the property or (2) the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 303, 312]\n\u00a0\n right to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom, is taxable, provided such transfer was not a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth.'\n Not only is the legislative history of section 803[a] of the Act of 1932 bare of indication of any purpose that it should affect past transfers, but what appears tends to disprove any such thought. \n15\n Moreover, the re-enactment of the Resolution of 1931 in the light of the administrative rulings requires the conclusion that Congress approved and adopted the administrative construction of the provision it re-enacted. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n Regulations 80, approved November 7, 1934, after paraphrasing section 803(a), concluded: 'The provisions of this subdivision do not apply (1) if the transfer was made prior to 10.30 p.m., eastern standard time, March 3, 1931, and (2) if the decedent died prior to 5 p.m. eastern standard time, June 6, 1932 (The date of passage of the Revenue Act of 1932). See section 506 of the Revenue Act of 1934 (26 U.S.C.A.  1691(b)).' This regulation was retained as Article 18 in the 1937 edition of Regulations 80 issued October 26, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 303, 313]\n\u00a0\n 1937. Thus while the regulations have been altered to treat section 803(a) of the 1932 act as retroactively affecting transfers made after March 3, 1931, the Department has consistently ruled that the Resolution of 1931 has no application to transfers made prior to its adoption. The position thus recently taken in inconsistent in its treatment of the two like enactments and is difficult to understand in view of the consistent interpretation of the Joint Resolution, but it fails to weaken the force of that consistent interpretation with knowledge of which Congress re- enacted the same provision in 1932.\n The Government urges that all of these circumstances which are persuasive that the enactments were intended to operate for the future are overborne by section 302(h) of the Revenue Act of 1926, which is: 'Except as otherwise specifically provided therein, subsections (b), (c), (d), (e ), (f), and (g) (of this section) shall apply to the transfers, trusts, estates, interests, rights, powers, and relinquishment of powers, as severally enumerated and described therein, whether made, created, arising, existing, exercised, or reinquished before or after the enactment of this Act (February 26, 1926).' (Italics supplied.)\n It will be remembered that the Joint Resolution of 1931 amended section 302(c) of the Act of 1926 to cover transfers such as are here involved. It made no reference to any other portion of that act. Since section 302(c) in its original form was, by section 302(h), made applicable to transfers whether made before or after the Act of 1926, the contention is that it has like operation and effect as respects the provision added to it by the amendment. And the same argument is advanced with respect to the amendment of subsection (c) by the Act of 1932.\n Resort is had to canons of constructions as an aid in ascertaining the intent of the Legislature. It may occur that the intent is so clear that no such resort should be indulged, and the Government claims this is such a case. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 303, 314]\n\u00a0\n The matter is, we think, involved in sufficient ambiguity to warrant our seeking such aid. A wellsettled canon tends to support the position of respondents: 'Where one statute adopts the particular provisions of another by a specific and descriptive reference to the statute or provisions adopted, the effect is the same as though the statute or provisions adopted had been incorporated bodily into the adopting statute . ... Such adoption takes the statute as it exists at the time of adoption and does not include subsequent additions or modifications by the statute so taken unless it does so by express intent.' 17 The weight of authority holds this rule respecting two separate acts applicable where, as here, one section of a statute refers to another section which alone is amended. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n In view of other settled rules of statutory construction, which teach that a law is presumed, in the absence of clear expression to the contrary, to operate prospectively;19 that, if doubt exists as to the construction of a taxing statute, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer, 20 we feel bound to hold that the Joint Resolution of 1931 and section 803( a) of the Act of 1932 apply only to transfers with reservation of life income made subsequent to the dates of their adoption respectively. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 303, 315]\n\u00a0\n Holding this view, we need not consider the contention that the statutes as applied to the transfers under consideration deprive the respondents of their property without due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n The judgments are affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 27, 44 Stat. 9, 70; U.S.C., tit. 26,  411(c). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Chapter 454, 46 Stat. 1516; U.S.C. tit. 26,  411(c). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Chapter 209, 47 Stat. 169, 279; U.S.C., tit. 26,  411(c), 26 U.S.C.

Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. John G. Frazer, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases, tried below in the federal court for Western Pennsylvania and argued together here, arise from the same facts and present the same questions of law. Each action was brought against D. B. Heiner, as former Collector of Internal Revenue and individually, to recover an amount paid under protest by the taxpayer in 1927 upon a deficiency assessment of his 1920 income tax. The amounts taxed as additional income were the distributive shares of certain profits alleged to have been earned by each in 1920 as a partner in two firms. Due demand for a refund was made. In No. 144 the taxpayer was A. W. Mellon; in No. 145, R. B. Mellon. Both having died, the suits are by their executors. In No. 144, the District Court entered judgment for $202,502.22 with interest ( 14 F.Supp. 424); in No. 145 for $187,787.17 with interest. These judgments were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 3 Cir., 89 F.2d 141. Certiorari was granted because \n\n[304 \nU.S. 271, 273]\n\u00a0\n of alleged conflict as to applicable rules of law important in the administration of the revenue laws. \n302 \nU.S. 672\n, 58 S.Ct. 21, 82 L.Ed. --.\n There is no dispute as to the relevant facts. Prior to December 12, 1918, A. W. Mellon, R. B. Mellon, and H. C. Frick each owned one-third of the entire capital stock of two distilling corporations-A. Overholt & Company and West Overton Distilling Company. On that day those three individuals formed two partnerships in which each partner was to have a one-third interest. In January, 1919, they caused to be transferred to the partnership called A. Overholt & Company all the assets of the corporation of that name; and to the partnership called West Overton Distilling Company, all the assets of that corporation. These assets included large whisky inventories in bonded warehouses. Neither corporation had distilled any whisky after 1916. Liquidation of the businesses of each had been started by the two corporations in 1918; and the partnerships had been organized for the purpose of liquidating them. The business of each partnership in 1920, had, like its business in 1919, consisted in the sale of whisky certificates and the storage, bottling, casing, and sale of the stock of whisky. It was not until 1925 that the assets of the partnerships then remaining were sold in bulk, and the proceeds distributed among those entitled thereto.\n Frick died December 2, 1919; but throughout 1920 the businesses of A. Overholt & Company and of West Overton Distilling Company were conducted, and their books were kept, in the same manner as the businesses had been conducted and books had been kept by the partnerships in 1919, and by the corporations in 1918. For 1920 the partnership returns of the two concerns disclosed factsfr om which it appeared that substantial gains had been made from the sale of whisky. But the amounts were not reported as income of the partnerships; and neither A. W. Mellon nor R. B. Mellon included in their income \n\n[304 \nU.S. 271, 274]\n\u00a0\n tax returns for 1920 any amount on account of them. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that these sums were distributive profits; that the returns of taxable income of A. W. Mellon and of R. B. Mellon for the year 1920 should have included one-third of the profits in that year of each firm from the sale of whisky; and made a deficiency assessment on A. W. Mellon of $190,419.70 and on R. B. Mellon of $175,259.70.\n The Revenue Act of 19181 governs taxation of 1920 income. Section 218( a) of the Act provides that individuals carrying on business in partnership shall be liable in their individual capacities for the income tax on profits earned therein, and that in computing the net income of each partner there shall be included his distributive share, whether distributed or not, of the net income of the partnership for the taxable year. Section 224 provides that the partnership shall file an informational return setting forth the items of its gross income, the deductions allowed and the distributive share of net income to which each partner is entitled.\n The two Mellons filed their individual returns for 1920, and also the informational partnership returns for that year. While the Mellons claimed that they were not taxable on their share of the profits from whisky sold in 1920, they recognized that they were taxable for their shares of these other profits of the concerns earned in 1920. The partnership returns in the case of each concern showed a gain arising from storage, bottling and casing operations, sales of barrels, interest and rentals. One-third of each of these profits was entered by each of the Mellons in his individual return as his distributive share of the profits of the two partnerships.\n First. The primary question for decision is whether the net profits made by the two partnerships in 1920 from the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 271, 275]\n\u00a0\n sales of whisky were in their nature taxable income. Throughout 1920, A. Overholt & Company and the West Overton Distilling Company were engaged in business. The mere fact that the purpose of the partnerships was to liquidate the assets taken over from the corporations is not of legal significance. Profits made in the business of liquidation are taxable in the same way and to the same extent as if made in an expanding business. Nor is it of legal significance that the liquidation was not completed until 1925 and that until completion of the liquidation it could not be known whether the business venture, taken as a whole, had been profitable. The federal income tax system is based on an annual accounting. \n2\n Under that law the question whether taxable profits have been made is determined annually by the result of the operations of the year.\n Purchasing real estate, subdividing and selling it in parcels is, in essence, a liquidating business. The claim has been repeatedly made that no income was realized until the investment was recouped; but the Board of Tax Appeals has uniformly held in accord with Article 43 of Regulations 45 ( and later regulations) that the cost of the real estate must be apportioned among all the lots, and income returned upon the sales in each year, regardless of the number of lots remaining undisposed of at the cos e of the tax year. \n3\n A like rule has been applied where the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 271, 276]\n\u00a0\n taxpayer had purchased personal property in a block and was engaged in selling it in parcels. The claim that there was no taxable income until the capital had been returned was rejected. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The fact that it might prove that when the business was fully liquidated the profits of 1920 were offset by heavy loss of later years is immaterial. Losses suffered by a taxpayer in a later year may be deducted from profits, if any, earned by him in that later year; but the tax on a year's income may not be withheld because losses may thereafter occur. If A. Overholt & Company and West Overton Distilling Company had remained corporations they would have been obliged to make each year return of the profits made therein and pay taxes annually throughout the perid of liquidation although it might ultimately prove that the losses of the later years exceeded the profits of the earlier ones. 5 Likewise, if the concerns had each been owned by a single individual, the fact that his sole business was liquidating the concern would not have relieved him from paying annually taxes on the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 271, 277]\n\u00a0\n net profits No good reason is suggested why a different rule should apply to partnerships.\n We conclude that gains from the sale of whisky in 1920 were income of that year. The amount of the income was determinable from the partnership books. Section 212(b) of the Revenue Act of 1918 provides that the net income shall be computed 'in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of' the taxpayer, and it is not shown that the method employed clearly failed to reflect net income.\n Second. The fact that the partnerships had been dissolved by Frick's death before 1920 does not affect the liability of the Mellons as surviving partners for income taxes on their distributive shares of the net profits made in that year. Compare Rossmoore v. Anderson, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 1 F.Supp. 35, affirmed, 2 Cir., 67 F.2d 1009; Rossmoore v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 76 F.2d 520. The business of A. Overholt & Company did not terminate on Frick's death. Although dissolved, the partnerships and the business continued, since, as stated in the Pennsylvania Uniform Partnership Act: 'On dissolution the partnership is not terminated, but continues until the winding up of partnership affairs is completed.' \n6\n Throughout the year 1920, the business of selling stock on hand and deriving income therefrom was carried on precisely as it had been theretofore, and for th  ame purpose. Article 424 of Regulations 45 recognizes that even in the hands of a receiver a partnership must file a return.\n Third. The Mellons contend, and the court below held, that the partners' interests in the partnerships were capitalized upon dissolution, so that until the liquidation returned to them the cost of their interests, no taxable income was received; that Article 1570 of Regulations 45 \n\n[304 \nU.S. 271, 278]\n\u00a0\n so provides; and that this did not take place before 1925. But, as already pointed out, technical dissolution does not affect the liability of a partner under section 218 for taxes on his distributive share of the partnership's income; and Article 1570 does not establish any rule that dissolution capitalizes the interest of a partner in future partnership profits. The article provides: 'When a partner retires from a partnership, or it is dissolved, he realizes a gain or loss measured by the difference between the price received for his interest and the cost to him or (if acquired prior thereto) the fair market value as of March 1, 1913, of his interest in the partnership, including in such cost or value the amount of his share in any undistributed partnership net income earned since February 28, 1913, on which income tax has been paid. ... This article is in no way inconsistent with the taxation of a partner on his share of the income of the partnership earned in a single year after dissolution but before completion of liquidation and distribution. It deals only with the determination of a partner's gain or loss on his investment when he completely severs his connection with the partnership and its assets. The gain or loss is determined substantially like that on any other business venture of the individual, treated as a whole. On the other hand, the profits from the sale of whisky in 1920 were current income of the partnership for that year, not different in their nature from the profits from storage, bottling, casing, and similar operations which the Mellons returned as income. Article 1570 does not deal with this situation.\n Fourth. The Mellons contend that because the partnerships were dissolved by the death of Frick in 1919, A. W. Mellon and R. B. Mellon, being surviving partners, became by operation of law liquidating trustees; that any income earned in 1920 from operations of the dissolved partnerships was income to the Mellons only in their \n\n[304 \nU.S. 271, 279]\n\u00a0\n fiduciary capacity as such trustees; that under section 219 of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1071, the trust estate was a separate taxable entity; that if any income tax was due, it was therefore due from the trust; and that its assessment is now barred by the statute of limitations.\n We do not find it necessary to determine whether assessment of the tax on this theory is now outlawed, or whether, as the Collector urges, recovery is precluded in any event under the doctrine of Stone v. White, \n301 \nU.S. 532\n, 57 S.Ct. 851; for we are of the opinion that the Mellons are not trustees within the meaning of section 219. The fact that they may be so denominated by the law of Pennsylvania, 59 P.S.Pa.  1 et seq., is not conclusive. It is well settled that in the interpretation of the words used in a federal revenue act, local law is not controlling unless the federal statute 'by express language or necessary implication, makes its own operation dependent upon state law.' 'The state law creates legal interests, but the federal statute determines when and how they shall be taxed.' Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103, 110\n, 53 S.Ct. 74, 77.7 We think it is clear that under the circumstances set forth, the income earned in 1920 was income of a partnership 'carrying on business' within the meaning of section 218 rather than of a trust under section 219.\n The obligation of the Mellons to pay, under the federal law, taxes on the profits made in 1920 from sales of \n\n[304 \nU.S. 271, 280]\n\u00a0\n whisky is in no way affected by their fiduciary obligation under the law of the State to account to the Frick estate for its interest in the two partnerships being liquidated. The surviving partners continued during 1920 to conduct the business from which they earned profits. On such income the federal law required that taxes be paid. It did not require that the payments be made from the partnership assets. How the assets shall be disposed of, and what shall be done with the proceeds when realized, are matters which may be determined by the law of the State or by agreement of the partners. But however the assets are required by the law of the State to be disposed of, or the proceeds applied, the federal law requires that taxes be paid if, in disposing of them within the year the business is conducted and profits are made.\n Fifth. The Mellons contend that under the law of Pennsylvania no distribution of profits could lawfully have been made by the surviving partners as liquidating trustees until all debts and liabilities, contingent or otherwise, had been paid or satisfied, and the partners' capital returned; and that although the business of the partnerships had been carried on after dissolution precisely as before, and the partnership accounts for the year 1920 showed large profits earned, their respective shares of them were not distributable and could not be deemed taxable income of the partners.\n Section 218(a) of the Revenue Act of 1918 provides that 'There shall be included in computing the net income of each partner his distributive share, whether distributed or not, of the net income of the partnership for the taxable year ....' If 'distributive' meant 'currently distributable under state law,' the contentions made by the Mellons might have some force. But it does not. Article 322 of Regulations 45 (and corresponding articles of subsequent Regulations) defines 'distributive' as meaning 'proportionate.' Compare Earle v. Commissioner, 1 Cir., \n\n[304 \nU.S. 271, 281]\n\u00a0\n 38 F.2d 965, 967, 968. And section 220 of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1072, taxing to the shareholders the income of a corporation improperly accumulating its gains and profits for the purpose of avoiding surtax, assumes that the two words are synonymous. The tax is thus imposed upon the partner's proportionate share of the net income of the partnership, and the fact that it may not be currently distributable, whether by agreement of the parties or by operation of law, is not materail. \n8\n No claim is made that the proportionate interests of the surviving partners was improperly determined by the Commissioner.\n Sixth. Finally, the Mellons contend that in 1928 and 1929 the Commissioner determined that no profit was realized until final liquidation of the partnerships in 1925, and that ico me taxes for that year have been collected on this theory and not yet refunded. The Commissioner's alleged change of position is not here important. It is not shown that refund of these taxes is now barred. Nor is it necessary for us to consider the cost to the Mellons of their interests in these partnerships, or whether the Mellons' 1925 income taxes were erroneously assessed and collected, or whether the Commissioner correctly settled the tax liability of the Frick estate. None of these questions has any bearing upon the determination of the case before us.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Burnet v.

The ruling of the Board of Tax Appeals that the taxpayer had no depletable interest (33 B.T. A. 910) was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 9 Cir., 90 F.2d 899. Because of an asserted conflict with the principles applicable under the decisions of this Court, we granted certiorari. \n302 \nU.S. 675\n, 58 S.Ct. 119, 82 L.Ed. --.\n Respondent in the years 1927 to 1930 operated a casinghead gasoline plant in the Signal Hill Oil Field, Los Angeles county, Cal. Respondent had entered into contracts with oil producers for the treatment of wet gas by the extraction of gasoline. The Board of Tax Appeals made the following findings: \n\n[303 \nU.S. 362, 365]\n\u00a0\n Natural gas, commonly known as 'wet gas' as it flows from the earth, is not a salable commodity. It is only through processing-by separation of the gasoline therefrom-rendering it dry, that it may be sold for commercial uses. Conversely, it is only through the separation of dry gas from wet gas that the gasoline is salable. It is this process that produces casinghead gasoline. The content of gasoline in wet gas varies from one-half gallon to six gallons a thousand cubic feet of gas produced, depending upon its richness. Respondent's contracts provided, generally, that it should install and maintain the necessary pipe lines and connections from casing-heads or traps at the mouth of the well to its plant, through which the producer agreed to deliver the natural gas produced at the well and that respondent should extract the gasoline therefrom, respondent to pay the producer 33 1\/3 per cent. of the total gross proceeds derived from the sale of gasoline extracted from wet gas, or, at producer's option, to deliver to the producer 33 1\/3 per cent. of the salable gasoline so extracted. A slightly different type of contract provided for the outright 'purchase' from the producer of all natural gas produced at a given well, the respondent paying 33 1\/3 per cent. of the gross proceeds received by it from the sale of the gasoline extracted from such gas. Some of the dry gas remaining after removal of the gasoline was blown to the air and wasted because there was no market for it, while some was sold to public utilities and in that case respondent accounted to the producer for a proportion of the proceeds provided for under the contract and some was returned to the wells to be used for pressure purposes.\n The government maintains that under the contracts respondent took no part in the production of the wet gas, conducted no drilling operations upon any of the producing premises, did not pump oil or gas from the wells, and \n\n[303 \nU.S. 362, 366]\n\u00a0\n had no interest as lessor or lessee, or as sublessor or sublessee, in any of the producing wells.\n Respondent states that in accordance with the provisions of the contracts it attached pipe lines to the various wells, carried the gas from those wells to its plant, where the gas from the wells of the different producers was commingled, and removed the gasoline therefrom. The gasoline was sold and respondent accounted to each producer 'for one- third of the proceeds of the producer's pro rata of the gasoline made.' Respondent contends that it was entitled to deduct for depletion 27 1\/2 per cent. of the difference between the price which it paid for the wet gas and its fair market value at the mouths of the wells. Respondent took the 'prevailing royalty,' which it deemed to be established by the evidence, as that market value, and treated the difference between the amount respondent paid and the greater prevailing royalty as respondent's gross income for the purpose of applying the statute. Revenue Act 1926,  204(c)(2), 234(a)(8), 44 Stat. 14, 41; Revenue Act 1928,  23(l)(m), 114( b)(3), 45 Stat. 799, 821, 26 U.S.C.A.  23 and note, 114 note.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals was of the opinion that respondent had acquired an economic interest in the wet gas in place and was entitled to an allowance for depletion. But, as no finding had been made of the market value of the wet gas, or of respondent's net income from the property, the court remanded the case to the Board of Tax Appeals to the end that respondent might supplement its proof and that an allowance for depletion should be made in accordance with the evidence produced.\n In order to determine whether respondent is entitled to depletion with respect to the production in question, we must recur to the fundamental purpose of the statutory allowance. The deduction is permitted as an act of grace. It is permitted in recognition of the fact that the mineral deposits are wasting assets and is intended as compensation to the owner for the part used up in production. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 362, 367]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Ludey, \n274 \nU.S. 295, 302\n, 47 S.Ct. 608, 610. The granting of an arbitrary deduction, in the case of oil and gas wells, of a percentage of gross income, was in the interest of convenience and in no way altered the fundamental theory of the allowance. United States v. Dakota-Montana Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 459, 467\n, 53 S.Ct. 435, 438. The percentage is 'of the gross income from the property,'-a phrase which 'points only to the gross income from oil and gas.' Helvering v. Twin Bell Syndicate, \n293 \nU.S. 312, 321\n, 55 S.Ct. 174, 178. The allowance is to the recipients of this gross income by reason of their capital investment in the oil or gas in place. Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551, 557\n, 53 S.Ct. 225, 226, 227.\n It is true that the right to the depletion allowance does not depend upon any 'particular form of legal interest in the mineral content of the land.' We have said, with reference to oil wells, that it is enough if one 'has an economic interest in the oil, in place, which is depleted by production'; that 'the language of the statute is broad enough to provide, at least, for every case in which the taxpayer has acquired, by investment, any interest in the oil in place, and secures, by any form of legal relationship, income derived from the extraction of the oil, to which he must look for a return of his capital.' Palmer v. Bender, supra. But the phrase 'economic interest' is not to be taken as embracing a mere economic advantage derived from production, through a contractual relation to the owner, by one who has no capital investment in the mineral deposit. See Thomas v. Perkins, \n301 \nU.S. 655, 661\n, 57 S.Ct. 911, 913\n\n\n It is plain that, apart from its contracts with producers, respondent had no interest in the producing wells or in the wet gas in place. Respondent is a processor. It was not engaged in production. Under its contracts with producers, respondent was entitled to a delivery of the gas produced at the wells, and to extract gasoline therefrom, and was bound to pay to the producers the stipulated amounts. Some of the contracts, reciting that the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 362, 368]\n\u00a0\n producer was the owner of the gas produced, provided for its treatment by respondent. Other contracts were couched in terms of purchase. In either case the gas was to be delivered to respondent at the casingheads or gas traps installed by the producer. Respondent had the right to have the gas delivered, but did not produce it and could not compel its production. The pipe lines and equipment, which respondent provided, facilitated the delivery of the gas produced but the agreement for their installation granted no interest in the gas in place. Nor was such an interest created by the provision for payment for the gas delivered, whether the payment was made in money out of the proceeds of the gasoline extracted or by delivery of the agreed portion of the gasoline. Whether or not the wet gas had a market value and, if it had, whether that value was greater than the amount respondent paid, is in no sense determinative. Respondent was still a processor, paying for what it received at the well's mouth. As the Board of Tax Appeals said, 33 B.T.A. 910: 'It is safe to say, we believe, that this petitioner (respondent) had no enforceable rights whatsoever under its contracts prior to the time the wet gas was actually placed in its pipe line, i.e., after it had passed beyond the casing-heads and gas traps supplied by the producer and into the pipe line, except the right, perhaps, to demand that the producer deliver whatever was produced through its pipe lines for treatment during the period of contractual relationship.'\n Undoubtedly, respondent through its contracts obtained an economic advantage from the production of the gas, but that is not sufficient. The controlling fact is that respondent had no interest in the gas in place. Respondent had no capital investment in the mineral deposit which suffered depletion and is not entitled to the statutory allowance. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 362, 369]\n\u00a0\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals in this relation is reversed and the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.\n No. 388.-In 1929, the State of California leased to J. H. Barneson oil and gas lands in Santa Barbara county, reserving a royalty. We assume, for the purposes of this case, as it was assumed below, that the lease was of tidelands owned by the state. Barneson acted on behalf of petitioner, the Bankline Oil Company, in obtaining the lease, which was duly assigned to petitioner and approved by the state. Claiming that the income received from operations under the lease was exempt from the federal income tax, upon the ground that such a tax would constitute an unconstitutional burden upon a state instrumentality, petitioner sought to recover the tax paid for the year 1930. The Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (33 B.T.A. 910), overruled petitioner's contention. 9 Cir., 90 F.2d 899. In view of the importance of the question, certiorari was granted. \n302 \nU.S. 675\n, 58 S.Ct. 119, 82 L.Ed . --.\n We are of opinion that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals was right. As petitioner was engaged in its own business in producing the oil, it was bound to pay a federal income tax upon its profits even though its operations were conducted on state lands. We are unable to find any substantial distinction between the instant case and that of Burnet v. A. T. Jergins Trust, \n288 \nU.S. 508\n, 53 S.Ct. 439, where the city of Long Beach, Cal., made an oil and gas lease to a private party covering part of a tract owned by the city, the proceeds of the oil and gas sales being divided between the city and the lessee. The claim of immunity by the lessee as an instrumentality of the state, acting through the city, was held to be untenable.\n So far as the case of Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., \n285 \nU.S. 393\n, 52 S.Ct. 443, which was distinguished in Burnet v. A. T. Jergins Trust, supra, may be regarded as supporting a dif- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 362, 370]\n\u00a0\n ferent view, it is disapproved. See Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corporation, \n303 \nU.S. 376\n, 58 S.Ct. 623, decided that day.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals with respect to petitioner's income from the lease is affirmed.\n Judgment in No. 387 reversed; in No. 388 affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur in the result. \n\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v.

Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Walter G. Moyle, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Whether Bashford is liable for a deficiency in the income taxes assessed for the year 1930 depends upon whether Atlas Powder Company was, as defined by section 112(i)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A.  112 note, 'a party to the reorganization' of the Peerless Explosives Company.\n Atlas Powder Company desired to eliminate the competition of three concerns-Peerless Explosives Company, Union Explosives Company, and Black Diamond Powder Company. Deeming it unwise to do so by buying either their stock or their assets, Atlas conceived and consummated a plan for consolidating the three competitors into a new corporation, with Atlas to get a majority of its stock. To this end holders of the stock of the three companies were duly approached by individuals who represented Atlas; their agreements to carry out the plan were obtained; the new corporation was formed and became the owner practically of all the stock, and all the assets, of the three competitors; Atlas became the owner of all the preferred stock and 57 per cent. of the common stock of the new corporation; and in exchange for the stock in the three companies each of the former stockholders re- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 454, 456]\n\u00a0\n ceived some common stock in the new company, some Atlas stock, and some cash which Atlas supplied.\n Bashford, one of the stockholders in Peerless, received in exchange for his stock 2,720.08 shares of the common stock of the new corporation, $ 25,306.67 in cash, 625 shares of Atlas preferred, and 1,344 shares of Atlas common. In his income tax return for the year 1930 he included all the cash, but did not include the gain on stock of either the new corporation or Atlas. The Commissioner concedes that gain on the stock in the new corporation was properly omitted, since the new company was a 'reorganization' of Peerless. He insists that the Atlas stock should have been included, as it was 'other property' on which gain was taxable under section 112(c)(1) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A.  112(c)(1) and note, since Atlas was not 'a party to the reorganization.' The Board of Tax Appeals (33 B.T.A. 10) held that Atlas was 'a party to the reorganization,' and hence that gain on its stock was properly omitted by Bashford. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed that judgment. 87 F.2d 827. Because of alleged conflict of the decision with Commissioner v. Groman, 7 Cir., 86 F.2d 670, we granted certiorari in both cases.\n In Groman v. Commissioner, \n302 \nU.S. 82, 654\n, 58 S.Ct. 108, 112, decided by us November 8, 1937, we gave the following construction to the reorganization sections here involved:\n'Where, pursuant to a plan, the interest of the stockholders of a corporation continues to be definitely represented in substantial measure in a new or different one, then to the extent, but only to the extent, of that continuity of interest, the exchange is to be treated as one not giving rise to present gain or loss.'\n\n Applying the rule, we held there that the Glidden stock received by Groman was 'other property' and he, therefore, liable on the deficiency assessment; because the Glidden Company was not 'a party to the reorganiza- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 454, 457]\n\u00a0\n tion,' although it had, pursuant to agreement with the stockholders of the Indiana corporation, caused it to be reorganized as an Ohio corporation; had taken for itself all the common stock of Ohio; and had distributed among the former stockholders of Indiana the Ohio preferred stock and some Glidden stock, as well as cash, which it supplied. Applying the rule here, we hold likewise that the Atlas stock was 'other property' and Bashford, therefore, liable on the deficiency assessment; because the Atlas Powder Company was not 'a party to the reorganization.'\n Bashford contends that there is a clear distinction in the facts between the case at bar and the Groman Case which should lead to a different conclusion here. The differences mainly relied upon are these:\n\n 1. \nIn the Groman Case, the court found that Glidden did not acquire a majority of the shares of the voting stock and a majority of the shares of all other classes of stock involved, whereas here the facts were as follows: Atlas acquired 'not only a majority of the voting stock and a majority of the stock of all other classes of another corporation (the new company) in the reorganization, but of all the other corporations ( Peerless and Union) in the reorganization.'\n\n 2. \n'Atlas acquired as part of the plan, substantially all of the shares of Peerless and Union in direct exchanges with the taxpayers and the other stockholders of those companies in part consideration for which it delivered to the shareholders 6,318 shares of Atlas preferred stock and 8712 1\/2 shares of common.'\n\n 3. \n'Atlas, unlike Glidden was a party to all the exchanges, while the new company was a party only to exchanges with Atlas.'\n\n 4. \n'The stockholders of Peerless and Union did not participate in the contract or exchange between Atlas and the new company.' \n\n[302 \nU.S. 454, 458]\n\u00a0\n Any direct ownership by Atlas of Peerless, Black Diamond, and Union was transitory and without real substance; it was part of a plan which contemplated the immediate transfer of the stock or the assets or both of the three reorganized companies to the new Atlas subsidiary. Hence, under the rule stated, the above distinctions are not of legal significance. The difference in the degree of stock control by the parent company of its subsidiary and the difference in the method or means by which that control was secured are not material. The participation of Atlas in the reorganization of its competitors into a new company which became a subsidiary did not make Atlas 'a party to the reorganization.' The continuity of interest required by the rule is lacking.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of opinion that the Board of Tax Appeals and the Circuit Court of Appeal, reached the right conclusion, and that the judgment below should be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v. BULLARD(1938)\nNo. 349\nArgued: February 1, 1938Decided: February 28, 1938\n\n\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 297, 298]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings. Atty. Gen., and James W. Morris, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Samuel S. Holmes, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner challenges a decision holding unconstitutional the provision of section 302(c) of the Revenue Act of 1926,1 as amended by Joint Resolution of Congress of March 3, 1931,2 which requires the inclusion in a decedent's gross taxable estate of property transferred by irrevocable deed with reservation of a life estate. On account of alleged conflict with our decisions and of the important constitutional question presented we granted the writ of certiorari, \n302 \nU.S. 671\n, 58 S.Ct. 49, 82 L.Ed. --.\n Clara R. Smith, a resident of Illinois, died in 1933. In 1927 she transferred securities, by irrevocable deed, to her son Edward, in trust to pay the income to her for life and, upon her death, to divide the corpus into three equal parts, the income from a part to be paid to each of her three children, Lora, Bessie, and Edward, during their lives, with remainders of the daughters' shares to their respective children; upon Edward's death leaving no issue the income from his share to be paid to his widow for life and, upon her death, the remainder to be added, in equal shares, to the daughters' trust funds. Edward died in 1928 leaving a widow but no issue. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 297, 299]\n\u00a0\n In 1931 dissatisfaction with the administration of the trust impelled the decedent to seek its abrogation. Examination of the instrument disclosed violation of the rule against perpetuities. A bill was accordingly filed in an Illinois state court to have the trust declared void. The son's widow answered denying invalidity. A guardian ad litem representing the interests of infant beneficiaries in remainder also opposed the prayer of the bill. Subsequently, to avoid family discord and amicably to settle the pending litigation, a compromise agreement was made by the decedent and all the adult beneficiaries consenting to the entry of a decree on condition that the decedent would declare a new trust of approximately one-third of the securities in the existing trust whereby Edward's widow should enjoy a life interest identical to that given her by the 1927 trust and, upon her death, the remainder should be equally divided between the decedent's daughters. The agreement further required the making of testamentary provision for the decedent's daughters and grandchildren, and certain outright gifts to the latter. In pursuance of the agreement, the decedent, on February 17, 1932, executed a new irrevocable deed of trust conveying approximately one-third of the corpus of the former trust and reserving to herself a life interest in the income, and executed a new will. A consent decree was then entered in the equity suit, the guardian ad litem representing to the court that the settlement would be advantageous to the minor beneficiaries.\n The Commissioner's inclusion of the corpus of the trust of February 17, 1932, in the gross estate was sustained by the Board of Tax Appeals. \n3\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board's decision. \n4\n We are of opinion that the action of the Commissioner and the Board should have been affirmed. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 297, 300]\n\u00a0\n First. Both the Board and the Court held that the decree of the state court, notwithstanding its entry pursuant to stipulation, adjudicated the rights of the parties, abrogated the trust of 1927, and established the decedent's absolute ownership of the assets. This conclusion is fully supported by decisions of the Supreme Court of Illinois, and we accept it. It follows that the respondent's contention that the transfer of 1932 has no independent existence and that, in legal effect, the trust for the son's widow stems from the deed of 1927, must be overruled.\n Second. The trust of 1932 was created after the adoption of the Joint Resolution of March 3, 1931, which required inclusion in the gross estate of the value at the date of death of all property to the extent of any interest therein of which a decedent has at any time made a transfer by trust or otherwise under which the transferor retained for life the possession or enjoyment of the income from the property, except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth. It is urged that the settlement of the dispute as to the invalidity of the trust deed of 1927, conditioned, as it was, upon the making of the new trust, constitutes such a bona fide sale, for adequate consideration, as to bring the trust of 1932 within the exception. The argument is that the decree setting aside the 1927 trust merely gave judicial sanction to the compromise agreement and that the contract was for an adequate and valuable consideration and would, therefore, have been enforced by a court of equity at the instance of any of the parties to it.\n While recognizing that a decree thus begotten has the same force and effect as a decree in invitum, the respondent seeks to go behind the decree and spell out a sale by Edward's widow of her interest under the 1927 trust for the interest conferred upon her by the 1932 trust. The court below has held the position untenable, and we \n\n[303 \nU.S. 297, 301]\n\u00a0\n agree. The decree declared the 1927 trust void and revested the trust assets in the decedent. If that trust was, as the Illinois court decreed, void and ineffective because it violated the rule against perpetuities the son's widow took no interest under it and gave nothing to procure the 1932 transfer.\n Third. The Commissioner relies not only upon the Joint Resolution of March 3, 1931, but upon section 803(a) of the Revenue Act of 1932.5 We need not consider the latter, since the Joint Resolution, if legally enforceable, in express terms authorized his inclusion of the trust fund in the decedent's gross estate. As the Resolution was adopted nearly a year prior to the creation of the 1932 trust, no claim is or can be made that, as to that transaction, if is retroactive. The contention is that the transfer was inter vivos, was presently effective, was irrevocable, was not made in contemplation of, or effective at, death, and that Congress was, therefore, without power to make it the subject of an estate or inheritance tax; that, while the transfer might, by appropriate legislation, have been taxed as a gift, to tax it as in the nature of a testamentary disposition is a denial of due process. The contention is unsound for several reasons. Since Congress may lay an excise upon gifts, it is of no significance that the exaction is denominated an estate tax or is found in a statute purporting to levy an estate tax. Moreover, Congress having the right to classify gifts of different sorts might impose an excise at one rate upon a gift without reservation of a life estate and at another rate upon a gift with such reservation. Such a classification would not be arbitrary or unreasonable. A further vindication of the exaction is the authority of Congress to treat as testamentary transfers with reservation of a \n\n[303 \nU.S. 297, 302]\n\u00a0\n power or an interest in the donor. The legislative history of the Joint Resolution, to which reference is made in Hassett v. Welch, \n303 \nU.S. 303\n, 58 S.Ct. 559, decided this day, demonstrates that the purpose of the legislation was to prevent avoidance of estate taxes. As has been said by the Court of Appeals of New York:6 'It is true that an ingenious mind may devise other means of avoiding an inheritance tax, but the one commonly used is a transfer with reservation of a life estate.'\n We have recently sustained the prospective operation of a provision including in the gross estate property which a decedent has transferred retaining power alone, or in conjunction with any other person, to alter, amend, or revoke. 7 We held the purpose of the clause was to prevent avoidance of tax and the measure was reasonably calculated to that end. As applied to a trust created after its enactment the Joint Resolution does not violate the Fifth Amendment.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 27, 44 Stat. 9, 70; U.S.C. tit. 26,  411(c). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Chapter 454, 46 Stat. 1516; U.S.C. tit. 26,  411(c). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 34 B.T.A. 243. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] 7 Cir., 90 F.2d 144. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Chapter 209, 47 Stat. 169, 279; U.S.C., tit. 26,  411(c), 26 U.S.C.

Graufner, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question to be decided is whether payments received by a corporation as a stockholder in another corporation, upon the latter's complete liquidation, are to be treated as payments upon a sale or exchange of the stock under  23(r)(1) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 183, 26 U.S.C.A.  23, which allows the deduction of losses from sales or exchanges of stock, not held for more than two years, only to the extent of the gains from such sales or exchanges.\n On August 9, 1932, respondent, a California corporation, purchased shares of stock in another corporation. In the following year the latter was completely liquidated. The liquidating dividends received by respondent amounted to less than the cost of the stock. In its income tax return for 1933 respondent deducted the full amount of the loss from gross income. The commissioner ruled that, since the loss was sustained upon an exchange of stock held less than two years and the respondent had received no gains against which the loss could be applied, the deduction was forbidden by  23(r)(1), and he found a deficiency accordingly. The order of the Board of Tax Appeals sustaining the deficiency was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Weaver Co. v. Com'r, 97 F.2d 31. We granted certiorari, \n305 \nU.S. 585\n, 59 S.Ct. 95, 83 L.Ed. --, to resolve the conflict between the decision of the court below and that of the Court of Claims in White v. United States, 21 F.Supp. 361, this day affirmed on certiorari in White v. United States, \n305 \nU.S. 281\n, 59 S.Ct. 179.\n Section 23(f), 47 Stat. 180, 26 U.S.C.A.  23(f) provides that losses sustained by corporations during the taxable year shall be allowed as deductions in computing net income, subject to the limi- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 293, 295]\n\u00a0\n tations provided in subsection (r). Subsection (r)(1) declares:\n'Losses from sales or exchanges of stocks and bonds ... which are not capital assets (as defined in section 101) shall be allowed only to the extent of the gains from such sales or exchanges ....' By  101 \" Capital assets' means property held by the taxpayer for more than two years ....' 26 U.S.C.A.  101. Since the loss sustained by respondent was not from the sale or exchange of the stock, it is contended that subsection (r) has no application and that the loss is deductible in full, as are other losses, under  23(f). Whether  23(f) or 23(r) applies must be answered by deciding whether, under  115(c), 26 U.S.C.A.  115, stockholders' losses upon a corporate liquidation are to be treated, for purposes of computation of the tax, in the same manner as losses upon a sale or exchange of the stock.\n\n The scheme of the 1932 Act, as respects the treatment of gains and losses upon the sale or exchange of property on a different basis from other types of gain or loss, is substantially that of the 1928 Act, which we have considered in White v. United States, supra. The provisions of  12(c), 22(d), (e), 23, 101, 111, 112, 113 and 115(c) of the 1928 Act, 45 Stat. 797, 799, 811, 815-818, 822, 26 U.S.C.A.  22, 23, 101, 111-113, 115, discussed in the White Case, so far as now relevant were reenacted in the same numbered sections of the 1932 Act, 47 Stat. 177, 179, 191, 195- 197, 204, 26 U.S.C.A.  22, 23, 101, 111-113, 115. The considerations which in that case led us to the conclusion that  115(c) of the 1928 Act had placed stockholders' gains and losses from liquidations on the same basis as gains and losses from sales of the stock for purposes of computation of the tax, lead us to the same conclusion with respect to the 1932 Act.\n We find nothing in the language or history of  23(r) to suggest that Congress, in enacting it, had any purpose \n\n[305 \nU.S. 293, 296]\n\u00a0\n to restrict the operation of  115(c) as we have construed it. Section 23( r), like  101 in the 1932 and earlier Acts, speaks of losses resulting only from sales or exchanges. But the one does not more than the other restrict the operation of the provisions of  115 and 112, which accord to losses on liquidation the same recognition accorded by  23(r) to losses upon sales. Congress, in enacting the 1934 Act, recognized that under that of 1932 '... a distribution in liquidation of a corporation is treated in the same manner as a sale of stock.' Report of Senate Committee on Finance, No. 558, 73rd Cong., 2nd Sess., p. 37. To prevent avoidance of surtax through liquidation of corporations with large surpluses, Congress found it necessary to place gains on liquidations on a different basis from gains on sales. It accomplished this by amending  115(c) to provide: 'Despite the provisions of section 117(a) ( corresponding to  101 in the earlier Acts specially taxing capital gains and losses) 100 per centum of the gain so recognized shall be taken into account in computing net income.' 26 U.S.C.A.  115(c).\n It follows that the extent to which the taxpayer can deduct the loss is controlled by  23(r)(1), and that since the stock was held for less than two years and there were no gains against which the loss could be offset, it can not be deducted from gross income.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice BUTLER and Mr. Justice ROBERTS dissent. \n\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v.

Com'r of Internal Revenue, 9 Cir., 91 F.2d 127. Certiorari was granted ( \n302 \nU.S. 677\n, 58 S.Ct. 142, 82 L.Ed. --) because of an asserted conflict with the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Commissioner v. Fleming, 82 F.2d 324.\n Respondent is a California corporation which acquired certain properties consisting of oil and gas prospecting permits, drilling agreements, leases and equipment. Development work resulted in the discovery of oil. On October 3, 1927, respondent conveyed all its right, title and interest in the described properties to the Honolulu Consolidated Oil Company. The latter agreed to pay to respondent $350,000 upon the execution of the agreement and, if the Honolulu Company should not elect to abandon the purchase (in accordance with one of the stipulations), the additional sums of $400,000 in each of the years 1928, 1929 and 1930, and the further sum of $450,000 in 1931. After the time when the Honolulu Company had been fully reimbursed as provided in the agreement for all its expenditures in the acquisition, development and operation of the properties, respondent was to receive monthly one-third of the net profits resulting from the production and operation. After careful stipulations with respect to such reimbursement and the computation of net profits, the agreement provided:\n'Anything in this agreement contained to the contrary notwithstanding, it is the intention of the parties to this agreement that the full ownership, possession and control of all the properties, the subject of this agreement, and of all of the personal property acquired and\/or used on and in connection with the operation and development of the properties, the subject of this agreement, shall be vested in Honolulu, and Elbe shall have no interest in or to said properties or in or to any personal property used on or in connection with the operation or development of the said properties or in or to the salvage value of any thereof, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 372, 375]\n\u00a0\n except as provided by paragraph 9' (relating to abandonment of the purchase and reconveyance).\n\n The first payment of $350,000 was received by respondent in 1927 and, being greater than the cost of all the properties transferred, respondent reported as taxable income the difference between that cost basis and the amount received. In its income tax returns for the years 1928 and 1929, respondent reported the payments of $400,000 received in each of the years and claimed 27 1\/2 per cent. thereof as an allowance for depletion. This is the claim which has been sustained below.\n We agree with the conclusion of the Board of Tax Appeals that the contract between the respondent and the Honolulu Company provided for an absolute sale of all the properties in question, including all the oil and gas in place, and that respondent did not retain any interest or investment therein. The aggregate sum of $2,000,000 was paid as an agreed purchase price to which was to be added the one-third of the net profits payable on the conditions specified. We are unable to conclude that the provision for this additional payment qualified in any way the effect of the transaction as an absolute sale or was other than a personal covenant of the Honolulu Company. See Helvering v. O'Donnell, \n303 \nU.S. 370\n, 58 S.Ct. 619, decided this day In this view, neither the cash payments nor the agreement for a share of subsequent profits constituted an advance royalty, or a 'bonus' in the nature of an advance royalty, within the decisions recognizing a right to the depletion allowance with respect to payments of that sort. Such payments are made to the recipient as a return upon his capital investment in the oil or gas in place. See Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103, 111\n, 112 S., 53 S.Ct. 74, 77; Murphy Oil Company v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 299, 302\n, 53 S.Ct. 161, 162. Payments of the purchase price which are received upon a sale of oil and gas properties are in a different category. The words 'gross income from the property,' as used in the statute governing the allowance for depletion, mean gross in- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 372, 376]\n\u00a0\n come received from the operation of the oil and gas wells by one who has a capital investment therein,-not income from the sale of the oil and gas properties themselves. See Darby-Lynde Company v. Alexander, 10 Cir., 51 F. 2d 56, 59. We conclude that, as respondent disposed of the properties, retaining no investment therein, it was not entitled to make the deduction claimed for depletion. Palmer v.

GERHARDT(1938)\nNo. 779\nArgued: Decided: March 7, 1938\n\n\n The basis upon which constitutional tax immunity of a state has been supported is the protection which it affords to the continued existence of the state. To attain that end it in to ordinarily necessary to confer on the state a competitive advantage over private persons in carrying on the operations of its government. There is \n\n[304 \nU.S. 405, 422]\n\u00a0\n no such necessity here, and the resulting impairment of the federal power to tax argues against the advantage. The state and national governments must coexist. Each must be supported by taxation of those who are citizens of both. The mere fact that the economic burden of such taxes may be passed on to a state government and thus increase to some extent, here wholly conjectural, the expense of its operation, infringes no constitutional immunity. Such burdens are but normal incidents of the organization within the same territory of two governments, each possessed of the taxing power.\n During the present term we have held that the compensation of a state employee paid from the state treasury for his service in liquidating an insolvent corporation, where the state was reimbursed from the corporate assets, was subject to income tax. Helvering v. Therrell, McLoughlin v. Commissioner, \n303 \nU.S. 218\n, 58 S.Ct. 539, decided February 28, 1938. But the Court has never ruled expressly on the precise question whether the Constitution grants immunity from federal income tax to the salaries of state employees performing, at the expense of the state, services of the character ordinarily carried on by private citizens. The Revenue Act of 1917, considered in Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, supra, exempted the salaries of all state employees from income tax. But it was held in that case that neither the constitutional immunity nor the statutory exemption extended to independent contractors. In Brush v. Commissioner, supra, the applicable treasury regulation upon which the Government relied exempted from income tax the compensation of 'state officers and employees' for 'services rendered in connection with the exercise of an essential governmental function of the State'. The sole contention of the Government was that the maintenance of the New York City water supply system was not an essential governmental function of the state. The Government did not attack the regulation. No contention was made \n\n[304 \nU.S. 405, 423]\n\u00a0\n by it or considered or decided by the Court that the burden of the tax on the state was so indirect or conjectural as to be but an incident of the co-existence of the two governments, and therefore not within the constitutional immunity. If determination of that point was implicit in the decision it must be limited by what is not decided.\n The pertinent provisions of the regulation applicable in the Brush Case were continued in Regulations 77, Article 643, under the 1932 Revenue Act, until January 7, 1938, when they were amended to provide that 'Compensation received for services rendered to a State is to be included in gross income unless the person receives such compensation from the State as an officer or employee thereof and such compensation is immune from taxation under the Constitution of the United States.' The applicable provisions of section 116 of the 1932 Act do not authorize the exclusion from gross income of the salaries of employees of a state or a state-owned corporation. If the regulation be deemed to embrace the employees of a state-owned corporation such as the Port Authority, it was unauthorized by the statute. But we think it plain that employees of the Port Authority are not employees of the state or a political subdivision of it within the meaning of the regulation as originally promulgated-an additional reason why the regulation, even before the 1938 amendment, was ineffectual to exempt the salaries here involved.\n The reasoning upon which the decision in Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States, supra, was rested is not controlling here. Taxation of the sale to a state, which was thought sufficient to support the immunity there, is not now involved. Whether the actual effect upon the performance of the state function differed from that of the present tax we do not now inquire. Compare WheelerLu mber Bridge & Supply Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 572\n, 50 S.Ct. 419. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 405, 424]\n\u00a0\n As was pointed out in Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, supra, page 524, 46 S.Ct. page 174, there may be state agencies of such a character and so intimately associated with the performance of an indispensable function of state government that any taxation of it would threaten such interference with the functions of government itself as to be considered beyond the reach of the federal taxing power. If the tax considered in Collector v. Day, supra, upon the salary of an officer engaged in the performance of an indispensable function of the state which cannot be delegated to private individuals, may be regarded as such an instance, that is not the case presented here.\n Expressing no opinion whether a federal tax may be imposed upon the Port Authority itself with respect to its receipt of income or its other activities, we decide only that the present tax neither precludes nor threatens unreasonably to obstruct any function essential to the continued existence of the state government. So much of the burden of the tax laid upon respondents' income as may reach the state is but a necessary incident to the coexistence within the same organized government of the two taxing sovereigns, and hence is a burden the existence of which the Constitution presupposes. The immunity, if allowed, would impose to an inadmissible extent a restriction upon the taxing power which the Constitution has granted to the federal government.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, concurring.\n I agree that this cause should be reversed for the reasons expressed in that part of the opinion just read pointing out that: respondents, though employees of the New York Port Authority, are citizens of the United States; \n\n[304 \nU.S. 405, 425]\n\u00a0\n the tax levied upon their incomes from the Authority is the same as that paid by other citizens receiving equal net incomes; and payment of this nondiscriminatory income tax by respondents cannot impair or defeat in whole or in part the governmental operations of the State of New York. A citizen who receives his income from a State owes the same obligation to the United States as other citizens who draw their salaries from private sources or the United States and pay Federal income taxes.\n While I believe these reasons, without more, are adequate to support the tax, I find it difficult to reconcile this result with the principle announced in Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, and later decisions applying that principle. This leads me to the conclusion that we should review and re-examine the rule based upon Collector v. Day. That course would logically require the entire subject of intergovernmental tax immunity to be reviewed in the light of the effect of the U.S.C.A.Const. Sixteenth Amendment authorizing Congress to levy a tax on incomes 'from whatever source derived'; and, in that event, the decisions interpreting the Amendment would also be re-examined. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n From time to time, this Court has relied upon a doctrine evolved from Collector v. Day, under which incomes received from State activities thought by the Court to be nonessential are held taxable, while incomes from activities thought to be essential are held nontaxable. The opinion of the Court in this case refers to that doctrine. Application of this test has created 'a zone of debatable ground within which the cases must be put upon one side or the other of the line by what this court has called the gradual process of historical and judicial 'inclusion and exclusion.\" Brush v. Cmm issioner, \n300 \nU.S. 352, 365\n, 57 S.Ct. 495, 498, 108 A.L.R. 1428. Under this rule the tax status of every State employee re- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 405, 426]\n\u00a0\n mains uncertain until this Court passes upon the classification of his particular employment. The result is a confusion in the field of intergovernmental tax immunity which I believe could be clarified by complete review of the subject. Testing taxability by judicial determination that State governmental functions are essential or nonessential contributes much to the existing confusion. I believe the present case affords occasion for appropriate and necessary abandonment of such a test, particularly since recent decisions2 have already substantially advanced toward a re-examination of the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity.\n The present controversy illustrates the necessity for further re- examination. New York created the Port Authority with power to engage in activities which that State believed to be essential. Yet, under this test, New York's determination is not final until reviewed in a tax litigation between the government and a single citizen.\n Conceptions of 'essential governmental functions' vary with individual philosophies. Some believe that 'essential governmental functions' include ownership and operation of water plants, power and transportation systems, etc. Others deny that such ownership and operation could ever be 'essential governmental functions' on the ground that such functions 'could be carried on by private enterprise.' A Federal income tax levied against the manager of the state-operated elevated railway company of Boston was sustained even though this manager was a public officer appointed by the Governor of Massachusetts 'with the advice and consent of the council.' \n3\n On the other hand, the Federal government was denied- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 405, 427]\n\u00a0\n although with strong dissent-the right to collect an income tax from the chief engineer in charge of New York City's municipally owned water supply. 4 An implied constitutional distinction which taxes income of an officer of a state-operated transportation system and exempts income of the manager of a municipal water works system manifests the uncertainty created by the 'essential' and 'non-essential' test.\n There is not, and there cannot be, any unchanging line of demarcation between essential and nonessential governmental functions. Many governmental functions of today have at some time in the past been nongovernmental. The genius of our government provides that, within the sphere of constitutional action, the people-acting not through the courts but through their elected legislative representatives-have the power to determine as conditions demand, what services and functions the public welfare requires.\n Surely, the Constitution contains no imperative mandate that public employees-or others-drawing equal salaries (income) should be divided into taxpaying and nontaxpaying groups. Ordinarily such a result is discrimination. Uniform taxation upon those equally able to bear their fair shares of the burdens of government is the objective of every just government. The language of the U.S.C.A.Const. Sixteenth Amendment empowering Congress to 'collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived'-given its most obvious meaning-is broad enough to accomplish this purpose.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n So fa a  concerns liability for federal income tax, the salaries paid by the Port Authority to its officers and employees are not distinguishable from salaries paid by \n\n[304 \nU.S. 405, 428]\n\u00a0\n States to their officers and employees. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should therefore be affirmed on the principle applied in McCulloch v. Maryland, 1819, 4 Wheat. 316, that under the Constitution States are without power to tax instrumentalities of the United States and in Collector v. Day, 1871, 11 Wall. 113, that the United States is without power to tax the salary of a state officer. That principle has been followed in a long line of decisions. In Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States, 1931, \n283 \nU.S. 570\n, 51 S.Ct. 601, we held the United States without power to tax the sale of a motorcycle to a municipal corporation for use in its police service. The Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Van Devanter, said (page 575, 51 S.Ct. page 602):\n'It is an established principle of our constitutional system of dual government that the instrumentalities, means and operations whereby the United States exercises its governmental powers are exempt from taxation by the states, and that the instrumentalities, means and operations whereby the states exert the governmental powers belonging to them are equally exempt from taxation by the United States. This principle is implied from the independence of the national and state governments within their respective spheres and from the provisions of the Constitution which look to the maintenance of the dual system. Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 125, 127; Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216, 224\n, 225 S., 51 S.Ct. 125, 126 (71 A.L.R. 1260). Where the principle applies it is not affected by the amount of the particular tax or the extent of the resulting interference, but is absolute. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 430; United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 17 Wall. 322, 327; Johnson v. Maryland, \n254 \nU.S. 51\n, 55-56, 41 S.Ct. 16; Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501, 505\n, 42 S.Ct. 171, 172; Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 44-46.'\n\n Following that case, we recently applied the principle in N.Y. ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, January 4, 1937, 299 \n\n[304 \nU.S. 405, 429]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 401, 57 S.Ct. 269, to prevent the State of New York from taxing the salary of counsel of the Panama Railway Company, a federal instrumentality, and in Brush v. Commissioner, March 15, 1937, \n300 \nU.S. 352\n, 57 S.Ct. 495, 108 A.L.R. 1428, to prevent the United States from taxing the salary of the chief engineer of the bureau of water supply for the city of New York. In Helvering v. Therrell, February 28, 1938, \n303 \nU.S. 218\n, 58 S.Ct. 539, holding that the federal government has power to tax compensation paid to attorneys and others out of corporate assets for necessary services rendered about the liquidation of insolvent corporations by state officers proceeding under her statutes, we said (page 542):\n'Among the inferences which derive necessarily from the Constitution are these: No state may tax appropriate means which the United States may employ for exercising their delegated powers; the United States may not tax instrumentalities which a state may employ in the discharge of her essential governmental duties-that is those duties which the framers intended each member of the union would assume in order adequately to function under the form of government guaranteed by the Constitution.'\n\n The Court, seemingly admitting that it would be futile to attempt to distinguish the cases now before us from the Brush Case, overrules it by declaring that it must be limited by what is now decided. The Solicitor General did not in any manner raise the point on which the Court puts this decision. He sought reversal on the grounds that the Port Authority's activities are proprietary in nature; that it is not an agency created by the States alone; that it operates in nt erstate commerce subject to the paramount power of Congress. Indeed, he expressly disclaimed intention to ask re-examination of the doctrine of immunity on which the Brush Case rests. In substance, as well as in the language used, the decision just announced substitutes for that doctrine the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 405, 430]\n\u00a0\n proposition that, although the federal tax may increase cost of state governments, it may be imposed if it does not curtail functions essential to their existence. Expressly or sub silentio, it overrules a century of precedents. Cf. James v. Dravo Contracting Co., December 6, 1937, \n302 \nU.S. 134, 152\n, 161 S., 58 S.Ct. 208, 217, 221, 114 A.L.R. 318; Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corporation, March 7, 1938, \n303 \nU.S. 376\n, 58 S.Ct. 623, 628, 629. As they stood when the cases now before us were in the Circuit Court of Appeals, our decisions required it to hold that the salaries paid by the Port Authority to respondents are not subject to federal taxation. I would affirm its judgments.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied 59 S.Ct. 57, 83 L.Ed. --.[ Helvering v. Gerhardt \n304 \nU.S. 405\n (1938) ] \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It follows that in considering the immunity of federal instrumentalities from state taxation two factors may be of importance which are lacking in the case of a claimed immunity of state instrumentalities from federal taxation. Since the acts of Congress within its constitutional power are supreme, the validity of state taxation of federal instrumentalities must depend (a) on the power of Congress to create the instrumentality and (b) its intent to protect it from state taxation. Congress may curtail an immunity which might otherwise be implied. Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573, or enlarge it beyond the point where, Congress being silent, the Court would set its limits. New York ex rel. Bank of New York v. Supervisors, 7 Wall. 26, 30, 31; see Thomson v. Union Pacific Railroad, 9 Wall. 579, 588, 590; Shaw v.

L.R. 318.\n The analysis is comparable where the question is whether federal corporate instrumentalities are immune from state judicial process. Federal Land Bank v. Priddy, \n295 \nU.S. 229, 234\n, 235 S., 55 S.Ct. 705, 707, 708. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'The people of all the States have created the general governen t, and have conferred upon it the general power of taxation. The people of all the States, and the States themselves, are represented in Congress, and, by their representatives, exercise this power. When they tax the chartered institutions of the States, they tax their constituents; and these taxes must be uniform. But, when a State taxes the operations of the government of the United States, it acts upon institutions created, not by their own constituents, but by people over whom they claim no control. It acts upon the measures of a government created by others as well as themselves, for the benefit of others in common with themselves. The difference is that which always exists, and always must exist, between the action of the whole on a part, and the action of a part on the whole- between the laws of a government declared to be supreme, and those of a government which, when in opposition to those laws, is not supreme.' Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 435, 436. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In these cases, and particularly in Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, as in McCulloch v. Maryland, emphasis was laid on the fact that by state action an impediment was laid upon the exercise of a power with respect to which the national government was supreme. In Weston v. Charleston, supra, Chief Justice Marshall said (pages 465, 466):\n'Can anything be more dangerous, or more injurious, than the admission of a principle, which authorizes every state and every corporation in the Union which possesses the right of taxation, to burden the exercise of this power (the borrowing power), at their discretion?\n\n'If the right to impose the tax exists, it is a right which in its nature acknowledges no limits. It may be carried to any extent, within the jurisdiction of the state or corporation which imposes it, which the will of each state and corporation may prescribe. A power which is given by the whole American people, for their common good, which is to be exercised, at the most critical periods, for the most important purposes, on the free exercise of which the interests, certainly, perhaps, the liberty of the whole, may depend; may be burdened, impeded, if not arrested, by any of the organized parts of the confederacy.' Compare Holmes, J., in Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, \n277 \nU.S. 218, 223\n, 48 S.Ct. 451, 453, 56 A.L.R. 583. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In 1871, when Collector v. Day was decided, the Court had not yet been called on to determine how far the Civil War Amendments had broadened the federal power at the expense of the states. The Slaughterhouse Cases, 16 Wall. 36, had not yet been decided, although they had already been once before the Court on motion for supersedeas, 10 Wall. 273. The fact that the taxing power had recently been used with destructive effect upon a state instrumentality, Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, had suggested the possibility of similar attacks upon the existence of states themselves. Compare Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76, 77; Slaughterhouse Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 82. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Compare notes 1 and 2, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The following classes of taxpayers have been held subject to federal income tax notwithstanding its possible economic burden on the state: Those who derive income or profits from their performance of state functions as independent engineering contractors, Metcalf & Eddy v.

Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216\n, 51 S.Ct. 125, 71 A.L.R. 1260; those engaged as lessees of the state in producing oil from state lands, the royalties from which, payable to the state, are devoted to public purposes, Group No. 1 Oil Corporation v.

MITCHELL(1938)\nNo. 324\nArgued: January 14, 1938Decided: March 7, 1938\n\n\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 391, 392]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Edward S. Greenbaum, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. William Wallace, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 391, 395]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852,  293, 45 Stat. 791, 858, 26 U.S.C.A.  293 and note provides, in dealing with assessment of deficiencies in income tax returns: '(b) Fraud. If any part of any deficiency is due to fraud with intent to evade tax, then 50 per centum of the total amount of the deficiency (in addition to such deficiency) shall be so assessed, collected, and paid.'\n The question for decision is whether assessment of the addition is barred by the acquittal of the defendant on an indictment under section 146(b) of the same act 26 U.S.C.A.  145(b) and note, for a willful attempt to evade and defeat the tax.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue found that Charles E. Mitchell of New York had, in his income tax return for the year 1929, fraudulently deducted from admitted gross income an alleged loss of $2,872,305.50 from a purported sale of 18,300 shares of National City Bank stock to his wife; that he had fraudulently failed to return the sum of $666,666.67 received by him as a distribution from the management fund of the National City Company, of which he was chairman; and that these fraudulent acts were done with intent to evade the tax. On December 8, 1933, the Commissioner notified Mitchell that there was a deficiency in his tax return of $728, 709.84 and, on account of the fraud, a 50 per cent. addition thereto in the sum of $364,354.92.\n Mitchell appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals, which sustained the Commissioner's determination. Mitchell v. Com'r, 32 B.T.A. 1093. Upon a petition for review, the Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that there was ample evidence to support the Board's findings that Mitchell had fraudulently made deduction of the loss and that he had fraudulently failed to return the amount received from the management fund; and that, despite the facts hereafter stated, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 391, 396]\n\u00a0\n the Board was free to find the facts according to the evidence. It accordingly affirmed the assessment of the deficiency of $728,709.84; but it reversed the Board's approval of the additional assessment of $364,354. 92, because of the following facts:\n Before the deficiency assessment was made Mitchell had been indicted in the federal court for Southern New York under section 146(b) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A.  145(b), which provides: 'Any person ... who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.'\n The first count charged that Mitchell 'unlawfully, willfully, knowingly, feloniously, and fraudulently did attempt to defeat and evade an income tax of, to wit, $728,709.84, upon his net income for 1929.' He was tried on the indictment and acquitted on all the counts. The item of $ 728,709.84 set out in the first count is the same item as that involved in the deficiency assessed; and both arose from the same transactions of Mitchell. But the addition of $364,354.92 by reason of fraud was not involved in the indictment.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the prior judgment of acquittal was not a bar under the doctrine of res judicata; and hence it affirmed the assessment of the $728,709.84. But it held that our decisions in Coffey v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 436\n, 6 S.Ct. 437, and United States v. La Franca, \n282 \nU.S. 568\n, 51 S.Ct. 278, required it 'to treat the imposition of the penalty of 50 percent. as barred by the prior acquittal of Mitchell in the criminal action.' Mitchell v. Com'r, 2 Cir., 89 F.2d 873, 878. Mitchell's petition for certiorari to review so much of the judgment as upheld the assessment of the de- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 391, 397]\n\u00a0\n ficiency of $728,709.84 was denied. \n302 \nU.S. 723\n, 58 S.Ct. 43, 82 L.Ed. --. The Commissioner's petition to review so much of the judgment as denied the 50 per centum in addition was granted, because of the importance in the administration of the revenue laws of the questions presented and alleged conflict in decisions. \n302 \nU.S. 670\n, 58 S.Ct. 46, 82 L.Ed. --.\n First. Mitchell contends that the claim for the 50 per cent. is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. He asserts that all the facts and intents requisite to the imposition of the 50 per centum addition to the deficiency were put in issue and determined against the Government in the criminal trial, and that hence, under the doctrine of res judicata, the judgment of acquittal bars it from obtaining a second judgment based upon the same facts and intents. Since this proceeding to determine whether the amount claimed is payable as a tax is a proceeding different in its nature from the indictment for the crime of willfully attempting to evade the tax, the contention that the doctrine of estoppel by judgment applies rests wholly on the assertion that the issues here presented were litigated and determined in the criminal proceeding. Compare Tait v. Western Maryland Ry. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 620, 623\n, 53 S.Ct. 706, 707. But this is not true.\n The difference in degree of the burden of proof in criminal and civil cases precludes application of the doctrine of res judicata. The acquittal was 'merely ... an adjudication that the proof was not sufficient to overcome all reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.' Lewis v. Frick, \n233 \nU.S. 291, 302\n, 34 S.Ct. 488, 492. It did not determine that Mitchell had not willfully attempted to evade the tax. That acquittal on a criminal charge is not a bar to a civil action by the Government, remedial in its nature, arising out of the same facts on which the criminal proceeding was based has long been settled. Stone v. United States, \n167 \nU.S. 178, 188\n, 17 S.Ct. 778; Murphy v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 630, 631\n, 632 S., 47 S.Ct. 218. Compare Chantangco v. Abaroa, 218 U.S. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 391, 398]\n\u00a0\n 476, 481, 482, 31 S.Ct. 34.1 Where the objective of the subsequent action likewise is punishment, the acquittal is a bar, because to entertain the second proceeding for punishment would subject the defendant to double jeopardy; and double jeopardy is precluded by the Fifth Amendment whether the verdict was an acquittal or a conviction. Murphy v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 630, 632\n, 47 S.Ct. 218.\n The Government urges that application of the doctrine of res judicata is precluded also by the difference in the issues presented in the two cases; that although the indictment and this proceeding arise out of the same transactions and facts, the issues in them are not the same; that on the indictment the issue was whether Mitchell had 'willfully' attempted to 'evade or defeat' the tax; that whether he had done so 'fraudulently' was not there an issue, United States v. Scharton, \n285 \nU.S. 518\n, 52 S.Ct. 416; compare United States v. Murdock, \n290 \nU.S. 389, 397\n, 54 S.Ct. 223, 226; and that in this proceeding the issue is specifically whether the deficiency was 'due to fraud.' Compare Burton v. United States, \n202 \nU.S. 344, 380\n, 26 S.Ct. 688, 6 Ann.Cas. 362. Since there was not even an adjudication that Mitchell did not willfully attempt to evade or defeat the tax, it is not necessary to decide whether such an adjudication would be decisive also of this issue of fraud. Compare Hanby v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 67 F.2d 125, 129.\n Second. Mitchell contends that this proceeding is barred under the doctrine of double jeopardy because the 50 per centum addition of $364,354. 92 is not a tax, but a criminal penalty intended as punishment for allegedly fraudulent acts. Unless this sanction was intended as punishment, so that the proceeding is essentially criminal, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 391, 399]\n\u00a0\n the double jeopardy clause provided for the defendant in criminal prosecutions is not applicable.\n\n 1. \nIn assessing income taxes the Government relies primarily upon the disclosure by the taxpayer of the relevant facts. This disclosure it requires him to make in his annual return. To ensure full and honest disclosure, to discourage fraudulent attempts to evade the tax, Congress imposes sanctions. Such sanctions may confessedly be either criminal or civil. As stated in Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, \n214 \nU.S. 320, 339\n, 29 S.Ct. 671, 676: 'In accord with this settled judicial construction the legislation of Congress from the beginning, not only as to tariff, but as to internal revenue, taxation, and other subjects, has proceeded on the conception that it was within the competency of Congress, when legislating as to matters exclusively within its control, to impose appropriate obligations, and sanction their enforcement by reasonable money penalties, giving to executive officers the power to enforce such penalties without the necessity of invoking the judicial power.'\n Congress may impose both a criminal and a civil sanction in respect to the same act or omission; for the double jeopardy clause prohibits merely punishing twice, or attempting a second time to punish criminally, for the same offense. The question for decision is thus whether section 293(b) imposes a criminal sanction. That question is one of statutory construction. Compare Murphy v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 630, 632\n, 47 S.Ct. 218.\n Remedial sanctions may be of varying types. One which is characteristically free of the punitive criminal element is revocation of a privilege voluntarily granted. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 391, 400]\n\u00a0\n Forfeiture of goods or their value and the payment of fixed or variable sums of money are other sanctions which have been recognized as enforceable by civil proceedings since the original revenue law of 1789. Act of July 31, 1789, c. 5,  36, 1 Stat. 29, 47. In spite of their comparative severity, such sanctions have been upheld against the contention that they are essentially criminal and subject to the procedural rules governing criminal prosecutions. Passavant v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 214\n, 13 S.Ct. 572; United States v. Zucker, \n161 \nU.S. 475\n, 16 S.Ct. 641; Hepner v. United States, \n213 \nU.S. 103\n, 29 S.Ct. 474, 27 L.R.A.,N.S., 739, 16 Ann.Cas. 960; Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, \n214 \nU.S. 320\n, 29 S.Ct. 671; Chicago, B. & Q. Ry. Co. v.

The remedial character of sanctions imposing additions to a tax has been made clear by this Court in passing upon similar legislation. They are provided primarily as a safeguard for the protection of the revenue and to reimburse the Government for the heavy expense of investigation and the loss resulting from the taxpayer's fraud. \n4\n In Stockwell v. United States, 13 Wall. 531, 547, 551, the Court said of a provision which added double the value of the goods:\n'It must therefore be considered as remedial, as providing indemnity for loss. And it is not the less so because the liability of the wrongdoer is measured by double the value of the goods received, concealed, or purchased, instead of their single value. The act of abstracting goods illegally imported, receiving, concealing, or buying them, interposes difficulties in the way of a government seizure, and impairs, therefore, the value of the government right. It is, then, hardly accurate to say that the only loss the government can sustain from concealing the goods liable to seizure is their single value, or to assert that the liability imposed by the statute of double the value is arbitrary and without reference to indemnification. Double the value may not be more than complete indemnity. ...\n\n'The act of 1823 was, as we have seen, remedial in its nature. Its purpose was to secure full compensation for interference with the rights of the United States.'5\n\n\n 3. \nIn sections 276 and 293, 26 U.S.C.A.  276, 293 and notes, it is provided that collection of the 50 per centum addition, like that of the primary tax it- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 391, 402]\n\u00a0\n self, may be made 'by distraint' as well as 'by a proceeding in court.' If the section provided a criminal sanction, the provision for collection by distraint would make it unconstitutional. \n6\n Compare Lipke v. Lederer, \n259 \nU.S. 557\n, 42 S.Ct. 549; Regal Drug Corporation v. Wardell, \n260 \nU.S. 386\n, 43 S.Ct. 152. See, also, United States v. Chouteau, \n102 \nU.S. 603\n, 611; Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n, 6 S.Ct. 524; Lees v. United States, \n150 \nU.S. 476\n, 14 S. Ct. 163; United States v. La Franca, \n282 \nU.S. 568\n, 51 S.Ct. 278. That Congress provided a distinctly civil procedure for the collection of the additional 50 per centum indicates clearly that it intended a civil, not a criminal, sanction. Civil procedure is incompatible with the accepted rules and constitutional guaranties governing the trial of criminal prosecutions, and where civil procedure is prescribed for the enforcement of remedial sanctions, those rules and guaranties do not apply. Thus the determination of the facts upon which liability is based may be by an administrative agency instead of a jury,7 or if the prescribed proceeding is in the form of a civil suit, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 391, 403]\n\u00a0\n a verdict may be directed against the defendant;8 there is no burden upon the Government to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt,9 and it may appeal from an adverse decision;10 furthermore, the defendant has no constitutional right to be confronted with the witnesses \n\n[303 \nU.S. 391, 404]\n\u00a0\n against him,11 or to refuse to testify;12 and finally, in the civil enforcement of a remedial sanction there can be no double jeopardy. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n\n 4. \nThe fact that the Revenue Act of 1928 contains two separate and distinct provisions imposing sanctions, and that these appear in different parts of the statute, helps to make clear the character of that here invoked. \n14\n The sanction of fine and imprisonment prescribed by section 146( b) for willful attempts 'in any manner to evade or de- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 391, 405]\n\u00a0\n feat any (income) tax,' introduced into the act under the heading 'Penalties,' is obviously a criminal one. The sanction of 50 per centum addition 'if any part of any deficiency is due to fraud with intent to evade tax,' prescribed by section 293(b), introduced into the act under the heading 'Additions to the tax,' was clearly intended as a civil one. This sanction, and other additions to the tax are set forth in Supplement M, entitled 'Interest and Additions to the Tax.' The supplement includes, besides section 293(b), sections 291, 292, 293(a), and 294, 26 U.S.C.A.  291, 292, 293(a), 294 and notes. Section 291 prescribes a 25 per centum addition for failure to make and file a return; section 292 prescribes interest at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum upon the deficiency from the date prescribed for payment of the tax; section 293(a), an addition of 5 per centum if the deficiency 'is due to negligence, or intentional disregard of rules and regulations but without intent to defraud'; and section 294 prescribes an addition to the tax of 1 per centum per month in case of nonpayment. Obviously all of these 'additions to the Tax' were intended by Congress as civil incidents of the assessment and collection of the income tax. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n Third. Mitchell insists that Coffey v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 436\n, 6 S.Ct. 437, requires affirmance of the judgment; the Government argues that this case is distinguishable, and, if not, that it should be disapproved. The Circuit Court of Appeals, citing Stone v. United States, \n167 \nU.S. 178\n, 186-189, 17 S.Ct. 778, and later cases, recognized that the rule of the Coffey Case 'did not apply to a situation where there had been an acquittal upon a criminal charge followed by a civil action requiring a different degree of proof'; but \n\n[303 \nU.S. 391, 406]\n\u00a0\n construing section 293(b) as imposing a penalty designed to punish fraudulent tax dodgers 'and not as a mere preventive measure,' it thought that the Coffey Case and United States v. La Franca, \n282 \nU.S. 568\n, 51 S.Ct. 278, required it 'to treat the imposition of the penalty of 50 per cent. as barred by the prior acquittal of Mitchell in the criminal action.' Since we construe section 293(b) as imposing a civil administrative sanction, neither case presents an obstacle to the recovery of the $364,354.92, the 50 per centum addition here in issue.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States v.

The distinction here taken between sanctions that are remedial and those that are punitive has not generally been specifically enunciated. In determining whether particular rules of criminal procedure are applicable to civil actions to enforce sanctions, the cases have usually attempted to distinguish between the type of procedural rule involved rather than the kind of sanction being enforced. Thus Hepner v. United States, \n213 \nU.S. 103, 111\n, 112 S., 29 S.Ct. 474, 27 L.R.A.,N.S., 739, 16 Ann.Cas. 960, holding that a verdict may be directed for the Government, and United States v. Regan, \n232 \nU.S. 37, 50\n, 34 S.Ct. 213, holding that the Government need not prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, distinguished Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n, 6 S.Ct. 524, and Lees v. United States, \n150 \nU.S. 476\n, 14 S.Ct. 163, holding that the defendant could not be required to be a witness against himself, on the ground that 'the guaranty in the 5th Amendment to the Constitution against compulsory self- incrimination ... is of broader scope than are the guaranties in article 3 and the 6th Amendment governing trials in criminal prosecutions.'

Claflin, \n97 \nU.S. 546, 552\n, 553 S.. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Even though Congress may not provide civil procedure for the enforcement of punitive sanctions, nothing in the Constitution prevents the enforcement of distinctly remedial sanctions by a criminal instead of a civil form of proceeding. Compare United States v. Stevenson, \n215 \nU.S. 190\n, 30 S.Ct. 35, with United States v. Regan, \n232 \nU.S. 37\n, 34 S.Ct. 213, both enforcing the sanction prescribed in 34 Stat. 898. The fact that a criminal procedure is prescribed for the enforcement of a sanction may be an indication that it is intended to be punitive, but cannot be deemed conclusive if alternative enforcement by a civil proceeding is sustained. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Passavant v.

Roberts, of Denver, Colo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, Mountain Producers Corporation, owned all the capital stock of the Wyoming Associated Oil Corporation and filed a consolidated income tax return for the year 1925. Two distinct questions are involved with respect to the taxable income of the above-mentioned affiliate. These are (1) as to the amount of the gross income of the affiliate for the purpose of the statutory allowance for depletion in the case of oil and gas wells (Revenue Act 1926,  204(c)(2), 234(a)(8), 44 Stat. 14, 41; and ( 2) as to a claim of exemption from taxation of income received by the affiliate under a trust agreement with the owner of an oil and gas lease from the State of Wyoming. The Board of Tax Appeals decided against respondent upon both points (34 B.T.A. 409) and its decision was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 10 Cir., 92 F.2d 78. Because of an asserted conflict with a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the case of Bankline Oil Company v. Commissioner, 90 F.2d 899 (see Helvering v. Bankline Oil Company, \n303 \nU.S. 362\n, 58 S.Ct. 616, decided this day), we granted certiorari. \n302 \nU.S. 681\n, 58 S.Ct. 409, 82 L.Ed. --.\n First.-Wyoming Associated, organized in 1919, held certain placer mining claims, leases and operating agreements in the Salt Creek Oil Field in Natrona County, Wyo. Pursuant to the Oil and Gas Leasing Act of Congress of February 25, 1920, 41 Stat. 437, the company exchanged its placer claims for government leases and later certain \n\n[303 \nU.S. 376, 379]\n\u00a0\n exchanges were made with the Midwest Oil Company and the Wyoming Oil Fields Company. In 1923, Wyoming Associated made a contract with the Midwest Refining Company by which the former agreed to sell to the latter all the oil produced by it in the Salt Creek Oil Field and the Refining Company agreed to purchase such oil until January, 1934, upon a sliding scale of prices based upon the average price received by the Refining Company for gasoline and kerosene. Wyoming Associated agreed to give the Refining Company free use of all storage facilities, pipe lines, buildings and equipment, and so much of the oil and gas produced as might be reasonably necessary for production pruposes. The Refining Company agreed, as part of the price of the oil thus purchased, to drill, case and maintain all wells, supply water, install and operate pumps, and conduct all development and production operations. The Refining Company agreed to take delivery of the purchased oil at the outlet gates of the measuring tanks located at or near the wells.\n Respondent contended that the gross income of Wyoming Associated from its properties during the taxable year, for the purpose of the statutory allowance for depletion, consisted of the total cash payments received by Wyoming Associated, plus the cost of production defrayed by the Refining Company under its contract. The amount of that cost was shown by stipulation. The Board of Tax Appeals limited the gross income of Wyoming Associated to the cash payments received. The Circuit Court of Appeals was of the opinion that the cost of production incurred by the Refining Company should be added in the view that, had Wyoming Associated produced the oil at its own expense, its gross income would have been the amount which it received for the oil sold and it would thus have obtained in cash the proportionate amount which represented the cost of the production. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 376, 380]\n\u00a0\n Laying emphasis upon the provision of the contract that the Refining Company should perform its services as a part of the purchase price of the oil, respondent contends that it is irrelevant that the Refining Company acted for its own benefit; that the production and lifting services were performed prior to delivery of the oil, and that the Refining Company was acting as the agent for Wyoming Associated down to the point of delivery and not until then became a vendee; that thus Wyoming Associated did not sell oil under the ground but oil severed from the ground and treated for delivery; that it was not essential for respondent to show that the total price under the contract must be either above or below the market price at any specified time, and that the price as fixed by the contract controlled the dealings and the taxes of the parties. Respondent agrees that an interest in oil or gas or some type of ownership is essential to the right of deduction for depletion and assumes that no one but Wyoming Associated owned any interest in the oil and gas in place.\n The government argues that the cash price received for the oil is the seller's entire 'gross income from the property' where, as in this instance, the oil is purchased under a contract by which a refiner agrees to defray the expense of the development and production operations and to pay a cash price based on the prices it obtains for the products it sells at its refinery; that the oil production operations were conducted by the Refining Company for its own benefit in order to obtain the oil at a price it deemed to be favorable; that the method of determining the purchase price under the contract was not related to the field market price of oil but was expressly related to a different basis, which might be greater, that is, to a basis consisting of the current prices obtained by the Refining Company for its gasoline and kerosene; that, if the development operations had been unsuccess- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 376, 381]\n\u00a0\n ful and no oil had been produced, the services of the Refining Company would still have been paid for by the owner's promise to sell at a fixed price whatever oil might be produced, and that this should be taken to be the meaning of the provision that the Refining Company should perform its services as part of the price for oil purchased; that the owner of oil in place, instead of preparing it for delivery and sale, may prefer to lessen his work, lower his price and thus decrease his gross income from the property and in such case the services which the buyer may perform are not to be regarded as part of that income.\n We think that the government's argument is sound. The evident purpose of the statutory provision controls. It is a unique provision to meet a special case. Analogies sought to be drawn from other applications of the revenue acts may be delusive and lead us far from the intent of Congress in this instance. Congress has recognized that in fairness there should be compensation to the owner for the exhaustion of the mineral deposits in the course of production. United States v. Ludey, \n274 \nU.S. 295, 302\n, 47 S. Ct. 608, 610. But to appraise the actual extent of depletion on the particular facts in relation to each taxpayer would give rise to problems of considerable perplexity and would create administrative difficulties which it was intended to overcome by laying down a simple rule which could be easily applied. To this end, the taxpayer was permitted to deduct a specified percentage of his gross income from the property. See United States v. Dakota-Montana Oil Company, \n288 \nU.S. 459, 461\n, 53 S.Ct. 435, 436. Congress was free to give such an arbitrary allowance as the deduction was an act of grace. In answer to the contention that the provision may produce 'unjust and unequal results,' we have remarked that this is likely to be so 'wherever a rule of thumb is applied without a detailed examination of the facts affecting each taxpayer.' Helvering v. Twin Bell Syndicate, \n293 \nU.S. 312, 321\n, 55 S.Ct. 174, 178. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 376, 382]\n\u00a0\n The rule being of this sort for obvious purposes of administrative convenience, we must apply it in the simple manner it contemplates. The 27 1\/2 per cent. allowed is a fixed factor, not to be increased or lessened by asserted equities. The term 'gross income from the property' means gross income from the oil and gas (Helvering v. Twin Bell Syndicate, supra) and the term should be taken in its natural sense. With the motives which lead the taxpayer to be satisfied with the proceeds he receives we are not concerned. If, in this instance, the development operations had failed to produce oil, it would hardly be said that the expense of drilling, borne under contract by another, constituted 'gross income' of the taxpayer within the meaning of the statute. Nor, when oil or gas is produced, does the statute base the percentage on market value. The gross income from time to time may be more or less than market value according to the bearing of particular contracts. We do not think that we are at liberty to construct a theoretical gross income by recourse to the expenses of production operations. The Refining Company for its own purposes undertook the expense of those operations, and Wyoming Associated was content to receive as its own return the cash payments for the oil produced, leaving to the Refining Company the risks of production.\n We are of the opinion that the cash payments made by the Refining Company constituted the gross income of Wyoming Associated and was the basis for the computation of the depletion allowance.\n Second.-The State of Wyoming, in 1919, made a lease for the term of five years to the Midwest Oil Company covering a section of 'school land' ( section 36, township 40 north, range 79 west) for the purpose of producing oil and gas, reserving a royalty to the State. The lease was superseded in 1923 by another lease of like import, running from 1924, the royalty to the state being fixed at 65 per cent. of oil and gas produced. In \n\n[303 \nU.S. 376, 383]\n\u00a0\n 1923, the Midwest Oil Company executed a declaration of trust, that it held an undivided 50 per cent. interest in the lease, and in the net proceeds to be realized therefrom, and all renewals thereof, for the benefit of Wyoming Associated. In 1925, the State received the agreed royalty of the oil produced and the proceeds of the sale of the remaining oil were divided between Wyoming Associated and the Midwest Oil Company.\n The question is whether Wyoming Associated is subject to a federal income tax with respect to the amount it thus received. Immunity is claimed upon the ground that in this relation Wyoming Associated is a state instrumentality.\n By the Enabling Act, the land in question was granted to the State of Wyoming for educational purposes, the proceeds to constitute a permanent school fund. Authority was given to lease such land for not more than five years. Act July 10, 1890, c. 664,  4, 5, 26 Stat. 222, 223. Apart from the fact that the claim is made by Wyoming Associated by virtue of the declaration of trust and not by the lessee, the case would fall directly within the decision in Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., \n285 \nU.S. 393\n, 52 S.Ct. 443, relating to a federal tax upon net income derived by a lessee under a lease of 'school lands' by the State of Oklahoma. In Burnet v. A. T. Jergins Trust, \n288 \nU.S. 508\n, 53 S.Ct. 439, we limited the application of the Coronado Case, saying that the doctrine invoked was to be applied strictly. But a distinction solely upon the ground that the income in the instant case was received under a declaration of trust by the lessee, and not by the lessee itself, does not appear to be substantial and we are of the opinion that the Cororado Case and the decision upon which it rested should be reconsidered in the light of our other decisions as to the taxing power.\n The Coronado Case was decided as a corollary to the case of Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501\n, 42 S.Ct. 171, 172. The Court there denied to Oklahoma the right to enforce its tax \n\n[303 \nU.S. 376, 384]\n\u00a0\n upon net income derived by a lessee from sales of his share of oil and gas received under leases of restricted Indian lands. See Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf R.R. Co. v. Harrison, \n235 \nU.S. 292\n, 35 S.Ct. 27; Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, \n240 \nU.S. 522\n, 36 S.Ct. 453. As Oklahoma was thus barred from enforcing its tax upon the income of a federal lessee of Indian lands, the Court in the Coronado Case held that a similar principle should be applied to the enforcement of a federal tax upon the income of the state's lessee of school lands. In such a case, as the state was executing a trust imposed by Congress as a condition of the state's entering the Union, the cases in which the state had engaged in business enterprises, apart from what should be deemed to be its essential governmental functions, were thought to be inapplicable. \n285 \nU.S. 393\n, at page 400, 52 S.Ct. 443.\n The ground of the decision in the Gillespie Case, as stated by Mr. Justice Holmes in speaking for the Court, was that 'a tax upon the leases' was \"a tax upon the power to make them, and could be used to destroy the power to make them,' \n240 \nU.S. 522\n, at page 530, 36 S.Ct. 453,' and that a tax 'upon the profits of the leases' was 'a direct hamper upon the effort of the United States to make the best terms that it can for its wards.' In the light of the expanding needs of state and nation, the inquiry has been pressed whether this conclusion has adequate basis; whether in a case where the tax is not laid upon the leases as such, or upon the government's property or interest, but is imposed upon the gains of the lessee, like that laid upon others engaged in similar business enterprises, there is in truth such a direct and substantial interference with the performance of the government's obligation as to require immunity for the lessee's income. We have held that the ruling in the Gillespie Case should be limited strictly to cases closely analogous (Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., supra), and the distinctions \n\n[303 \nU.S. 376, 385]\n\u00a0\n thus maintained have attenuated its teaching and raised grave doubt as to whether it should longer be supported.\n In numerous decisions we have had occasion to declare the competing principle, buttressed by the most cogent considerations, that the power to tax should not be crippled 'by extending the constitutional exemption from taxation to those subjects which fall within the general application of non-discriminatory laws, and where no direct burden is laid upon the governmental instrumentality, and there is only remote, if any, influence upon the exercise of the functions of government.' Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216, 225\n, 51 S.Ct. 125, 127, 71 A.L.R. 1260, and illustrations there cited. Thus we have held that the compensation paid by a state or a municipality to a consulting engineer for work on public projects may be subjected to a federal income tax (Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514, 524\n, 46 S.Ct. 172, 174) and that the income of independent contractors engaged in carrying on government enterprises may be taxed. James v. Dravo Contracting Company, \n302 \nU.S. 134\n, 58 S.Ct. 208, decided December 6, 1937. We have always recognized that no constitutional implications prohibit a nondiscriminatory tax upon the property of an agent of government merely because it is the property of such an agent and used in the conduct of the agent's operations and necessary for the agency. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 436; Union P. Railroad Company v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 33; Alward v. Johnson, \n282 \nU.S. 509, 514\n, 51 S.Ct. 273, 75 A.L.R. 9. The Congress may tax state banks upon the average amount of their deposits, although deposits of state funds by state officers are included. Manhattan Company v. Blake, \n148 \nU.S. 412\n, 13 S.Ct. 640. Both the Congress and the States have the power to tax transfers or successions in case of death, and this power extends to the taxation by a state of bequests to the United States and to the taxation by the Congress of bequests to states or their municipalities. United States v. Perkins, \n163 \nU.S. 625\n, 16 S.Ct. 1073; Snyder v. Bettman, \n190 \nU.S. 249, 253\n, 254 S., 23 S.Ct. 803. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 376, 386]\n\u00a0\n While a tax on the interest payable on state and municipal bonds has been held to be invalid as a tax bearing directly upon the exercise of the borrowing power of the government (Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 468, 469; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429, 586\n, 15 S.Ct. 673), the sale of the bonds by their owners after they have been issued by the state or municipality is regarded as a transaction distinct from the contracts made by the government in the bonds themselves, and the profits of such sales are subject to the federal income tax. Willcuts v. Bunn, supra, \n282 \nU.S. 216\n, at page 227, 51 S.Ct. 125, 127, 71 A.L.R. 1260. See, also, Burnet v. A. T. Jergins Trust, supra; Helvering v. Therrell, \n303 \nU.S. 218\n, 58 S.Ct. 539, decided February 28, 1937; and Helvering v. Bankline Oil Company, \n303 \nU.S. 362\n, 58 S.Ct. 616, decided this day.\n In Group No. 1 Oil Corporation v. Bass, \n283 \nU.S. 279\n, 51 S.Ct. 432, profits derived by a lessee from the sale of oil and gas produced under a lease from the State of Texas were held not to be immune from federal taxation. This decision was distinguished in the Coronado Case upon the narrow ground that under the law of Texas the leases effected a present sale to the lessee of the oil and gas in place. In Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Company v. Board, \n288 \nU.S. 325\n, 53 S.Ct. 388, the Court sustained a nondiscriminatory ad valorem tax imposed by the State of Oklahoma on oil extracted from restricted Indian lands under leases approved by the Secretary of the Interior, where the oil had been removed from the lands and stored in the owner's tanks and the Indians had no further interest in it.\n These decisions in a variety of applications enforce what we deem to be the controlling view-that immunity from non-discriminatory taxation sought by a private person for his property or gains because he is engaged in operations under a government contract or lease cannot be supported by merely theoretical conceptions of interference with the functions of government. Regard must be had to substance and direct effects. And, where \n\n[303 \nU.S. 376, 387]\n\u00a0\n it merely appears that one operating under a government contract or lease is subjected to a tax with respect to his profits on the same basis as others who are engaged in similar businesses, there is no sufficient ground for holding that the effect upon the government is other than indirect and remote. We are convinced that the rulings in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra, and Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Company, supra, are out of harmony with correct principle and accordingly they should be, and they now, are, overruled.\n In the instant case, we find no ground for concluding that the tax upon the profits of Wyoming Associated derived under its lease from the state constituted any direct and substantial interference with the execution of the trust which the state has assumed, and the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals to the contrary must be reversed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n At least since M'Culloch v. Maryland, 1819, 4 Wheat. 316, the dual form of government resulting from the adoption of the Constitution has been deemed necessarily to imply that no state may tax the operations of the federal government in the exertion of powers that the people delegated to it and that, for the same reason, the federal government may not tax the operations of any state in the exertion of any of its essential functions of government. As to that principle, the urgency of governmental demand for money does not justify yielding here. No one can foresee the extent to which the decision just announced surrenders it. The transactions of a state \n\n[303 \nU.S. 376, 388]\n\u00a0\n for the purpose of raising money to provide for schools are admittedly within the principle as heretofore it has been understood and applied. Now this Court makes it lawful for the United States to lay tribute upon them.\n A few citations will be sufficient to suggest the character of the change so wrought.\n M'Culloch v. Maryland held that impliedly the Federal Constitution forbade imposition by Maryland of any tax upon the operations of the Bank of the United States within that state. There Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for a unanimous Court, demonstrates (at page 426 of 4 Wheat.): '1st. that a power to create implies a power to preserve: 2d. That a power to destroy, if wielded by a different hand, is hostile to, and incompatible with these powers to create and to preserve: 3d. That where this repugnancy exists, that authority which is supreme must control, not yield to that over which it is supreme.'\n Farmers' & Mechanics' Sav. Bank v. Minnesota, 1914, \n232 \nU.S. 516\n, 34 S.Ct. 354, held that a State cannot tax bonds issued by a territory of the United States; that a tax upon the bonds is a tax on the government issuing them; that such a tax, if allowed at all, may be carried to an extent that will entirely arrest governmental operations. The Court rested that decision upon M'Culloch v. Maryland, saying (at page 521 of 232 U.S., 34 S.Ct. 354, 355): 'The principle has never since been departed from, and has often been reasserted and applied.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Choctaw, O. & Gulf R.R. v. Harrison, 1914, \n235 \nU.S. 292\n, 35 S.Ct. 27, 59, 234, held that, where by agreement with an Indian tribe the United States assumed a duty in regard to operation of coal mines, the lessees of the mines were instrumentalities of the government and could not be subjected to a state occupation or privilege tax. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 376, 389]\n\u00a0\n Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 1916, \n240 \nU.S. 522\n, 36 S.Ct. 453, held that oil leases in Oklahoma made by the Osage Tribe were under the protection of the federal government; that the corporation owning the leases was a federal instrumentality; and that therefore the state could not tax its interest in the leases, either directly or by taxing the capital stock of the corporation owning them. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 1922, \n257 \nU.S. 501\n, 42 S.Ct. 171, held that net income derived from leases like those considered in Choctaw, O. & Gulf R.R. v. Harrison, supra, and Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, supra, could not be taxed by the state; for the lessee was an instrumentality used by the United States in fulfilling its duties to the Indians. \n4\n The Court said (\n257 \nU.S. 501\n, at page 506, 42 S.Ct. 171, 172): 'The same considerations that invalidate a tax upon the leases invalidate a tax upon the profits of the leases, and, stopping short of theoretical possibilities, a tax upon such profits is a direct hamper upon the effort of the United States to make the best terms that it can for its wards.' \n\n[303 \nU.S. 376, 390]\n\u00a0\n Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, 1926, \n271 \nU.S. 609\n, 46 S.Ct. 592, held that where mining land was leased by incompetent Indian owners with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, in consideration of royalty in kind, a state ad valorem tax assessed to lessee on ores in bins on the land, before sale or segregation, was void as an attempt to tax an agency of the Federal Government. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n In Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 1932, \n285 \nU.S. 393\n, 52 S.Ct. 443, it appeared that lands granted by the United States to Oklahoma for the support of common schools were leased by the state to a private company for extraction of oil and gas, the state reserving a part of the gross production, the proceeds of which were paid into the school fund. We held that the lease was an instrumentality of the state in the exercise of a strictly governmental function, and that application of the federal income tax to the income derived from the lease by the lessee was therefore unconstitutional. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n To reach in this case the conclusion that respondent's affiliate is subject to federal income tax on the proceeds of its share of the oil received under the lease of state school lands, this Court expressly overrules Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra, and Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., supra; and with them necessarily goes a long line of decisions of this and other courts. The opinion brings forward no real reason for so sweeping a change of con- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 376, 391]\n\u00a0\n struction of the Constitution. It is to the plain disadvantage of Indian wards of the national government and school children of the several states; it threatens many business arrangements that have been made for their benefit.\n I dissent.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Citing Osborn v.

NATIONAL GROCERY CO.(1938)\nNo. 723\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[304 \nU.S. 282, 283]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James W. Morris, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Webster Atwell, of Dallas Tex., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. D. Carpenter, Jr., of Jersey City, N.J., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n National Grocery Company is a New Jersey corporation, which operates chain stores. Since 1911 it has had $200,000 capital stock, all owned beneficially by Henry Kohl. In the year ending January 31, 1931, the corporation's books showed a net profit of.$682,850.38, after paying $104, 000 to Kohl as salary and the regular federal \n\n[304 \nU.S. 282, 284]\n\u00a0\n corporation income tax of 12 per cent. Its surplus, as shown by its books, increased during the year from $7,245,824.26 to $7,938,965.54; that is $ 693,141.28. It paid no dividend.\n Section 104 of the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 814, 26 U.S. C.A.  104 note, provides:\n'(a) If any corporation, however created or organized, is formed or availed of for the purpose of preventing the imposition of the surtax upon its shareholders through the medium of permitting its gains and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed, there shall be levied, collected, and paid for each taxable year upon the net income of such corporation a tax equal to 50 per centum of the amount thereof, which shall be in addition to the tax imposed by section 13 ....\n\n'(b) The fact ... that the gains or profits are permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the business, shall be prima facie evidence of a purpose to escape the surtax.'\n\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, having found that the corporation had been availed of for the purpose of preventing the imposition of the surtax upon Kohl by permitting the gains and profits to accumulate, assessed upon it, under section 104, a deficiency tax of $477, 322.81 for the tax year, in addition to the regular corporation income tax, which had been paid. This amount, together with $37.87 admittedly due, constitutes the total deficiency assessment of $477,360.68.\n The corporation petitioned for a redetermination by the Board of Tax Appeals. Before the Board a large volume of evidence was introduced which had not been submitted to the Commissioner. It detailed, among other things, the financial history of the business from its inception. There were thirty-five elaborate exhibits, many of them prepared from the books with the co-operation of the counsel for the corporation and for the Commissioner. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 282, 285]\n\u00a0\n Twenty-four of the exhibits were introduced by the taxpayer; eleven by the Commissioner. The taxpayer also presented as witnesses Kohl and the treasurer of the corporation, who testified orally to the history of the business, its practices and aims; local bank officials who testified as experts to the wisdom of accumulating the profits; and other experts who testified to the depreciation in 1930 of the market value of the securities held by the corporation and of its real estate. The Board, by a bare majority,1 sustained the Commissioner's determination. In stating its conclusions, it found as folow s:\n'We find as a fact that the petitioner's accumulation of earnings was far in excess of the 'reasonable needs' of the corporate business.\n\n'We are also of opinion that the evidence of record does not rebut the prima facie presumption created by the statute that the accumulation of earnings beyond the 'reasonable needs of the business' was for the purpose of preventing the imposition of the surtax upon its sole stockholder. ...\n\n'Upon the evidence before us we have made the finding that the petitioner was 'availed of' during the fiscal year ended January 31, 1931, for the purpose of preventing the imposition of the surtax upon its sole stockholder 'through the medium of permitting its gains and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.'\n\n The corporation then petitioned for a review by the Circuit Court of Appeals. It reversed the order of the Board; and did so on the ground that there was before the Board 'no proof, substantial or otherwise, to support its imposition of' the tax (page 935 of 92 F.2d). Certiorari was sought by the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 282, 286]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner, who urged that in so deciding the court had departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings. We granted certiorari because of the importance in the administration of the revenue laws of the matter presented. \n303 \nU.S. 630\n, 58 S.Ct. 645, 82 L.Ed. --.\n The corporation makes here two contentions in support of the judgment which were not discussed by the Court of Appeals. It challenges the constitutionality of the statute and also urges that in holding that there were 'gains and profits' the Commissioner and the Board of Tax Appeals misconstrued the statute. These contentions will be considered before examining the alleged lack of evidence to support the findings of the Board.\n First. The National Grocery Company concedes that section 104 is constitutional as applied to a corporation organized for the purpose of preventing the imposition of surtaxes upon its shareholders;2 but urges five reasons why it should be held void as applied to a legitimate business corporation which is 'availed of' for the forbidden purpose. None of these reasons is sound.\n\n 1. \nIt is said that the statute violates the Tenth Amendment because it interferes with the power to declare or to withhold dividends-a power which the State conferred upon the corporation. The statute in no way limits the powers of the corporation. It merely lays the tax upon corporations which use their powers to prevent imposition upon their stockholders of the federal surtaxes. 'Congress in raising revenue has incidental power to de- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 282, 287]\n\u00a0\n feat obstructions to that incidence of taxes which it chooses to impose.' United Business Corporation v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 62 F.2d 754, 756.\n Kohl's personal income tax for the calendar year 1931 was $32,034.74. If he had included in his personal return of taxable income the corporation's entire net income for the fiscal year 1930-1931, an additional tax upon him of over $115,000 would have been due;3 and no tax would have been assessable against the corporation under section 104. For the statute expressly provides, in paragraph (d), that the corporation shall not be so taxed, if the stockholders make the return required to ensure the surtax: '(d) The tax imposed by this section shall not aply if all the shareholders of the corporation include (at the time of filing their returns) in their gross income their entire distributive shares, whether distributed or not, of the net income of the corporation for such year. Any amount so included in the gross income of a shareholder shall be treated as a dividend received. Any subsequent distribution made by the corporation out of the earnings or profits for such taxable year shall, if distributed to any shareholder who has so included in his gross income his distributive share, be exempt from tax in the amount of the share so included.' \n\n[304 \nU.S. 282, 288]\n\u00a0\n 2. It is said that the statute is unconstitutional because the liability imposed is not a tax upon income, but a penalty designed to force corporations to distribute earnings in order to create a basis for taxation against the stockholders. If the business had been carried on by Kohl individually all the year's profits would have been taxable to him. If, having a partner, the business had been carried on as a partnership, all the year's profits would have been taxable to the partners individually, although these had been retained by the partnership undistributed. See Heiner v. Mellon, \n304 \nU.S. 271\n, 58 S.Ct. 926, 82 L.Ed . --, decided May 16, 1938. Kohl, the sole owner of the business, could not by conducting it as a corporation, prevent Congress, if it chose to do so, from laying on him individually the tax on the year's profits. 4 If it preferred, Congress could lay the tax upon the corporation, as was done by section 104. The penal nature of the imposition does \n\n[304 \nU.S. 282, 289]\n\u00a0\n not prevent its being valid, as the tax was otherwise permissible under the Constitution. Compare Helvering v. Mitchell, \n303 \nU.S. 391\n, 58 S.Ct. 630.\n\n 3. \nIt is said that section 104 is unconstitutional because the liability is laid upon the mere purpose to prevent imposition of the surtaxes, not upon the accomplishment of that purpose; and that, thus, it is a direct tax on the state of mind. But this is not so. The tax is laid 'upon the net income of such corporation.' The existence of the defined purpose is a condition precedent to the imposition of the tax liability, but this does not prevent it from being a true income tax within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment. The instances are many in which purpose or state of mind determines the incidence of an income tax. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n 4. \nIt is said that section 104 as applied deprived the corporation of its property without due process of law; that it is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious in that no stand- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 282, 290]\n\u00a0\n ard or formula is specified to guide the Commissioner in assessing, or the corporate directors in avoiding, the additional tax; that it is assessed retroactively; and that it is unfair to non-assenting minority stockholders. The prescribed standard is not too vague. As Judge Learned Hand said in United Business Corporation v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 62 F.2d 754, 756: 'Standards of conduct, fixed no more definitely, are common in the law; the whole (law) of torts is pervaded by them; much of its commands are that a man must act as the occasion demands, the standard being available to all. The vice of fixing maximum prices is that it requires recourse to standards beyond ascertainment by sellers, by which therefore they cannot in practice regulate their dealings. That is not true of the reasonable needs of a business, which is immediately within the ken of the managers, the supposititious standard, though indeed objective, being as accessible as those for example of the prudent driving of a motor car, or of the diligence required in making a ship seaworthy, or of the extent of proper inquiry into the solvency of a debtor.'\n Clearly retroactive assessment is no more objectionable here than in the case of penalties for fraud or negligence. Helvering v. Mitchell, supra. And since no minority stockholders are here involved, the last objection need not be considered. Del Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 \nU.S. 674, 680\n, 18 S.Ct. 229; Atlantic Refining o. v. Virginia, \n302 \nU.S. 22, 27\n, 58 S.Ct. 75, 77.\n\n 5. \nIt is said that section 104 is void because it delegates to the Commissioner legislative power. The statute provides that if the corporation is availed of for the forbidden purpose, the tax 'shall be levied, collected, and paid'; and certain facts are made prima facie evidence of the existence of this purpose. No power is delegated to the Commissioner save that of finding facts upon evidence.\n Second. The corporation contends, as a matter of statutory construction, that section 104 was not applicable \n\n[304 \nU.S. 282, 291]\n\u00a0\n because there were no 'gains and profits' within the tax year. Conceding that net income of $863,787.22 was earned,6 it asserts that there were 'no gains and profits' because the depreciation in the securities owned, none of which were sold, exceeded $2,000,000. The argument is that the word 'gains' was not used as synonymous with 'profits', but to express contemplated unrealized increases or accession in net worth of the assets; and that assessability under section 104 depends not upon gains or profits- but upon the aggregate of gains (or losses) and profits, since prudent directors would take these into consideration in determining whether a dividend should be declared. Depreciation in any of the assets is evidence to be considered by the Commissioner and the Board in determining the issue of fact whether the accumulation of profits was in excess of the reasonable needs of the business. But obviously depreciation in the market value of securities which the corporation continues to hold does not, as matter of law, preclude a finding that the accumulation of the year's profits was in excess of the reasonable needs of the business.\n Third. There was ample evidence to support the findings of the Board of Tax Appeals. The corporation held on January 31, 1930, bonds and stocks valued at $2,779,718.07; on January 31, 1931 it held $2,989,452.74-an increase of $209,734.67. The list of these bonds and stocks showed that they were in no way related to a grocery business. \n7\n That there was no need of accumu- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 282, 292]\n\u00a0\n lating any part of the year's earnings for the purpose of financing the business was shown by the balance sheet. Comparing the cash on hand with the outstanding indebtedness it appears that the $1,332,332.28 cash on hand January 31, 1930 exceeded the $1,161,121.96 accounts payable, notes and mortgage, by $171,210.32. On January 31, 1931, the excess of cash over accounts payable was $1,136,820.55. These were then only $269,140.49; and the cash on hand was $1,405,961.04. The notes payable and the mortgage had been discharged.\n That the purpose of accumulating this huge surplus was to escape the imposition upon Kohl of surtaxes, was indicated by the following facts. The $4,395,413.78 aggregate of bonds, stocks, and excess cash January 31, 1931, represents about four-fifths of the total accumulation of the surplus profits during the last ten years, which amounted to $5,742,455.35. 8 If the surplus profits of the fiscal year 1930-1931 had been distributed as dividends, the additional surtaxes payable thereon by Kohl in the year 1931 would have been at least $90,744.56, and for the preceding nine years would have aggregated $1,240,852.30.9\n[Table continued next page.] \n\n[304 \nU.S. 282, 293]\n\u00a0\n Further evidence to support the Board's findings that in the tax year dividends were omitted and the surplus accumulated in order to enable Kohl to escape these surtaxes is furnished by the following facts: Kohl drew his salary of $104,000 a year; and that sum, as an expense of the business, was deducted before calculating the corporation's profit on which it paid taxes under section 13 of the act, 26 U.S.C.A.  13 and note. He needed personally further sums and took these in the form of loans. In the tax year Kohl borrowed from the corporation $140,000. His aggregate indebtedness on January 31, 1931 for borrowings during seven years, was $ 610,000. As was stated in United Business Corporation v. Commissioner, supra, 62 F.2d page 755: 'These loans are incompatible with a purpose to strengthen the financial position of the\n TABLE CONTINUED\n Kohl's Computed Net Income Kohl's Surtax Including Computed Actually Distribution Surtax Paid Difference $703,972.52 $132,454.50 $8,022.37 $124,432.13 839,766.18 159,613.24 8,441.14 151,172.10 775,363.34 146,732.67 8,411.75 138,320.92 569,440.88 105,548.18 8,481.21 97,066.97 584,937.44 108,647.49 9,113.16 99,534.33 614,044.69 114,468.94 9,004.24 105,464.70 546,921.87 188,788.75 2,820.60 185,968.15 441,832.16 191,876.09 2,069.50 189,806.59 362,986.22 152,453.11 3,366.70 149,086.41 $1,240,852.30 \n\n[304 \nU.S. 282, 294]\n\u00a0\n petitioner, but entirely accord with a desire to get the equivalent of his dividends under another guise.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Since Kohl was the sole owner of the corporation, the business would have been as well protected against unexpected demands for capital, and assured of capital for the purpose of any possible expansion, by his personal ownership of the securities as by the corporation's owning them. Moreover, no conceivable expansion could have utilized so large a surplus. 11 The high taxes were first imposed in 1919.12 After that time no dividend was paid until after the close of the taxable year here involved.\n Thus, independently of the presumption prescribed in section 104(b) of the act, 26 U.S.C.A.  104 note there was ample evidence to support the Board's findings.\n Fourth. The Court of Appeals, instead of limiting its review to ascertaining whether there was evidence to support the Board's findings and decision, made on all the evidence, as upon a trial de novo, in effect, an independent determination of the matters which had been in issue before the Board. The court was without power to do so. Helvering v. Rankin, \n295 \nU.S. 123, 131\n, 132 S., 55 S.Ct. 732, 736. To draw inferences, to weigh the evidence and to declare the result was the function of the Board. Hulburd v. Commissioner, \n\n[304 \nU.S. 282, 295]\n\u00a0\n \n296 \nU.S. 300, 306\n, 56 S.Ct. 197, 200; Elmhurst Cemetery Co. v. Commissioner, \n300 \nU.S. 37, 40\n, 57 S.Ct. 324, 325.\n Fifth. The court expressed the opinion that the Board failed to consider relevant and controlling facts, that it relied upon improper evidence in reaching its conclusion, and that it failed to make the findings required by the statute. There is nothing in the record to justify that view. The findings quoted above are specific. The Board was not obliged to accept as true Kohl's statement of his intention and purposes; or to accept as sound the opinion of his experts. It was error to reverse the decision of the Board. There is no occasion to remand the case to it for further consideration.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of opinion that the judgment below should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied 59 S.Ct. 56, 83 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Mr. Mellott, who stated the views of the minority, said: 'This being a 'fact case', it is with some reluctance that I reach a conclusion at variance with that of the Member who heard the testimony of the witnesses and had the advantage of observing their manner and demeanor while testifying. ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Citing United Business Corporation v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 62 F.2d 754; A. D. Saenger, Inc., v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 84 F.2d 23; Almours Securities, Inc., v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 91 F.2d 427; Williams Inv. Co. v. United States, Ct.Cl., 3 F.Supp. 225. See, also, United States v. R. C. Tway Coal Co., 6 Cir., 75 F.2d 336; Keck Inv. Co. v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 77 F.2d 244. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] It is not possible to calculate what Kohl's exact additional surtax liability would have been had he included the corporation's income for 1930-1931 in his personal return for 1931, since that return is not in evidence. A minimum figure, however, may be obtained. The corporation's 'net income', as defined in section 104, was $954,645.62. There must be deducted from this $103,654.47 for corporation income tax; and $100,000 was distributed as a dividend in 1931 and included in computing the tax paid by Kohl in that year. Even assuming that the remaining $750,991.15 would have constituted his entire net income for 1931, and that the maximum deduction of 15% of this amount for charitable contributions could have been taken, a surtax of $119,328.50 would have been due. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The first statute which provided for taxation where corporate profits are accumulated for the purpose of preventing the imposition of surtaxes upon stockholders was the Tariff Act of 1913, section 2A, subd. 1, 38 Stat. 166. In that Act, in the Revenue Act of 1916,  3, 39 Stat. 758, and in the Revenue Act of 1918,  220, 40 Stat. 1072, the tax was laid upon the shareholder. In all later Revenue Acts, the tax is laid upon the corporation. 1921 Act,  220, 42 Stat. 247; 1924 Act,  220, 43 Stat. 277; 1926 Act,  220, 44 Stat. 34; 1928 Act,  104, 45 Stat. 814, 26 U.S.C.A.  104 note; 1932 Act,  104, 47 Stat. 195, 26 U.S.C.A.  104 note; 1934 Act ,  102, 48 Stat. 702, 26 U.S.C.A.  104; 1936 Act,  102, 49 Stat. 1676, 26 U.S.C.A.  104 and note.\n The Revenue Acts of 1918 and 1921,  218(e) and 218(d), 40 Stat. 1070, 42 Stat. 245, respectively, also taxed the shareholders of 'personal service corporations' like partners. Section 112(k) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 26 U.S.C.A.  112(i) and note, and section 112(i) of the Acts of 1934 and 1936, 26 U.S.C.A.  112(i), provide for the disregard of the corporate entity in certain cases where foreign corporations are used for the purpose of avoiding federal taxes. And section 201 of the Revenue Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 818, 26 U.S.C.A.  326 et seq., provides that the adjusted undistributed net income of foreign personal holding companies must be included in the gross income of their United States shareholders. Compare also Southern Pac. Co. v. Lowe, \n47 \nU.S. 330, 336\n, 38 S.Ct. 540; Gulf Oil Corporation v. Lewellyn, \n248 \nU.S. 71\n, 39 S.Ct. 35; Gregory v. Helvering, \n293 \nU.S. 465\n, 55 S.Ct. 266, 97 A.L.R. 1355. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] For example, section 293(b) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A .  293(b) and note, provides that if any part of a deficiency is due to 'fraud with intent to evade tax,' there shall be an 'addition to the tax' of 50% of the deficiency. Helvering v. Mitchell, \n303 \nU.S. 391\n, 58 S.Ct. 630. Whether a payment received is compensation within section 22(a) or is a gift within section 22(b)(3), 26 U.S.C.A.  22(a), 22(b)(3) and notes, is largely a matter of intention. Compare Bogardus v. Commissioner, \n302 \nU.S. 34, 45\n, 58 S.Ct. 61, 62. Similarly, the deductibility of losses under section 23(e), 26 U.S.C.A.  23 note, may depend upon whether the taxpayer's motive in entering into the transaction was primarily profit. Compare Heiner v. Tindle, \n276 \nU.S. 582\n, 48 S.Ct. 326; Stuart v. Commissioner, 1 Cir., 84 F.2d 368, 107 A.L.R. 438; Goldsborough v. Burnet, 4 Cir., 46 F.2d 432; Beaumont v. Helvering, 63 App.D.C. 387, 73 F.2d 110, 113; Dresser v. United States, Ct. Cl., 55 F.2d 499. And section 112(k) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 26 U.S.C. A.  112(i) and note, and section 112(i) of the Acts of 1934 and 1936, 26 U.S.C.A.  112(i), provides that a foreign corporation shall not be considered as a corporation for purposes of certain of the non-recognition provisions of that section unless 'it has been established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that such exchange (or distribution) is not in pursuance of a plan having as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of Federal income taxes.' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The corporation reported in its return an income of $863,471.67. This was increased by the Commissioner to $863,787.22, and is not now disputed. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] The stock held January 31, 1931, of the aggregate cost of $2,676, 061.47, consisted of issues of 147 different corporations. Of industrials there were 61. Of public utilities, 27. Of insurance companies, 18. Of investment trusts, 13. Of banks and trust companies, 28. There were, besides, government, municipal, railroad, public utility, industrial and miscellaneous bonds which cost $313,391.27. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The profits for these years (after deducting federal corporation income taxes paid) are listed in note 9, infra. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Kohl's individual returns were made on a calendar year cash basis. For the fisal year here in question, January 31, 1930 to January 31, 1931, the corporation's books showed a profit of.$682,850.38 after deducting Kohl's salary and the 12% corporation income tax paid. A dividend of $100, 000 was paid in 1931. Had the remaining $582,850.38 been entirely distributed in that year, Kohl would have incurred an additional surtax liability of $90,744.56, even if it be assumed that the additional distribution would have constituted his entire net income for that year and that the 15% maximum charitable contributions deduction could have been taken.

O'Donnell, owned one-third of the capital stock of the San Gabriel Petroleum Company. By contract of January 9, 1918, he sold this stock to the Petroleum Midway Company, Limited. As consideration, the Midway Company agreed to pay to respondent one-third of the net profits from the development and operation of the oil and gas properties then owned by the San Gabriel Company and which the Midway Company agreed to acquire. That acquisition was made, the properties thus acquired were developed and operated, and one-third of the net profits thus derived were paid to respondent to August 4, 1926. With respect to such payments in the years 1925 and 1926, respondent claimed deduction for depletion, which the Board of Tax Appeals allowed, overruling the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 32 B.T.A. 1277.

As a mere owner of shares in the San Gabriel Company, respondent had no such interest. Treasury Tegulations No. 69, art. 201. The ownership of the oil and gas properties was in the corporation. When the Midway Company acquired these properties from the San Gabriel Company and operated them, the Midway Company became the owner of the oil and gas produced. It was the owner of the gross proceeds or income upon which the statutory allowance for depletion was to be computed. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 370, 372]\n\u00a0\n Helvering v. Twin Bell Syndicate, supra. The agreement to pay respondent one-third of the net profits derived from the development and operation of the properties was a personal covenant and did not purport to grant respondent an interest in the properties themselves. If there were no net profits, nothing would be payable to him. No trust was declared by which respondent could claim an equitabl interest in the res. As consideration for the sale of his stock in the San Gabriel Company respondent bargained for and obtained an economic advantage from the Midway Company's operations but that advantage or profit did not constitute a depletable interest in the oil and gas in place.

(who,) under the direction and supervision of the Comptroller, shall take possession of the books, records and assets of every description ... and in his name shall sue for and collect all debts, dues and claims belonging to it, and upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction may sell or compound all bad or doubtful debts, and, on a like order, may sell all the real and personal property ... and ... sue for and enforce the individual liability of the stockholders.' He shall 'pay all money received by him to the State Treasurer to be held as a special deposit ... shall also make quarterly reports to or when called upon, to the Comptroller.' The appointment must follow notice and be confirmed by the Circuit Court. Liquidation expenses are payable out of the corporate funds held by the Treasurer. 'The compensation of the liquidator shall be fixed by the Comptroller, and shall be based upon the amount of work actually necessary and performed, and shall in no case exceed five per cent. of the cash collections.'\n Respondent Therrell, liquidator for several banks, devoted substantially all his time to the work. He held no commission from the Governor, took no oath of office, but was formally appointed by the Comptroller and gave bond. His compensation, for 1931 and 1932, paid from corporate assets, was assessed by the Commissioner for federal income taxes. The Board of Tax Appeals approved; but the Circuit Court of Appeals, Therrell v. Com'r of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir., 88 F.2d 869, found immun- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 218, 221]\n\u00a0\n ity under the Federal Constitution.\nNo. 129.\n Respondent Tunnicliffe, liquidator of insolvent banks appointed by the Comptroller of Florida, was assessed for federal income taxes upon the sums received for services during 1931 and 1932. The Board of Tax Appeals approved; the Circuit Court of Appeals, Tunnicliffe v. Com'r of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir., 88 F.2d 873, ruled otherwise upon its opinion in No. 128. Both causes present the same points.\nNo. 287.\n Petitioner McLoughlin was employed by the Insurance Department of New York as legal counsel in the Liquidation Bureau and received for services during 1932, $5,125. This bureau is in charge of a Deputy Superintendent of Insurance, a civil service employe whose salary is paid by the state. It employs many persons-superintendents, attorneys, bookkeepers, stenographers, adjusters, accountants, etc.\n Under the statutes the superintendent may apply to the court for an order to take over the assets of an insolvent insurance company and liquidate its affairs. When this issues, the corporate charter is dissolved and the superintendent must proceed to collect assets, adjust claims, etc. He determined petitioner's compensation and caused it to be paid from assets of the several companies in liquidation according to the time devoted to each.\n The Commissioner assessed this compensation for federal income tax; the Board of Tax Appeals approved. The Circuit Court of Appeals, McLoughlin v. Com'r of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 89 F.2d 699, affirmed, and definitely held it was not exempted by the Federal Constitution.\nNo. 597.\n Freedman, employed as an attorney in Pennsylvania's Department of Justice, received annual salary of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 218, 222]\n\u00a0\n $3,000. The Attorney General has power to appoint attorneys to represent any department, board or commission of the state and fix their compensation. The Secretary of Banking has broad powers over banks. When one becomes unsound, he may, after notice and hearing and with the Attorney General's consent, take possession and wind up its affairs. All necessary expenses, including compensation of attorneys, special deputies, assistants, and others employed about the proceedings, are paid from funds of the corporation.\n During 1932 the respondent was assigned for legal work relating to closed banks and was paid by the Secretary of Banking out of their funds. The Commissioner assessed the sum so received for federal income tax. The Board of Tax Appeals approved; the Circuit Court of Appeals, Freedman v. Com'r of Internal Revenue, 3 Cir., 92 F.2d 150, declared the salary exempt.\n What limitations does the Federal Constitution impose upon the United States in respect of taxing instrumentalities and agencies employed by a state and, conversely, how far does it inhibit the states from taxing instrumentalities and agencies utilized by the United States, are questions often considered here.

Commissioner, \n300 \nU.S. 352\n, 57 S.Ct. 495, 108 A.L.R. 1428. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 218, 223]\n\u00a0\n The Constitution contemplates a national government free to use its delegated powers; also state governments capable of exercising their essential reserved powers; both operate within the same territorial limits; consequently the Constitution itself, either by word or necessary inference, makes adequate provision for preventing conflict between them.\n Among the inferences which derive necessarily from the Constitution are these: No state may tax appropriate means which the United States may employ for exercising their delegated powers; the United States may not tax instrumentalities which a state may employ in the discharge of her essential governmental duties-that is those duties which the framers intended each member of the Union would assume in order adequately to function under the form of government guaranteed by the Constitution.\n By definition precisely to delimit 'delegated powers' or 'essential governmental duties' is not possible. Controversies involving these terms must be decided as they arise, upon consideration of all the relevant circumstances. Notwithstanding discordant views which have sometimes arisen because of varying emphasis given to one or another of such circumstances, it is now settled doctrine that the inferred exemption from federal taxation does not extend to every instrumentality which a state may see fit to employ. Exemption depends upon the nature of the undertaking; it is cabined by the reason which underlies the inference.\n Veazie Bank v. Fenno, supra, sustained a tax laid by the federal government upon notes issued by state banks, notwithstanding the view entertained by two Justices that it amounted to 'taxation of the powers and faculties of the State governments, which are essential to their sovereignty, and to the efficient and independ- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 218, 224]\n\u00a0\n ent management and administration of their internal affairs.'\n South Carolina v. United States, supra, gave occasion for much consideration of the federal government's power to tax instrumentalities utilized by a state. It ruled, against a stout dissent, that although South Carolina had the right to control the sale of liquors through the dispensary system nevertheless Congress could tax the dispensers who acted as agents of the state in making sales. 'Looking, therefore, at the Constitution in the light of the conditions surrounding at the time of its adoption, it is obvious that the framers, in granting full power over license taxes to the national government, meant that that power should be complete; and never thought that the states, by extending their functions, could practically destroy it.'\n Burnet v. A. T. Jergins Trust, supra, upheld a federal tax upon the receipts by the lessee of oil lands which belonged to the city of Long Beach, Cal. 'The subject of the tax is so remote from any governmental function as to render the effect of the exaction inconsiderable as respects the activities of the city.'\n In Ohio v. Helvering, supra, we held that the agencies and operations of the state of Ohio in the conduct of its Department of Liquor Control were subject to excise taxes prescribed by Congress. 'Whenever a state engages in a business of a private nature, its exercises nongovernmental functions, and the business, though conducted by the state, is not immune from the exercise of the power of taxation which the Constitution vests in the Congress.'\n Helvering v. Powers, supra, ruled that the compensation of members of the Board of Trustees of the Boston Elevated Railway Company was subject to the federal income tax notwithstanding they were appointed by the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 218, 225]\n\u00a0\n Governor of the state, confirmed by the council, and endowed with large powers to regulate and fix fares, etc. 'The fact that the state has power to undertake such enterprises, and that they are undertaken for what the state conceives to be the public benefit, does not establish immunity.'\n The cases last referred to strikingly illustrate the outcome of efforts here to apply the recognized doctrine in respect of taxing state agencies. According to them and others of like nature due weight, we are unable to conclude that the Commissioner erred in making any one of the assessments involved in the four cases presently before us. He gave proper application to the rule which we must recognize as established. The compensation of the taxpayers was paid from corporate assets-not from funds belonging to the state. No one of them was an officer of the state in the strict sense of that term. The business about which they were employed was not one utilized by the state in the discharge of her essential governmental duties. The corporations in liquidation were private enterprises; their funds were the property of private individuals.\n It follows that the judgments in Nos. 128, 129, and 597 must be reversed; the judgment in No. 287 must be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Mandate conformed to see 97 F.2d 1014, 1015. \n\n\n\n\n","65":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v.

Gen., and Arnold Raum, of Washington D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Thomas M. Wilkins, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent-in his 1932 income tax return-deducted from his gross income brokerage commissions paid and incurred in purchasing securities during that taxable year. Section 23(a) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 26 U.S. C.A.  23(a), allows as deductions 'All the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business, including a reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered; ....' Respondent contends that he was \n\n[305 \nU.S. 79, 81]\n\u00a0\n engaged in the 'business' of buying and selling securities and that the brokerage commissions amounted to 'compensation for personal services actually rendered' within the meaning of Section 23(a).\n The Government insists that brokers' commissions in security purchases are 'expenditures, ... properly chargeable to capital account' constituting 'a part of the cost' of such property and serving only to increase respondent's loss from sales of stock under Sections 111 and 23(r) which control allowable losses on disposal of stocks. \n1\n Section 23(r) allows losses on stock sales to be deducted only to the extent of gains realized from such sales. \n2\n If respond- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 79, 82]\n\u00a0\n ent was engaged in the 'business' of buying and selling securities, and the brokers' commissions were not a 'part of the cost' of the securities purchased, but were ordinary business expenses (as defined in Section 23(a )), respondent was justified in deducting the brokers' commissions from his gross income for the taxable year. However, if these commissions represent a part of the cost of the securities, respondent's right to deduct is limited by Section 23(r).\n The Commissioner refused to permit the deductions beyond the extent of stock losses. His action was affirmed by the Board of Tax Appeals. \n3\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held the commissions deductible if respondent was engaged in the business of buying and selling securities, and remanded for a finding as to the nature of his business. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Article 282, Treasury Regulation 77, issued under the 1932 Act, provides that 'Commissions paid in purchasing securities are a part of the cost price of such securities.' If this regulation governs, the respondent's contention cannot be sustained.\n Regulations promulgated under the 1916 income tax law, 39 Stat. 756, treated commissions in security purchases as a part of the securities' cost and not as ordinary expense deductions. \n5\n This interpretation has consistently reappeared in all regulations under succeeding tax statutes. \n6\n In the period since 1916 statutes have from time to time altered allowable deductions, but it is significant that Congress \n\n[305 \nU.S. 79, 83]\n\u00a0\n substantially retained the original taxing provisions on which these regulations have rested.\n Treasury regulations and interpretations long continued without substantial change, applying to unamended or substantially reenacted statutes, are deemed to have received congressional approval and have the effect of law. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n There has been tacit, if not express judicial approval for the administrative treatment of commissions as an element of the cost of securities. In Hutton v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 39 F.2d 459, 460, the Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that 'It has long been a settled rule of the Treasury Department that commissions paid in purchasing securities are a capital expenditure as part of the cost price of the securities.'\n In recognition of this administrative regulation, it has been said here that '... commissions (paid for marketing bonds) do not differ from brokerage commissions paid upon the purchase or sale of property. The regulations have consistently treated such commissions, not as items of current expense, but as additions to the cost of the property or deductions from the proceeds of sale, in arriving at net capital profit or loss for purposes of computing the tax.' \n 8\n\u00a0\n\n Respondent points to an apparent inconsistency between the general provision in Treasury Regulation 77, Article 121, that 'Among the items included in business expenses are ... commissions,' and Article 282 which specifically and particularly declares that 'Commissions paid in purchasing securities are a part of the cost price of such securities.' Special provisions limit the application of those of a broad and general nature relating to the same subject. The special designation of security \n\n[305 \nU.S. 79, 84]\n\u00a0\n purchase commissions as a 'part of the cost price of such securities' contained in Article 282 evinces the clear intent to withdraw that special type of commission from the general classification of Article 121.9\n Nor can it be inferred that the addition of Section 23(r) to the 1932 Act indicated any congressional purpose to alter or repeal the long existing administrative interpretation of non-deductible capital expenditures under which brokers' purchase commissions have been uniformly considered as a part of the cost of securities and not as current business expenses. This new statutory restriction of the allowance for losses from sales of stock bears no such relationship to the definition of cost price of securities as to lead to the conclusion that Congress intended to overthrow and abandon a settled practice of determining the elements of cost.\n The brokers' purchase commissions here constituted a part of the acquisition cost of the securities involved, and are not allowable to the taxpayer as a deduction from gross income under Section 23(a) of the Revenue Act of 1932. Congress, in the exercise of its power to deny or limit deductions from gross income,10 has-by Section 23(r)-limited this taxpayer's allowable deduction. He has a right to a deduction 'only to the extent of ... gains from ... sales or exchanges of stocks and bonds' as therein provided. The fact-if it be a fact-that respondent was engaged in the business of buying and selling securities does not entitle him to take a deduction contrary to this provision.\n The cause is reversed and remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for action in harmony with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act of 1932, c. 209, 47 Stat. 169, ' 111.

The bill also alleged that the defendants (appellants here) composing the State Tax Commission of the state of Washington had demanded the tax of 2 per cent. of this sum and unless enjoined would assess penalties on the tax amounting to $2,044.08, and would cause summary process to be issued for the seizure and sale of the company's property and that its business would thereby be interfered with to its irreparable damage in the sum of more than $100,000, and that the company was without an adequate remedy at law. The validity of the tax was assailed under the commerce and due process clauses of the Federal Constitution. An interlocutory injunction was sought and the case was heard in the District Court by three judges. 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380. It was stipulated that the case be submitted for final determination on its merits and decree was entered permanently enjoining the enforcement of the tax. 15 F.Supp. 302. The case comes here on appeal.\n By its order of October 11, 1937, this Court noted probable jurisdiction and directed the attention of counsel to the questions as to ( 1) the existence of the required jurisdictional amount and (2) the adequacy of the remedy at law. Appellants concede that in view of the terms of the statute prohibiting any action to recover the tax, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 17, 19]\n\u00a0\n if paid, except as therein provided, Laws of Washington, 1935, chapter 180, title 18, p. 837,  199, there would be no remedy available at law in the federal court and hence that federal equity jurisdiction would not be outsted. City Bank Farmers' Trust Company v. Schnader, \n291 \nU.S. 24, 29\n, 54 S.Ct. 259, 261. With respect to the jurisdictional amount, it appears on the face of the complaint that the tax, the enforcement of which is sought to be enjoined, amounted only to $2,044.08 and that the damages alleged would be incurred only by failure to make the required payment. It follows that the requisite jurisdictional amount is not involved. See Healy v. Ratta, \n292 \nU.S. 263, 268\n, 54 S.Ct. 700, 702, and cases there cited.\n Appellee moves for leave to file an affidavit to supplement the record for the purpose of showing the amount of the tax for succeeding months. The motion is denied. The Court is of the opinion that the case should be decided upon the record before it and that the jurisdiction of the District Court should be tested by the case made by the bill of complaint. The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court, with directions to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction.\n It is so ordered.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","67":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHIGHWAY ENGINEERING & CONSTRUCTION CO. v.

Beise and Reese McCloskey, both of Durango, Colo., for appellee. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 95]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Company, a Colorado corporation, owns a ditch by which it diverts from that river in Colorado water for irrigation. On July 5, 1928, it brought in the district court for La Plata county a suit which charged that since June 24, 1928, the defendants, Hinderlider, State Engineer of Colorado, and his subordinates, have so administered the water of the river as to deprive the plaintiff of water which it claims the right to divert. A mandatory injunction was sought.\n The defendants admit that in administering the water of the stream during the period named they shut the headgate of the Ditch Company so as to deprive it of water for purposes of irrigation; but assert that they did so pursuant to the requirements of the La Plata River Compact entered into by the States of Colorado and New Mexico with the consent of the Congress of the United States. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 96]\n\u00a0\n The Compact provides that each State shall receive a definite share of water under the varying conditions which obtain during the year, and, among other thing:1\n'1. At all times between the 1st day of December and the 15th day of the succeeding February each State shall have the unrestricted right to the use of all water which may flow within its boundaries.\n\n'2. By reason of the usual annual rise and fall, the flow of said river between the 15th day of February and the 1st day of December of each year shall be approtioned between the States in the following manner:\n\n'(a) Each State shall have the unrestricted right to use all the waters within its boundaries in each day when the mean daily flow at the interstate station is one hundred cubic feet per second, or more.\n\n'(b) On all other days, the State of Colorado shall deliver at the interstate station a quantity of water equiv- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 97]\n\u00a0\n alent to one-half of the mean flow at the Hesperus station for the preceding day, but not to exceed one hundred cubic feet per second.\n\n'3. Whenever the flow of the river is so low that in the judgment of the State engineers of the States the greatest beneficial use of its waters may be secured by distributing all of its water successively to the lands in each State in alternating periods, in lieu of delivery of water as provided in the second paragraph of this article, the use of the waters may be so rotated between the two States in such manner, for such periods, and to continue for such time as the State Engineers may jointly determine.'\n\n For the administration of water rights, Colorado and New Mexico each set up an administrative system with the State Engineers at its head. The State Engineers agreed that, in order to put the water to its most efficient use in the hot summer months of 1928, when the river was very low, the whole of the available supply should be rotated between the two States. In other words, that each State should be permitted to enjoy the entire flow of the river during alternating ten-day periods. During the ten days commencing June 24, 1928, all the water of the river (except small amounts diverted in Colorado for domestic and stock requirements) was thus allowed to pass to New Mexico; and during the succeeding ten-day period all the water in the stream was similarly allowed to be diverted in Colorado. The defendant water officials contend that in so rotating the water of the stream they administered it as required by the Compact and wisely.\n The La Plata River rises in the mountains of Colorado, flows in a southerly direction until it reaches the boundary of New Mexico and in the latter State until it empties into the San Juan River. The stream is nonnavigable; has a narrow watershed; and a large run-off in the early spring. Then the quantity flowing begins to fall rapidly; \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 98]\n\u00a0\n and during the summer months little water is available for irrigation. In each State the water of the stream has long been used for irrigation; and each adopted the so-called appropriation doctrine of water use. \n2\n Under that doctrine the first person who acts toward the diversion of water from a natural stream and the application of such water to a beneficial use has the first right, provided he diligently continues his enterprise to completion and beneficially applies the water. The rights of subsequent appropriations are subject to rights already held in the stream.\n The relative rights of all claimants to divert in Colorado water from the La Plata River were adjudicated in a proceeding under the Colorado statutes. By decree therein of January 12, 1898 (and later amended), the Ditch Company was declared entitled to divert 39 1\/4 cubic feet of water per second, subject to five senior priorities aggregating 19 second feet. On June 24, 1928, there was in the stream, at the recognized Colorado gauging station, 57 second feet of water. The Ditch Company claimed that by reason of the 1898 decree it was entitled to all the water in the stream except that required to satisfy the Colorado priorities. If it had been permitted to draw all that water, none would have been available to the New Mexico water claimants, who, under similar laws, had made appropriations. Some of them were earlier in date than the Ditch Company's. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 99]\n\u00a0\n The case was first heard in the District Court on evidence in 1930. The Ditch Company objected at the trial to the admission or consideration of the Compact. It insisted that the Compact attempted to surrender to New Mexico, and thus destroy. vested property rights of Colorado citizens; that this is a violation of the obligations of its contract; and that the Compact in so far as it 'applies or is intended to apply to private rights of the individuals or citizens of Colorado, or to be used as a defense of or justification for the acts of the State Engineer or his subordinates in interfering with or violating the private rights of citizens of Colorado, or in attempting to disregard, ignore or set aside the decrees of this ( District) Court for the distribution of water in accordance with the decrees, is unconstitutional and void,' in violation of the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution and of article 2, section 25 of the Constitution of Colorado.\n The District Court overruled the objection; found in substance the facts stated above; held that the Compact justified the action of defendants; and entered a decree that the bill be dismissed, each party to bear its own costs. That judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of the State (one judge dissenting), La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co. v. Hinderlider, 93 Colo. 128, 25 P.2d 187, 189. The opinion declared: 'There is not the slightest pretense, either in this compact itself or in the proceedings leading up to it, to a decision of the question of what water Colorado owns, or what water New Mexico owns, or what their respective citizens own. It is a mere compromise of presumably conflicting claims, a trading therein, in which the property of citizens is bartered, without notice or hearing, and with no regard to vested right.'\n An appeal to this Court was dismissed for want of final judgment below. Hinderlider v. La Plata River & Cherry \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 100]\n\u00a0\n Creek Ditch Co., \n291 \nU.S. 650\n, 54 S.Ct. 557. The case was then retried by the Distric Court on the same pleadings and evidence; and, pursuant to the opinion of the Supreme Court of Colorado, a decree was entered which, after reciting in substance the facts above stated, declared: '6. That the said La Plata River Compact, entered into between the States of Colorado and New Mexico with the consent of the Congress of the United States of America, does not constitute a defense to the actions of said defendant water officials complained of by plaintiff, and is not available to said defendant water officials, as a legal defense or justification for their acts in closing and shutting down the headgate of plaintiff and depriving the said plaintiff, thereby, of its right to the use of the waters from said La Plata River for irrigation purposes, as provided by the terms and provisions of said decree of adjudication of January 12, 1898.'\n The decree specifically: '(3) Enjoined and commanded (the defendants) to permit the diversion through the plaintiff's headgate (of) water for plaintiff's ditch in accordance with the terms of said decree at any and all times when there is water in said stream to which said decree, under its terms and conditions would apply:'\n This second judgment of the trial court was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State; an additional opinion being delivered by the court, and a dissent by a different justice. 101 Colo. 73, 70 P.2d 849. An appeal to this Court was allowed by the Acting Chief Justice of the State. \n3\n Pursuant to the Act of Congress, August 24, 1937, c. 754, 50 Stat. 751, 28 U.S.C.A.  401, 349a, 380a and note 17 and note, the attention of the Attorney Gen- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 101]\n\u00a0\n eral of the United States was directed to the contention that the validity of a federal statute is involved, \n302 \nU.S. 646\n, 58 S.Ct. 123, 82 L.Ed. --. He filed memoranda in which he contended that: '(1) This Court is included in the courts to which section 1 of the Act of August 24, 1937 (28 U.S.C.A .  401) is applicable; (2) the constitutionality of the compact is drawn in question whether or not a decision on this point is necessary; (3) a compact is an Act of Congress; and (4) it is an Act 'affecting the public interest.\"\n Opposing some of the views expressed by the Attorney General, a brief was filed on behalf of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia, the Port of New York Authority and the Delaware River Joint Commission.\n The Ditch Company moved to dismiss the appeal, contending among other things, that the mere fact that the Compact was approved by Congress does not make it a federal statute within the meaning of the jurisdictional act authorizing appeals. Decision on the motion to dismiss was postponed to the hearing on the merits. For reasons to be stated, we are of opinion that the case is not reviewable on appeal; that it presents a federal question reviewable on certiorari; that because of its importance certiorari should be granted; and that the judgment must be reversed.\n First. As the La Plata River flows from Colorado into New Mexico and in each State the water is used beneficially, it must be equitably apportioned between the two. The decision below in effect ignores that rule. It holds immaterial the fact that the acts complained of were being done in compliance with the Compact, and does so on the ground that the Compact in authorizing diversion and rotation violated rights awarded by the January 12, 1898 decree in the Colorado water proceeding; holds that the decree awarded to the Ditch Company the right to divert from the river 39 1\/4 cubic feet per second (subject \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 102]\n\u00a0\n only to the senior Colorado priorities of 19 second feet), even if by so doing it exhausts the whole flow of the stream and leaves nothing for the New Mexico claimants; and holds that the right so awarded is a vested property right which the two States, although acting with the consent of the United States, lacked power to diminish or modify except by a condemnation proceeding and payment of compensation. No such proceeding was provided for in the Compact and none was had otherwise.\n It may be assumed that the right adjudicated by the decree of January 12, 1898 to the Ditch Company is a property right, indefeasible so far as concerns the State of Colorado, its citizens, and any other person claiming water rights there. But the Colorado decree could not confer upon the Ditch Company rights in excess of Colorado's share of the water of the stream; and its share was only an equitable portion thereof.\n The claim that on interstate streams the upper State has such ownership or control of the whole stream as entitles it to divert all the water, regardless of any injury or prejudicice to the lower State, has been made by Colorado in litigation concerning other interestate streams, but has been consistently denied by this Court. The rule of equitable apportionment was settled by State of Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 97\n, 27 S.Ct. 655. It was discussed again in Wyoming v. Colorado, \n259 \nU.S. 419, 466\n, 42 S.Ct. 552, 558, where the Court said: 'The contention of Colorado that she as a state rightfully may divert and use, as she may choose, the waters flowing within her boundaries in this interstate stream, regardless of any prejudice that this may work to others having rights in the stream below her boundary, cannot be maintained. The river throughout its course in both states is but a single stream, wherein each state has an interest which should be respected by the other. A like contention was set up by Colorado in her answer in \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 103]\n\u00a0\n Kansas v. Colorado and was adjudged untenable. Further consideration satisfies us that the ruling was right.'\n And in New Jersey v. New York, \n283 \nU.S. 336, 342\n, 343 S., 51 S.Ct. 478, 479, the Court said of an interstate stream: 'It offers a necessity of life that must be rationed among those who have power over it. New York has the physical power to cut off all the water within its jurisdiction. But clearly the exercise of such a power to the destruction of the interest of lower States could not be tolerated. And on the other hand equally little could New Jersey be permitted to require New York to give up its power altogether in order that the river might come down to it undiminished. Both States have real and substantial interests in the River that must be reconciled as best they may.'\n The decree obviously is not res judicata so far as concerns the State of New Mexico and its citizens who claim the right to divert water from the stream in New Mexico. As they were not parties to the Colorado proceedings, they remain free to challenge the claim of the Ditch Company that it is entitled to take in Colorado all the water of the stream and leave nothing for them. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The declared purpose of the Compact was, as the preamble recites, equitable apportionment: 'The State of Colorado and the State of New Mexico, desiring to provide for the equitable distribution of the waters of the La Plata River and to remove all causes of present and future controversy between them with respect thereto, and being moved by considerations of interstate comity, pursuant to Acts of their respective legislatures, have resolved to conclude a compact for these purposes and have named as their Commissioners Delph \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 104]\n\u00a0\n E. Carpenter, for the State of Colorado, and Stephen B. Davis, junior, for the State of New Mexico, who have agreed upon the following articles.'\n The Supreme Court of Colorado held the Compact unconstitutional because, for aught that appears, it embodies not a judicial, or quasi- judicial, decision of controverted rights, but a trading compromise of conflicting claims. The assumption that a judicial or quasi-judicial decision of the controverted claims is essential to the validity of a compact adjusting them, rests upon misconception. It ignores the history and order of development of the two means provided by the Constitution for adjusting interstate controversies. The compact-the legislative means- adapts to our Union of sovereign States the age-old treaty making power of independent sovereign nations. Adjustment by compact without a judicial or quasi-judicial determination of existing rights had been practiced in the Colonies,5 was practiced by the States before the adoption of the Constitution,6 and had been extensively practiced in the United States for nearly half a century before this Court first applied the judicial means in settling the boundary dispute in Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 723-725.7\n The extent of the existing equitable right of Colorado and of New Mexico in the La Plata River could ob- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 105]\n\u00a0\n viously have been determined by a suit in this Court, as was done in Kansas v. Colorado, supra, in respect to rights in the Arkansas River and in Wyoming v. Colorado, supra, in respect to the Laramie. 8 But resort to the judicial remedy is never essential to the adjustment of interstate controversies, unless the States are unable to agree upon the terms of a compact, or Congress refuses its consent. The difficulties incident to litigation have led States to resort, with frequency, to adjustment of their controversies by compact, even where the matter in dispute was the relatively simple one of a boundary. In two such cases this Court suggested 'that the parties endeavor with consent of Congress to adjust their boundaries.' State of Minnesota v. Wisconsin, \n252 \nU.S. 273, 283\n, 40 S.Ct. 313, 319; State of Washington v. Oregon, \n214 \nU.S. 205, 217\n, 218 S., 29 S.Ct. 631.9 In New York v. New Jersey, \n256 \nU.S. 296, 313\n, 41 S.Ct. 492, 497, which involved a more intricate problem of rights in interstate waters, the recommendation that treaty- making be resorted to was more specific; 10 and compacts for the apportion- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 106]\n\u00a0\n ment of the water of interstate streams have been common. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Third. Whether the apportionment of the water of an interstate stream be made by compact between the upper and lower States with the consent of Congress or by a decree of this Court, the apportionment is binding upon the citizens of each State and all water claimants, even where the State had granted the water rights before it entered into the compact. That the private rights of grantees of a State are determined by the adjustment by compact of a disputed boundary was settled a century ago in Poole v. Fleeger, 11 Pet. 185, 209, where the Court said: 'It cannot be doubted, that it is a part of the general right of sovereignty, belonging to independent nations, to establish and fix the disputed boundaries between their respective territories; and the boundaries so established and fixed by compact between nations, become conclusive upon all the subjects and citizens thereof, and bind their righs; and are to be treated, to all intents and purposes, as the true and real boundaries. This is a doctrine universally recognized in the law and practice of nations. It is a right equally belonging to the states of this Union; unless it has been surrendered under the constitution of the United States. So far from there being any pretense of such a general surrender of the right, that it is expressly recognized by the constitution, and guarded in its exercise by a single limitation or restriction, requiring the consent of congress.'\n In Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 725, the Court, discussing the origin and scope of the Compact clause, said: \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 107]\n\u00a0\n 'If Congress consented, then the states were in this respect restored to their original inherent sovereignty; such consent being the sole limitation imposed by the constitution, when given, left the states as they were before, as held by this court in Poole v. Fleeger, 11 Pet. (185), 209 (9 L.Ed. 680); whereby their compacts became of binding force, and finally settled the boundary between them; operating with the same effect as a treaty between sovereign powers. That is, that the boundaries so established and fixed by compact between nations, become conclusive upon all the subjects and citizens thereof, and bind their rights; and are to be treated to all intents and purposes, as the true real boundaries.'\n See, also, Garcia v. Lee, 12 Pet. 511, 521; Coffee v. Groover, \n123 \nU.S. 1, 29\n, 30 S., 31, 8 S.Ct. 1; State of Virginia v. Tennessee, \n148 \nU.S. 503, 525\n, 13 S.Ct. 728.\n The rule as applied to the apportionment by judicial decree of the water of an interstate stream was stated in Wyoming v. Colorado, \n286 \nU.S. 494, 508\n, 52 S.Ct. 621, 627: 'But it is said that water claims other than the tunnel appropriation could not be, and were not, affected by the decree, because the claimants were not parties to the suit or represented therein. In this the nature of the suit is misconceived. It was one between states, each acting as a quasi sovereign and representative of the interests and rights of her people in a controversy with the other. Counsel for Colorado insisted in their brief in that suit that the controversy was 'not between private parties' but 'between the two sovereignties of Wyoming and Colorado'; and this court in its opinion assented to that view, but observed that the controversy was one of immediate and deep concern to both states and that the interests of each were indissloubly linked with those of her appropriators. Wyoming v. Colorado, 259 U.S. (419), 468, 42 S.Ct. 552, 558. Decisions in other cases also warrant the conclusion that the water claimants in Colo- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 108]\n\u00a0\n rado, and those in Wyoming, were represented by their respective states and are bound by the decree.'\n Fourth. As the States had power to bind by compact their respective appropriators by division of the flow of the stream, they had power to reach that end either by providing for a continuous equal division of the water from time to time in the stream, or by providing for alternate periods of flow to the one State and to the other of all the water in the stream. To secure 'the greatest beneficial use of' the water in the stream, the Compact provided that the water may be 'rotated between the two States, in such manner for such periods, and to continue for such time as the State Engineers may jointly determine.' That such alternate rotating flow was then a more efficient use of the stream than if the flow had been steadily divided equally between the Colorado and the New Mexico appropriators was conclusively established by the evidence. That is, the rotating supply which the Compact authorized, and the two State Engineers agreed upon, was clearly more beneficial to the Ditch Company than to have given to it and other Colorado appropriators steadily one-half of the water in the river. The delegation to the State Engineers of the authority to determine when the waters should be so rotated was a matter of detail clearly within the constitutional power. There is no claim that the authority conferred was abused.\n Fifth. As Colorado possessed the right only to an equitable share of the water in the stream, the decree of January 12, 1898, in the Colorado water proceeding did not award to the Ditch Company any right greater than the equitable share. Hence the apportionment made by the Compact can not have taken from the Ditch Company any vested right, unless there was in the proceedings leading up to the Compact or in its application, some vitiating infirmity. No such infirmity or illegality \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 109]\n\u00a0\n has been shown. There is no allegation in the pleadings, no evidence in the record, no suggestion in brief or argument, that the apportionment agreed upon by the commissioners was entered into without due enquiry; or that it was not an honest exercise of judgment; or even that it was, or is, inequitable. The fact that the appointment of the Joint Commissioners was authorized in 1921, that their agreement was not adopted by the States until 1923, and that it was not approved by Congress until 1925 shows that there was ample time for consideration by all concerned. There is no suggestion that the Ditch Company, or indeed anyone else, was denied by the commissioners opportunity to be heard; or even that any water claimant objected to the terms of the Compact. It appears that although the State of Colorado was not permitted to intervene in this litigation, State of Colorado v. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co., 101 Colo. 368, 73 P. 2d 997, its Attorney General represented the State's water officials. Moreover, the Compact provides in Article VI that it 'may be modified or terminated at any time by mutual consent'; and there is not even a suggestion that either State, or the Ditch Company, has expressed a desire to modify or terminate it.\n Sixth. The water officials rely for their defense upon the rule requiring equitable apportionment of the water of an interstate stream and the action of Congress in approving the adjustment of the equitable apportionment which the States made by their compacts. The assent of Congress to the compact between Colorado and New Mexico does not make it a 'treaty or statute of the United States' within the meaning of section 237( a) of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a), and no question as to the validity of the consent is presented. People of New York v. Central R.R., 12 Wall. 455. A claim based on the equitable interstate apportionment of water, like one based on the proper location of a State boundary, is not within the provisions of \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 110]\n\u00a0\n section 237(a). Rust Land & Lumber Co. v. Jackson, \n250 \nU.S. 71\n, 39 S.Ct. 424. The appeal must therefore be dismissed. But in holding that the State Engineer and his subordinates should be enjoined from taking action required by the Compact the State Court denied an important claim under the Constitution which may be reviewed on certiorari by this Court under section 237(b), as amended, 28 U.S.C.A.  344(b). For the decision below necessarily rests upon the premise that at the time the compact was made Colorado was absolutely entitled to at least 58 1\/4 cubic feet of water per second regardless of the amount left for New Mexico. The judgment cannot stand if this determination is erroneous. For whether the water of an interstate stream must be apportioned between the two States is a question of 'federal common law' upon which neither the statutes nor the decisions of either State can be conclusive. State of Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 95\n, 97 S., 98, 27 S.Ct. 655; Connecticut v. Massachusetts, \n282 \nU.S. 660, 669\n, 671 S., 51 S.Ct. 286, 289; New Jersey v. New York, \n283 \nU.S. 336, 342\n, 343 S., 51 S.Ct. 478, 479; Washington v. Oregon, \n297 \nU.S. 517, 528\n, 56 S.Ct. 540, 545. Jurisdiction over controversies concerning rights in interstate streams is not different from those concerning boundaries. These have been recognized as presenting federal questions. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n It has been suggested that this Court lacks jurisdiction to determine the validity and effect of the Compact because Colorado and New mexico, the parties to it, are not \n\n[304 \nU.S. 92, 111]\n\u00a0\n parties to this suit and cannot be made so.

LOWREY(1938)\nNo. 24\nArgued: October 19, 1938Decided: November 7, 1938\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edward E. Odom and James T. Brady, both of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Wm. Dike Reed and Louis J. Altkrug, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 500 of the World War Veterans' Act1 (as applicable here) prohibits the recognition of attorneys or \n\n[305 \nU.S. 85, 86]\n\u00a0\n claim agents in the presentation or adjudication of veterans' War Risk Insurance claims; limits to ten dollars the payment for assisting in the preparation and execution of an application to the Veterans' Bureau; permits a court-rendering a favorable judgment or decree on a veteran's claim-to allow the veteran's attorney a fee not to exceed ten per cent of the amount recovered; and makes soliciting or obtaining any fee greater than the statute provides a crime subject to a maximum punishment of a $ 500 fine and two years imprisonment.\n A committee (guardian appointed by a New York state court) for an insane veteran retained an attorney to prosecute the rights of the incompetent on a War Risk Insurance contract. The New York court was petitioned for an attorney's fee of $3,000. Upon hearing, it appeared that the attorney had performed services of an investiga- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 85, 87]\n\u00a0\n tional and preparatory nature in the prosecution of the veteran's claim; that contrary to Section 500, he had been recognized by the Bureau and permitted to join with a representative of the Disabled War Veterans in presenting the claim to the Bureau; and that subsequently, but without litigation, judicial decree or judgment against the government, the government paid the guardian an amount in excess of $10,000 on the claim. The New York court allowed a fee of $1,500 for the attorney's services, over the objection of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs who intervened and insisted that Section 500 prohibited any fee in excess of $ 10 in this case. \n2\n We can assume, in the consideration of questions here presented, that valuable services were rendered by the attorney.\n Respondent seeks to sustain the $1,500 fee upon the theory that the general power of the New York court to fix fees for services rendered an incompetent under that court's jurisdiction is not subject to the limitation of $10 for fees as provided in Section 500. He urges that the present case is controlled by the decision in Hines v. Stein, \n298 \nU.S. 94\n, 56 S.Ct. 699. In that case the Court said (page 701), 'Nothing brought to our attention would justify the view that Congress intended to deprive state courts of their usual authority over fiduciaries, or to sanction the promulgation of rules to that end by executive offices or bureaus.' This language did not refer to Section 500, which we now consider, but was a construction and interpretation of rules promulgated by the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs under authority of  4 and 7 of an Act of March 20, 1933, c. 3, 48 Stat. 9, which rules were traceable to  111, 114 and 115, Title 38, U.S.C., 38 U.S.C.A.  111, 114 and 115. These Code Sections are based upon an Act passed in 1884\n\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 85, 88]\n\u00a0\n Obviously, the interpretation given rules promulgated in furtherance of a line of legislation dating from 1884 cannot be accepted as controlling in determining the intent and effect of a separate and distinct act (Section 500) differing in form, substance and historical background. The rules and statutes construed in Hines v. Stein, supra, have no bearing on this case, which must be determined by the application of Section 500.\n Section 500 is one in a series of congressional efforts to limit fees of claim agents and attorneys in the prosecution of veterans' insurance and related claims. Shortly after the United States entered the World War, Congress provided a comprehensive statutory plan of War Risk Insurance for soldiers and sailors. \n3\n Section 13 of that statute contained this provision: 'The director shall adopt reasonable and proper rules ..., to regulate the matter of the compensation, if any, but in no case to exceed ten per centum, to be paid to claim agents and attorneys for services in connection with' collection of soldiers' and sailors' benefits.\n May 20, 1918, Congress amended Section 13 of the 1917 Act. \n4\n The House report shows that this amendment was strongly urged by the Secretary of the Treasury, then administering the World War Veterans' Act. \n5\n The 1918 \n\n[305 \nU.S. 85, 89]\n\u00a0\n amendment is substantially the same as Section 500, and in a case involving the meaning of that amendment this Court said, 'Petitioner claims that the inhibition against receiving any sum greater than $3 ($10 under Section 500) relates solely to the clerical work of filling out the form or affidavit of claim and does not apply to useful investigation and preparatory work such as he did. ...\n'We find no reason which would justify disregard of the plain language of the section under consideration. It declares that any person who receives a fee or compensation in respect of a claim under the act except as therein provided, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. The only compensation which it permits a claim agent or attorney to receive where no legal proceeding has been commenced is $3 for assistance in preparation and execution of necessary papers; and the history of the enactment indicates plainly enough that Congress did not fail to choose apt language to express its purpose.' \n6\n (Italics supplied.)\n\n In 1926, Congress enacted additional legislation for the specific protection of incompetent veterans from illegal or excessive fees where guardians had been appointed by any court-State or Federal. \n7\n Congress declared that 'whenever it appears that any guardian, curator, conservator or other person, in the opinion of the Administrator, is not properly executing or has not properly executed the duties of his trust or has collected or paid, or is attempting to collect or pay, fees, commissions, or allowances that are inequitable or in excess of those allowed by law for the duties performed ..., then and in \n\n[305 \nU.S. 85, 90]\n\u00a0\n that event the Administrator is empowered by his duly authorized attorney to appear in the court which has appointed such fiduciary, ... and make proper presentation of such matters ....'8 (Italics supplied.)\n The history of Section 500 manifests beyond doubt the clear establishment of a public policy against the payment of fees for prosecution of veterans' claims in excess of those fixed by statute. Collection of a greater fee than that fixed in the statute is made a crime, and this Court has sustained a conviction under the statute. \n9\n Contracts for the collection of fees in excess of valid statutory limitations and for services validly prohibited by statute cannot stand, whether made with a competent veteran or the guardian of an incompetent veteran. Nor can any court having jurisdiction over an incompetent award a fee in violation of a valid statute. Congress clearly intended to protect all veterans, competent and incompetent, in all courts, State and Federal, against the imposition or payment of fees in excess of the amount fixed by statute. In furtherance of this policy the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs was charged with the express duty of appearing in all courts where it appears that 'any guardian ... or other person ... is attempting to collect fees ... in excess of those allowed by law.' The progressive strengthening of this particular legislative policy precludes any probability that Congress intended to exempt mental incompetents from its protection, and Congress alone is vested with constitutional power to determine the wisdom of this policy. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 85, 91]\n\u00a0\n Congressional enactments in pursuance of constitutional authority are the supreme law of the land. Section 500 is a valid exercise of congressional power. \n10\n 'The laws of the United States are laws in the several States, and just as much binding on the citizens and courts thereof as the State laws are.' \n 11\n\u00a0\n\n No court has rendered a judgment or decree in favor of the incompetent veteran and against the government, in which the court as a part of its decree determined and allowed a reasonable fee for the attorney of the veteran. In the absence of such a judgment and decree an attorney's fee of more than $10 is contrary to the controlling congressional enactment. The judgment below being for more than this amount is unauthorized and the cause is reversed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Amount permitted to be paid agents or attorneys; solicitation, etc ., of unauthorized fees or compensation; punishment.

Any person who shall, directly or indirectly, solicit, contract for, charge, or receive, or who shall attempt to solicit, contract for, charge, or receive, any fee or compensation, except as herein provided, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and for each and every offense shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $500 or by imprisonment at hard labor for not more than two years, or by both such fine and imprisonment.' 43 Stat. 628, as amended 43 Stat. 1311, chapter 10, 38 U.S.C.  551, 38 U.

Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Robert B. Watts, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Luther Day, of Cleveland, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The motion before us involves a construction of section 10(d)(e) and ( f) of the National Labor Relations Act,1 providing for review of orders of the National Labor Relations Board.\n May 16, 1938, the Board filed in this court a motion for leave to file a petition for writs of prohibition and mandamus directed to the judges of the United States Circuit. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Attached to the motion was the petition which set forth the following facts.\n April 8, 1938, the Board, in a cause pending before it, issued an order directing the Republic Steel Corporation to desist from certain unfair labor practices and to take certain affirmative action. April 18 Republic filed in the Circuit Court of Appeals a petition for review alleging that the order violated the constitutional guarantee of due process because it was entered without an opportunity to Republic to support its contentions by argument or brief and thus the Board had denied it the hearing to which it was entitled. On the same day Republic requested of the Board a transcript of the entire record of its proceedings and the General Counsel of the Board \n\n[304 \nU.S. 486, 488]\n\u00a0\n replied: 'I have your letter of April 18th, and received today a copy of your petition for review of the Board's order filed in the Third Circuit. We will proceed to get up the record as promptly as possible for certification to the court.'\n The rules of the Board extend to any party the right, within a reasonable period after the close of a hearing, to present oral argument before the trial examiner and, with his permission, to file briefs. They further provide that the Board may decide a cause with or without allowing the parties to present oral argument before the Board itself or to submit briefs to the Board. It is the Board's practice to grant leave to submit briefs to it or to make oral argument before it whenever so requested, but the rules do not expressly state that such a request may be made or that the request, if made, will be granted. No such request was made by Republic and no brief was received or oral argument heard before the enty of th e order of April 8, 1938. The rules also provide for hearing before a trial examiner of causes initiated by the filing of charges before a regional director unless the cause is transferred for hearing before the Board in Washington. If the hearing is before an examiner he is to render an intermediate report containing findings of fact and recommendations as to the disposition of the cause, which are to be served upon the parties, and they are entitled to take exceptions to the intermediate report. In cases initiated by charges filed with the Board in Washington, or transferred for hearing before the Board, it may direct the trial examiner to prepare an intermediate report but the rules do not require that such a report shall be prepared or served, or that the Board shall serve its own proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The complaint against Republic was initiated by charges filed with the Board. The Board did not direct the trial examiner to prepare an intermediate report and none was \n\n[304 \nU.S. 486, 489]\n\u00a0\n prepared or served, nor did the Board serve its own proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law prior to the entry of its order.\n Subsequent to April 25, 1938, the Board instituted the practice of notifying the parties in all proceedings before it of their right to submit briefs to the Board and, upon request, to present oral argument to the Board; and further determined that, in cases thereafter to be decided, which had been initiated before it, or transferred to it for hearing ( except for special reasons in particular cases) an intermediate report should be prepared by the trial examiner and served upon the parties or, in the alternative, proposed findings of fact and conclusions should be prepared by the Board and similarly served with express notice to the parties of their right to take exceptions to the report or the proposed findings and, upon request, to be heard by the Board, orally or upon brief in support of the exceptions. In cases already decided, in which complaint had been made of the omission of an intermediate report or proposed findings, or of the lack of written or oral argument, the Board determined to vacate its orders, to restore the causes to its docket, and to reconsider and redetermine them after granting full opportunity of exception to proposed findings and conclusions and after the service of notice of the right of the parties to submit briefs and to be heard by the Board if they should so request. Among the cases in this category was that involving Republic.\n April 30, 1938, Republic moved the Circuit Court of Appeals for a stay of the Board's order and, upon the hearing of the motion, the Board advised the court that it was considering vacating the order. May 3, upon ex parte application of Republic, the court issued a rule, returnable May 13, requiring the Board to show cause why it should not file in the court a certified transcript of the record of the proceedings against Republic and \n\n[304 \nU.S. 486, 490]\n\u00a0\n made an order restraining the Board from taking any steps or proceedings whatsoever in the cause until the return day of the rule.\n May 13 the Board answered the rule of May 3 stating that the record was incomplete because the Board had determined on May 3 to vacate the order and to restore the cause to the docket for further proceedings and had been prevented from so doing by the restraining order issued May 3; the answer further set out that the provisions of section 10(d) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  160(d), deprive the court of jurisdiction to issue the restraining order and of jurisdiction to forbid the vacation of the Board's order and to compel the filing of a transcript of the Board's record as it stood prior to the decision to vacate the order. The court made the rule absolute and enjoined the Board from taking any further steps or proceedings in the cause until the transcript was filed.\n The petition of the National Labor Relations Board asserts that the court was without jurisdiction to take this action and prays awrit of mandamus directing the judges who participated to vacate the order of May 13 and a writ of prohibition against the exercise of jurisdiction upon the petition of Republic to set aside the order of April 8 without affording the Board a reasonable opportunity to vacate it.\n Upon presentation of the papers we granted leave to file them and entered a rule upon the judges of the Circuit Court to show cause why the relief should not be granted as prayed, returnable May 23, and directed that, on the return day, the parties should be heard upon the question of the jurisdiction of the court to make the challenged order.\n May 21, the judges filed their return admitting the allegations of the petition, except those as to the rules and practice of the Board, and its determination to vacate the orders in the Republic and other cases, which it \n\n[304 \nU.S. 486, 491]\n\u00a0\n neither admitted nor denied. The return showed that the order of May 13 was made in the view that, under section 10(f) of the act, 29 U.S.C.A.  160(f), Republic, by filing and serving its petition for relief, and by requesting the Board to file, or to deliver for filing, a certified transcript, complied with the jurisdictional requirements of the statute so far as was within Republic's power; that thereupon it became the duty of the Board forthwith to file a transcript and that, in the judges' opinion, jurisdiction of the court attached upon service of the petition for review and could not be defeated by the Board's failure to perform its statutory duty, which was to file the transcript. The return further shows that the court was of opinion that possible damage would result to Republic from delay due to the failure to file the transcript and this consideration moved the court to a construction of the act which called for the entry of its order. The return concludes as follows: 'Recognizing the debatable character of the question presented on this record, the respondents submit themselves to the judgment of this court as to whether or not they had jurisdiction to enter the order complained of and record their readiness to vacate the same if, in the opinion of this court, jurisdiction of the cause was lacking.'\n As is indicated by our action on the motion of the Board for leave to file, and by the return to the rule, the question is solely of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals. This question is to be answered in the light of section 10(d)(e) and (f) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  160(d, e, f) the pertinent portions of which are in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[304 \nU.S. 486, 492]\n\u00a0\n Counsel for the petitioner and for Republic have presented their views in oral argument and briefs.\n The Board's proceedings are administrative in character. Its final action is subject to judicial review in the manner specified in the act. Subsection (d) of section 10, in plain terms, invests the Board with authority, at any time before the transcript shall have been filed in court, to modify or set aside its order in whole or in part. The purpose of the provision obviously is to afford an opportunity to correct errors or to consider new evidence which would render the order inadequate or unjust. The words used are 'Until a transcript of the record ... shall have been filed in a court, as hereinafter provided', the Board may vacate or modify. The following subsections, (e) and (f), and those to which we turn for the connotation of the qualifying phrase. Subsection (e) grants the Board resort to a court for the enforcement of its order. That enforcement is to be obtained by filing a petition for enforcement and filing a certified \n\n[304 \nU.S. 486, 493]\n\u00a0\n transcript of the Board's proceedings. The subsection proceeds: 'Upon such filing, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon' the person against whom enforcement is asked. Here it is quite plain that the court is without jurisdiction to take action at the behest of the Board until the transcript shall have been filed and notice of the filing of the petition and the transcript has been served. Subsection (f) affords relief to 'any person aggrieved by a final order of the Board granting or denying in whole or in part the relief sought.' Such a person, the statute declares, 'may obtain a review' of the Board's order by filing in court 'a written petition praying that the order of the Board be modified or set aside.' A copy of the petition is to be served forthwith upon the Board, and 'thereupon the aggrieved party shall file in the court a transcript' of the Board's proceedings. 'Upon such filing, the court shall proceed in the same manner as in the case of an application by the Board under subsection (e).' Plainly the court may not proceed to review the Board's order under either section until a transcript is filed.\n Counsel for Republic urge, in support of the Circuit Court's action, that the words, 'as hereinafter provided', in subsection (d), refer to the filing of the transcript required in an enforcement proceeding initiated by the Board authorized by subsection (e) but cannot have reference to a proceeding for review initiated by any other party before the Board pursuant to subsection (f). The words of the statute do not warrant this construction. Two filings are required by subsection (f), the first of a petition, the second of a transcript. After prescribing the second, the act provides that 'Upon such filing, the court shall proceed in the same manner as in the case of an application by the Board under subsection (e).' The reference clearly is to the filing of the transcript and not to the filing of the petition. The con- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 486, 494]\n\u00a0\n tention that the act cannot be applied in accordance with its apparent intent is that, as only the Board can certify the proceedings, and the petitioner under subsection (f) must file the certified transcript, such a construction would enable the Board to hold the transcript for an indefinite period and thus harass and embarrass a litigant, and delay, and perhaps deny, any effective judicial review. No such case is here presented. We have no occasion to determine what, if any, relief may be needed by or available to a party who has filed his petition for review where the Board does not desire to modify or set aside its order, but fails or refuses to furnish a transcript of its proceedings.\n Jurisdiction as the term is to be applied in this instance, is the power to hear and determine the controversy presented, in a given setof circ umstances. A court has jurisdiction, in another use of the term, to examine the question whether that power is conferred upon it in the circumstances disclosed but if it finds such power is not granted it lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter and must refrain from any adjudication of rights in connection therewith. Since the statute empowers the Board, before the filing of a transcript, to vacate or modify its orders, certainly it does not confer jurisdiction upon the reviewing court to prohibit the exercise of the granted power. It is obvious that Congress intended to confer no jurisdiction upon the reviewing court to prevent the Board from seasonably vacating or modifying its order so as to make it comport with right and justice. The act plainly indicates that the purpose was to give the court full and exclusive jurisdiction to review the Board's order in the respects indicated by the act once the transcript of the Board's proceedings is before it. It is equally plain that the court is to have no power to prevent the Board from vacating or modifying its order prior to such plenary submission of the cause. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 486, 495]\n\u00a0\n Counsel for Republic urges that the Board's petition to this court indicates that it does not intend irrevocably to abandon its former order but merely to regularize it and re-enter it after regularization and that the act gives no power to do this after the Board has heard the case and issued an order. We have no occasion to speculate upon the future proceedings before the Board. It is enough that the petition shows that the Board desired to and would have vacated its order had it not been restrained by the action of the court. What the legal effect of its future proceedings may be we need not decide.\n Counsel insist that Republic is aggrieved, within the meaning of subsection (f), by the Board's attempt to retain jurisdiction of the proceeding and take further steps in it. But the act grants a review and relief only to a person aggrieved by an order of the Board and had the court not restrained the Board its order would have been vacated and there now would be no order outstanding. The Board is given no power of enforcement. Compliance is not obligatory until the court, on petition of the Board or any party aggrieved, shall have entered a decree enforcing the order as made, or as modified by the court. Statutory authority to the Board to vacate its order prior to the filing of the transcript does not seem to us to differ materially from a like statutory authority to a master in chancery to modify or recall his report to a court after submission but before action by the court. No one could successfully claim to be aggrieved in a legal sense by such a statutory provision or assert that the legislature is incompetent to confer such power upon a master with consequent lack of jurisdiction in the court to forbid its exertion.\n The investiture of a court with jurisdiction to review an order on the merits only upon the filing of a transcript exhibiting the Board's final action is not a denial of due process as suggested by counsel. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 486, 496]\n\u00a0\n We think the writs prayed are appropriate remedies in the circumstances disclosed. \n3\n The Circuit Court was without jurisdiction of the subject matter. If the Board had complied with the orders made, a hearing would have resulted respecting the legality of supposed action of the Board which was not in law or fact the final action, review of which the statute provides. No adequate remedy would be open to the Board by way of certiorari from the court's ultimate review of an order which the Board was authorized and desired to set aside.\n The expression in the return of readiness to vacate the order entered in the Circuit Court, if this court is of opinion that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction, renders the present issue of process supererogatory. Should the order not be vacated and occasion thus arise for the award of process, the clerk may issue it upon the order of a Justice of this Court.\n Decision for petitioner.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n The case is not here as if on writ of certiorari or appeal for review of error alleged to have been committed by the lower court. This is an application for the writs of mandamus and prohibition to command and restrain action by the judges named. These may not be granted unless the lower court was plainly without jurisdiction to hear and determine the case or the particular issue. In re New York & Porto Rico Steamship Co., \n155 \nU.S. 523, 531\n, 15 S.Ct. 183; Ex parte \n\n[304 \nU.S. 486, 497]\n\u00a0\n Oklahoma, \n220 \nU.S. 191, 208\n, 31 S.Ct. 426; Ex parte Chicago, R.I. & Pac. Ry., \n255 \nU.S. 273, 275\n, 41 S.Ct. 288, 289. Precisely, the question is whether, on the facts here disclosed, the court was without power to consider and decide upon the corporation's application for an order directing the Board to certify and file a transcript of the record and restraining in the meantime any other action by it. The decision just announced answers affirmatively, and that is the basis on which the Court commands vacation of the order of the lower court and prohibits it from reviewing the order of the Board without first giving it a reasonable opportunity to vacate its order; that is, without giving the Board more time to proceed under section 10(d), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(d). Obviously jurisdiction of the circuit court of appeals attached upon the filing of the corporation's petition for review and service of a copy on the Board. Any other construction of section 10(f), 29 U.S.C.A. s 160(f), would let the Board, by refusing to certify a transcript of proceedings before it, prevent judicial review of its orders. Congress did not so intend. While the statute expressly requires the person aggrieved to file a certified transcript, it impliedly, but not less plainly, commands the Board to certify the record. This Court's decision rests on the statement that, as the term is to be applied in this instance, jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine the controversy presented in a given set of circumstances. If the lower court had jurisdiction to entertain and decide the corporation's motion, writs of mandamus and prohibition may not be granted, for they are not available for correction of mere error or even abuse of discretion.

The corporation joined issue. Before it filed answer, hearings were held by the Board, from July 21 to July 24. After answer, there were hearins befor e an examiner at various times and places between August 9 and September 27. April 8, 1938, the Board made its decision and order. It found the corporation guilty of practices denounced by the act. It ordered it to cease and desist, to reinstate certain persons, to pay sufficient to equalize what certain persons would have earned if employed by the corporation during specified periods, less the amount they earned at other work during those periods.\n April 18, the corporation filed in the circuit court of appeals its petition to have the Board's order adjudged invalid. The petition charges that, in violation of the corporation's rights under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. amend. 5, the Board ordered the corporation to reinstate persons not alleged in the complaint to have been unlawfully discharged or discriminated against by the corporation; and so directed notwithstanding the corporation had never been accorded or offered a hearing or opportunity of making defense as to the asserted rights of those persons; that the Board made the order without affording the corporation opportunity to present its case by argument, orally or upon brief. It alleges that, under the terms of the order, about five thousand persons may claim reinstatement, petitioner is required to reinstate or pay them as specified, the average wage is $6.50 per day. And it asserts that to defer reinstatement, pending decision by the court as to validity of the order, would \n\n[304 \nU.S. 486, 499]\n\u00a0\n involve a risk of such magnitude as imminently to threaten its right to have review in court. And the petition avers that unless the order be stayed, irreparable injury and loss will result to the corporation and that it will be denied review of a substantial part of the order. It prays service of a copy on the Board. certification by the Board of the transcript as required by law, invalidation of the order, direction to the Board to dismiss its complaint, and a stay of the order and of proceedings by the Board to enforce it, excepting such as may be taken in court.\n April 18, the day on which the corporation filed petition for review, the Board, consistently with the corporation's claim as to its duty under the Act, agreed promptly to certify the transcript and to file it in court. April 22, the corporation filed an application for stay and temporary relief. Its application cited section 10(g), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(g), which declares that commencement of proceedings under section 10(f), 29 U.S.C.A .  160(f), shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the Board's order. It stated: The purpose of the application was to prevent irreparable loss and denial of review. If, pending final determination of the case, petitioner should fail to make reinstatements in accordance with the order, its potential weekly liability would exceed $ 95,000. On that basis the corporation sought suspension of the portion of the order that relates to reinstatement or payment of wages, so that, if it should be upheld, the corporation's liability to reinstate or to pay would commence ten days after the final decree of the court. In a brief submitted in support of its motion, the corporation maintained that the order is invalid because the corporation was not afforded a fair and full hearing and because the order is one for re-employment and not for reinstatement; and that unless the stay be granted, the corporation will suffer irreparable financial losses. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 486, 500]\n\u00a0\n April 30 the corporation's motion came on for hearing. The Board appeared and argued against it. The court neither granted nor denied the application. The rule to show cause, issued May 3, recites that at the hearing, April 30, the Board stated that it 'was seriously considering withdrawing, modifying or changing its order in the case and reopening same.' The Board's application for vacation of that order states that at the hearing on April 30 the Board advised the court that it was contemplating vacating its order, and wuld adv ise the court of its final position not later than May 4, 1938; that, on May 3, it notified the corporation that it had definitely decided to vacate the order; but that, before any steps to do so could be taken, the court had issued the restraining order. The Board maintained that as the transcript had not been filed, section 10(d), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(d), was applicable and that the Board then had the right to withdraw or vacate the order.\n In its answer to the rule to show cause, the Board says that it was not guilty of refusal to certify or of dilatory tactics, and that on April 18 its counsel informed the corporation's counsel that the Board would as promptly as possible prepare the record for certification. 'This task of considerable magnitude was forthwith commenced and was incomplete a week later when the supervening decision of the Supreme Court in Morgan v. United States, \n304 \nU.S. 1\n, 58 S.Ct. 773, 82 L.Ed. --, decided April 25, 1938, was rendered. ... There is no question in this case, therefore, whether the court had jurisdiction to require the Board to file a record when such filing has been long delayed or refused by the Board. The Board has with all promptness elected to exercise its power to vacate its order under section 10(d), and there is no merit in petitioner's claim that that section is inapplicable because the Board has evaded its obligations under the Act.'\n In these circumstances the court did not lack jurisdiction to hear and determine the controversy presented by \n\n[304 \nU.S. 486, 501]\n\u00a0\n the corporation's application for an order directing the Board to certify the record for filing in court. The act contemplates prompt action. Section 10(i), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(i) declares that petitions filed under it shall be heard expeditiously 'and if possible within ten days after they have been docketed.' Power under section 10(d) to change or vacate its order does not enable the Board to delay filing the record. At the bar counsel expressed the opinion that the Board may vacate an order without notice, section 10(d). It had fifteen days, April 18 to May 3, to decide whether to vacate the order or join issue. That period included a week before and a week after our decision in Morgan v. United States, supra. The Board does not claim that it needed until May 3 to certify the transcript. So the issue before the lower court was the very narrow one, whether for an unreasonable length of time the Board withheld the record. And that question involves consideration of subsidiary ones: To what extent, if at all, a certification may be delayed by the choice of the Board to enable it to consider modification or repeal of its order. Whether after decision in Morgan v. United States, supra, more than a reasonable time had elapsed. While there is room for difference of opinion on these questions, it is very hard to perceive on what ground it may be held that the court was without jurisdiction to decide them or even to conclude that the order was an arbitrary exertion of power, or that restraint against further delay by the Board involved an abuse of discretion.\n I am of opinion that the lower court had jurisdiction of the case and of the issues decided by the challenged order, and that therefore the Board's application for writs of mandamus and prohibition should be denied.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 49 Stat. 454, U.S.C., Supp. II, tit. 29,  160(d)(e)(f), 29 U.S.C.A .  160(d, e, f). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] '(d) Until a transcript of the record in a case shall have been filed in a court, as hereinafter provided, the Board may at any time, upon reasonable notice and in such manner as it shall deem proper, modify or set aside, in whole or in part, any finding or order made or issued by it.\n'(e) The Board shall have power to petition any circuit court of appeals ... for the enforcement of such order and for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order, and shall certify and file in the court a transcript of the entire record in the proceeding, including the pleadings and testimony upon which such order was entered and the findings and order of the Board.

The contract entitled the Association to $1,500 cash, and an additional $20,000 should the Supreme Court of Illinois find respondents exempt. The contract authorized the Association to retain petitioner Odell as attorney to prosecute the claimed exemption without cost to respondents for his services. Odell endorsed the contract between respondents and the Association with the statement: 'I hereby consent to retention under the terms of this agreement.' Under the contract respondents made payments-corresponding to their possible tax liabilities-into an Escrow Fund. Petitioners Odell and Harris, employed by the Association, and one Craig, deposited these payments pursuant to a letter1 to the Bank which declared that the funds deposited were not the property of either Odell, Harris or Craig, but were in their custody.\n The Supreme Court of Illinois decided respondents were liable for the tax, 2 and thereafter an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against the Association. Craig was willing but Odell and Harris refused to comply with respondents' request for the return of the payments \n\n[305 \nU.S. 160, 162]\n\u00a0\n they had made into the Fund, and respondents filed a petition for their recovery in the bankruptcy court. Petitioners consented and agreed in open court to an order of the bankruptcy court which required them to pay seventy-five per cent of the Fund ($242,000) to the State of Illinois in discharge of respondents' tax liability, and which also provided that 'the balance in said ... Fund ... shall remain and be held ... subject to the further order' of the bankruptcy court. It recited that petitioners 'agreed that (the bankruptcy court) had jurisdiction to enter this order.'\n Respondents then filed a second petition to recover an additional $48, 580.40 from the Fund, with $20,000 to remain 'subject to the further order of' the court. In answer to respondents' claim, the Bank and Craig disclaimed any interest in the Fund. The sole claim adverse to respondents was asserted by the receiver of the Association, for $20,000. Neither Odell nor Harris claimed any interest in the Fund. In response to the court's requests to answer, petitioners alleged that the court had no jurisdiction to determine rights relating to the Fund. After a hearing, the court found that it had jurisdiction and ordered petitioners to pay $ 48,580.40 from the Fund to respondents, the balance to remain 'subject to the further order of (the) ... Court ....' The following day the court ordered that petitioners' pleadings which challenged its jurisdiction over the $20,000 balance in the Fund be struck, and that petitioners answer within twenty days to the merits on respondents' claim to this balance.\n Petitioners did not answer, but appealed from both orders. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n A court of bankruptcy has jurisdiction to 'bring in and substitute additional persons or parties in proceedings in \n\n[305 \nU.S. 160, 163]\n\u00a0\n bankruptcy when necessary for the complete determination of a matter in controversy; (and to) cause the estates of bankrupts to be collected, reduced to money and distributed, and determine controversies in relation thereto,' with exceptions not here material. \n4\n This jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court extends to the determination of controversies relating to all property in the debtor's physical possession or in the hands of the debtor's agent at the time of the filing of a petition in bankruptcy. \n5\n In every case the bankruptcy court has power, in the first instance, to determine whether it has that actual or constructive possession which is essential to its jurisdiction to proceed. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Here, both courts below found that Harris and Odell were agents of the debtor (the Association) and had custody of the Escrow Fund as such agents at the time the petition in bankruptcy was filed and thereafter. We accept this finding. 7 and proceed to a consideration of the jurisdictional question. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioners controlled and had custody of this Fund as agents of the Association and did not assert any adverse interest in themselves. In the absence of a substantial adverse claim, the bankruptcy court acquired jurisdiction-when the petition in bankruptcy was filed-to de- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 160, 164]\n\u00a0\n termine controversies relating to the Fund,9 and had power by summary proceedings to compel its surrender. \n10\n Furthermore, petitioners consented and agreed in open court and respondents assented to the court's disposition of the Fund in a summary proceeding. Jurisdiction to try the issues was vested in the District Court sitting as a court of bankruptcy. Since the parties had only a procedural right to have these issues tried in a plenary suit, they were at liberty to waive this right. \n11\n Petitioners approved the first order which disposed of part of the Fund, and specifically provided that the balance remain 'subject to the further orders of' the District Court.\n All persons who created or had any possible interest in that portion of the Fund ordered distributed were parties and present in the bankruptcy court. No one of them-including petitioners-asserted or in any way indicated to the bankruptcy court that there could be any interest in the money distributed adverse to respondents. The sole claim adverse to respondents was that of the reeciver of the Association, for $20,000.

TERRITORY OF HAWAII(1938)\nNo. 94\nArgued: November 18, 1938Decided: December 5, 1938\n\n\n\n Mr. J. Garner Anthony, of Honolulu, Hawaii, for petitioners. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 306, 307]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Julius Russell Cades, of Honolulu, Hawaii, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 306, 308]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a Hawaiian corporation, is a common carrier of freight and passengers by water between different points in the Territory. A substantial part of its gross income is derived from transporting freight destined for trans-shipment to foreign or mainland ports. In 1913 a statute of the Territory created a Public Utilities Commission, prescribed its duties and levied a uniform semi-annual tax-denominated a fee1-upon all public utilities doing business in the Territory, partially to defray the Commission's expenses. Petitioner paid the tax until 1923, when it refused to make further payments, contending the tax could not validly be applied to it. In this suit, the Territory recovered judgment in the territorial court for the taxes assessed for the years 1923 to 1930, inclusive. The Supreme Court of Hawaii and the Circuit Court of Appeals both affirmed. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The Hawaiian 'Utilities Act of 1913,'3 under which the challenged taxes have been levied, invested the territorial Commission with broad powers to investigate all public utilities doing business in the Territory, with reference to the safety and accommodation of the public; safety, working hours and wages of employees; rates and fares; valuation; issuance of securities; amount and disposition of \n\n[305 \nU.S. 306, 309]\n\u00a0\n income; business relations with others; compliance with territorial and Federal laws and provisions of franchises, charters, and articles of association; regulations, practices and service; accidents, in connection with utility operations, believed by the Commission to require investigation and 'all matters of every nature affecting the relations and transactions between ... (such utilities) and the public, or persons, or corporations.' Rev.Laws Hawaii 1925,  2193\n\n\n This territorial Commission was empowered to make its investigations 'notwithstanding that the same may be within the jurisdiction of the interstate commerce commission, or within the jurisdiction of any Court or other body, and when after such examination the (territorial) commission shall be of the opinion that the circumstances warrant, it shall be its duty to effect the necessary relief or remedy by the institution and prosecution of appropriate proceedings or otherwise before the interstate commerce commission, or such court, or other body, in its own name or the name of the Territory, ....' Rev.Laws Hawaii 1925,  2201.\n The taxes in question accrued under Section 17 of the Act of 1913, Rev.Laws Hawaii 1925,  2207, providing that 'There shall ... be paid to the commission in each of the months of March and September in each year by each public utility which is subject to investigation by the Commission a fee which shall be equal to one-twentieth of one per cent. of the gross income from the public utility business carried on by such public utility in the Territory during the preceding year, plus one-fiftieth of one per cent. of the par value of the stock issued by such public utility and outstanding on December 31 of the preceding year, ....' After collection, the taxes 'shall be deposited in the treasury of the Territory to the credit of a special fund to be called the 'Public Utilities Commission Fund\" to be used-with any appropriations made available by the territorial legislature-to pay necessary expenses of the Commission in the performance of its duties under the Act. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 306, 310]\n\u00a0\n The Organic Act granting legislative power to the territorial government of Hawaii provides that 'the legislature shall not grant to any corporation, association, or individual any special or exclusive privilege, immunity, or franchise without the approval of Congress; ....'4 Pursuant to the Organic Act, and prior to the effective date of the Utilities Act of 1913, the territorial legislature passed Act 135 S.L.Haw.1913-to take effect upon the approval by Congress-providing that all public utilities previously granted franchises should 'be subject as to reasonableness of rates, prices and charges and in all other respects to the provisions of ... (the Utilities Act of 1913) and all amendments thereof for the regulation of public utilities in said Territory ....' March 28, 1916,5 Congress expressly ratified, approved and confirmed this Hawaiian Act 135.\n Act 135 as enacted by the Territory applied only to Hawaiian utilities specially described in the Act. However, Congress in ratifying and approving, broadened the Act by amendment so as to include not only the described utilities but 'all public utilities and public-utilities companies organized or operating within the Territory of Hawaii.' By further amendment Congress provided that nothing in Act 135 should 'limit the jurisdiction or powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission' and that all actions of the Hawaiian Public Utility Commission should 'be subject to review by the courts of the ... Territory.'\n September 7, 1916, Congress enacted the 'Shipping Act of 1916.'6 For the purposes of the Shipping Act, 'The term 'common carrier by water in interstate commerce\" was given a statutory definition to include \n\n[305 \nU.S. 306, 311]\n\u00a0\n 'a common carrier ... by water of passengers or property ... on regular routes from port to port between ...' places in the same 'Territory, District, or possession.' This Act created the United States Shipping Board, with broad powers to investigate and supersive carriers by water in foreign and interstate commerce as defined therein.\n We accept the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Hawaii that petitioner is a public utility as defined by the Hawaiian Act. \n7\n However, petitioner contends that the Territory cannot validly apply this tax to it. We have examined all of the grounds upon which this contention rests. None is sufficient to remove petitioner from the operation of the Utilities Act of 1913 as applied here.\n First. Petitioner contends that the passage of the Shipping Act by Congress completely ousted the territorial Commission of all jurisdiction over it in any respect, or for any purpose, and thus withdrew the Commission's power to collect the fees in question.\n The Supreme Court of Hawaii held in this case, as heretofore,8 that the Shipping Act did deprive the territorial Commission of authority, under the Act of 1913, to regulate by its own order the rates of this petitioner. In the present case, however, that court concluded that the Shipping Act did not withdraw the territorial Commission's power to investigate water carriers-such as petitioner-as to rates and other matters, either for the exercise of its own permitted supervisory powers or for presentation of the public's case before appropriate governmental bodies. \n9\n The territorial Act of 1913-to which Congress \n\n[305 \nU.S. 306, 312]\n\u00a0\n in 1916 subjected all utilities doing business in Hawaii-gave the territorial Commission jurisdiction over many matters other than rate regulation. In general, the Commission was empowered to supervise and regulate local properties and activities of utilities and to protect the public interest in relation to rates, operations, and many other phases of the utility business. While, insome instances, the Commission was powerless to enter any final order, nevertheless its authority to investigate and to appear before appropriate governmental agencies was designed as a part of a general plan to safeguard the public interest. The Shipping Act invested the Shipping Board with authority over some of these matters. But no language in that Act indicates that Congress intended to withdraw all of the territorial Commission's jurisdiction over territorial water carriers. While Congress had complete power to repeal the entire territorial Public Utilities Act, 'an intention to supersede the local law ( of a Territory) is not to be presumed, unless clearly expressed.' \n10\n Petitioner owns, controls, operates and man \n\n[305 \nU.S. 306, 313]\n\u00a0\n ages numerous steam vessels, wharfs, docks and real and personal property useful in the transportation of passengers and freight between the various ports and islands of Hawaii. Petitioner's gross income between the years 1922 and 1929 from business transacted in the Territory amounted to approximately $18,000,000. This Territory is located far from the mainland of the United States. Only clear and explicit statutory language could justify a holding that Congress intended by the Shipping Act to deprive the Territorial government of all jurisdiction over activities such as petitioner's, vitally affecting the trade, commerce, safety and welfare of the people of the Territory.\n We agree with the Supreme Court of Hawaii that the Shipping Act of 1916 did not wholly supersede the territorial Act of 1913 as applied to water carriers like petitioner, and did not take from the territorial Commission its power to investigate such utilities. A valid legislative power necessarily includes the right to provide funds to be expended in its exercise.\n Second. Petitioners contend, however, that the taxes involved constitute a burden on interstate and foreign commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution, U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3. But here, Congress, by its Act of 1916, subjected petitioner to the territorial law under which these very taxes were levied.\n Under the Constitution, Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce. \n11\n Therefore, assuming-but not deciding-that petitioner is engaged in interstate and foreign commerce, Congress has exercised its power in the present case by permitting the Territory to act \n\n[305 \nU.S. 306, 314]\n\u00a0\n upon this commerce by the imposition of the contested taxes. The imposition of these taxes under an Act to which Congress expressly subjected petitioner does not violate the Commerce Clause.\n Congress had the power to subject petitioner to this tax by virtue of its authority over the Territory, in addition to its power under the Commerce Clause. 'Congress may not only abrogate laws of the territorial legislatures, but it may itself legislate directly for the local government. It may make a void act of the territorial legislature valid, and a valid act void. In other words, it has full and complete legislative authority over the people of the territories, and all the departments of the territorial governments.' \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Third. Petitioner contends that the challenged tax is prohibited by the Fifth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. Amend 5, because 'no investigation, supervision, or regulation of petitioner was in fact made by the Commission.'\n A general tax designed to effectuate a plan for control and supervision of public utilities need not be apportioned among the taxpayers according to the actual services performed directly for each. Such a requirement would seriously impair the effective application and operation of general tax systems. Services performed by the Hawaiian Public Utilities Commission were for the benefit of the public as a whole and are not any the less services beneficial to petitioner because its business has not been given any special assistance. \n13\n 'A tax is not an assessment of benefits.' \n14\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cf., New York v.

Walsh and Jerome Walsh, both of Kansas City, Mo., for appellants.\n Messrs. James A. Reed and William S. Hogsett, both of Kansas City, Mo ., for appellees.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n This is a direct appeal to this Court from a decree of the District Court, three judges sitting, denying a motion to dismiss the complaint and granting an interlocutory injunction. The question arises whether such an appeal lies.\n Appellants rely upon the Act of August 24, 1937, c. 754, 50 Stat. 751, 28 U.S.C.A.  17, 349a, 380a and note, 401. Section 3 of that act, 28 U.S. C.A.  380a, the full text of which is quoted in the margin,1 provides that 'No interlocutory \n\n[304 \nU.S. 243, 245]\n\u00a0\n or permanent injunction suspending or restraining the enforcement, operation, or execution of, or setting aside, in whole or in part, any Act of Congress upon the ground that such Act or any part thereof is repugnant to the Consti- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 243, 246]\n\u00a0\n tution of the United States' shall be granted by a District Court 'unless the application for the same' shall be heard and determined by three judges. When there is an application for such an injunction, three judges are to be con- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 243, 247]\n\u00a0\n vened and the hearing of the application is to be expedited. An appeal may be taken directly to this Court from a decree 'granting or denying, after notice and hearing, an interlocutory or permanent injunction in such case.'\n We are of the opinion that the instant case does not fall within these provisions. This is not a suit to restrain the enforcement of an act of Congress, and no application was made for such an injunction.\n This suit was brought on July 5, 1937, by the appellees, Donnelly Garment Company and Donnelly Garment Sales Company, to obtain an injunction restraining the appellants, International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, its officers and agents, from committing certain acts alleged to be in furtherance of a conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1-7, 15 note, and the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, 15 U.S.C. c. 1,  12 et seq. The conduct sought to be restrained consisted of picketing, boycotting, and certain interferences with plaintiffs' business, their employees and customers. Appellee Donnelly Garment Workers' Union and its representatives were permitted to intervene and sought similar relief. Their petition in intervention alleged that the defendants (appellants) had not been and were not engaged in a labor dispute within the meaning of the Act of Congress of March 23, 1932, c. 90, 49 Stat. 70, known as the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  101 et seq., nor within the meaning of the Act of Congress of July 5, 1935, c. 372, 49 Stat. 449, known as the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., and that no labor dispute was involved in this litigation. They \n\n[304 \nU.S. 243, 248]\n\u00a0\n further stated that, 'if the actions and course of conduct of the defendants' were construed to be a 'labor dispute' within the meaning of those statutes, the latter would be unconstitutional, as so interpreted, because in contravention of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and of article 2, section 30, of the Constitution of the state of Missouri. By their amended bill of complaint, appellees, the original plaintiffs, made similar allegations as to the inapplicability of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and its invalidity if held applicable.\n On the presentation of the bill, the District Judge granted a temporary restraining order enjoining the defendants' conduct of which complaint was made. A motion to dissolve the restraining order and to dismiss the complaint was denied on August 13, 1937. D.C., 20 F.Supp. 767. After the passage of the Act of August 24, 1937, the District Judge certified to the Attorney General that the constitutionality of the Norris- LaGuardia Act and of the National Labor Relations Act had been 'drawn in question.' On the request of the District Judge, a court of three judges was constituted. The motion of the defendants to dismiss the bill and to vacate the temporary restraining order, and the motion of the plaintiffs for an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendants from committing the alleged unlawful acts in pursuance of a conspiracy in violation of the Anti-Trust Acts, were then heard. The motion to dismiss was denied and the interlocutory injunction was granted as prayed. 21 F.Supp. 807.\n There was no application before the District Court for an injunction restraining the enforcement of any act of Congress.In considering the application for an injunction restraining defendants from picketing, boycotting, etc., the District Court found that the ground of defense was the defendants' contention that the Norris-LaGuardia Act deprived the District Court of jurisdiction. The \n\n[304 \nU.S. 243, 249]\n\u00a0\n court held that that act had no application to the controversy, and that it was unnecessary to resolve the constitutional question presented as to its validity. 21 F.Supp. pages 811, 814.\n The Act of August 24, 1937, carefully distinguishes between the different situations to which its provisions are addressed. Section 1, 28 U.S.C.A.  401, applies 'whenever the constitutionality of any Act of Congress affecting the public interest is drawn in question' in any court of the United States in any suit or proceeding to which the United States, or its agency, officer, or employee, as such, is not a party. The fact that such a question is involved must be certified to the Attorney General and the United States must be permitted to intervene with all the rights of a party. To make that provision applicable it is enough that a question as to the constitutionality of an act of Congress is involved, however it may arise. The question may be raised by any party, and the section is not limited to cases where an injunction is sought to restrain the enforcement of the act. Apart from providing for intervention, and the right of the United States to present evidence and argument, section 1 does not require any change in procedure in the hearing of the cause or in relation to appeal.\n Section 2, 28 U.S.C.A.  349a, applies to a suit or proceeding in which the United States, or its agency, officer, or employee, as such, is a party, or in which the United States has intervened and in which 'the decision is against the constitutionality of any Act of Congress.' In that event, an appeal may be taken directly to this Court. That section applies, however the question of constitutionality may arise, provided the United States is or has become a party and the decision is against the validity of the act. That section does not require a court of three judges, and no provision is made for a direct appeal to this Court if the decision is in favor of the constitutionality of the act. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 243, 250]\n\u00a0\n The provision in section 3, 28 U.S.C.A.  380a, for a determination by three judges and for a direct appeal to this Court is limited to the particular class of cases there described. Section 3 does not provide for a case where the validity of an act of Congress is merely drawn in question, albeit that question be decided, but only for a case where there is an application for an interlocutory or permanent injunction to restrain the enforcement of an act of Congress. The careful choice of language in the different sections of the act points clearly to a distinction in categories. Had Congress intended the provision in section 3, for three judges and direct appeal, to apply whenever a question of the validity of an act of Congress became involved, Congress would naturally have used the familiar phrase 'drawn in question,' as in the first section of the act. While there are some variations in text, the provision in section 3 has a manifest analogy to that of section 266 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380, providing for three judges and a direct appeal to this court in case of an application for an injunction restraining the enforcement of a state statute by restraining the action of state officers. That provision is hinged on an application for injunction, and not on the mere drawing in question of the constitutionality of a state enactment. Compare Smith v. Wilson, \n273 \nU.S. 388, 391\n, 47 S.Ct. 385, 386; Stratton v. St. Louis Southwestern Rwy. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 10, 15\n, 51 S.Ct. 8.\n The entire procedure prescribed in section 3 turns on the presentation of an application for an injunction to restrain the enforcement of a federal statute. It is when 'such application' is presented to a judge that the particiat ion of two other judges is to be requested. It is 'such application' which is not to be heard or determined before at least five days' notice to the Attorney General. The judge to whom 'the application is made' may grant a temporary restraining order, and the court 'at the time of hearing such application' may continue the temporary stay. And it is the hearing 'upon any such application \n\n[304 \nU.S. 243, 251]\n\u00a0\n for an interlocutory or permanent injunction' that is to be given precedence and expedited. Appeal is to be taken directly to this Court where the decree grants or denies 'an interlocutory or permanent injunction in such case.'\n The contention of plaintiffs that the Norris-LaGuardia Act was not applicable to the conduct of defendants and would be invalid if otherwise interpreted was but an anticipation of a defense and did not constitute an application for injunction in any proper sense of the term as used in section 3. The only application for an injunction was one to restrain the defendants from committing acts in pursuance of the alleged conspiracy in violation of the Anti-Trust Acts. The statute did not require a decision by three judges upon that application or authorize a direct appeal to this Court.\n But although the merits cannot be reviewed here, this Court, by virtue of its appellate jurisdiction in cases of decrees purporting to be entered under the Act of August 24, 1937, as in cases of decrees purporting to be entered under section 266 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. A.  380, necessarily has jurisdiction to determine whether the court below has acted within the authority conferred by the statute and to make such corrective order as may be appropriate to the enforcement of the limitations which the statute imposes. We have said that such a case is analogous to those in which this Court, finding that the court below has acted without jurisdiction, exercises its appellate jurisdiction to correct the improper action. Gully v. Interstate Natural Gas Co., \n292 \nU.S. 16, 18\n, 54 S.Ct. 565, 566; Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., \n292 \nU.S. 386, 392\n, 54 S.Ct. 732, 734; Wall v. McNee, \n296 \nU.S. 547\n, 56 S.Ct. 177; United States v. Corrick, \n298 \nU.S. 435, 440\n, 56 S.Ct. 829. As appellants by mistakenly appealing directly to this Court have lost their opportunity to have the decree reviewed on its merits, as the time for appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals has expired, our \n\n[304 \nU.S. 243, 252]\n\u00a0\n appropriate action, without passing upon the merits, is to vacate the decree below and to remand the cause to the District Court for further proceedings to be taken independently of section 3 of the Act of August 24, 1937, 28 U.S.C.A.  380a. Gully v. United States Natural Gas Co., supra; Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., supra. It is so ordered.\n Decree vacated, and cause remanded.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The first three sections of the Act of August 24, 1937, 28 U.S.C.A .  401, 349a, 380a, are as follows:\n'Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That whenever the constitutionality of any Act of Congress affecting the public interest is drawn in question in any court of the United States in any suit or proceeding to which the United States, or any agency thereof, or any officer or employee thereof, as such officer or employee, is not a party, the court having jurisdiction of the suit or proceeding shall \n\n certify such fact to the Attorney General. In any such case the court shall permit the United States to intervene and become a party for presentation of evidence (if evidence is otherwise receivable in such suit or proceeding) and argument upon the question of the constitutionality of such Act. In any such suit or proceeding the United States shall, subject to the applicable provisions of law, have all the rights of a party and the liabilities of a party as to court costs to the extent necessary for a proper presentation f the facts and law relating to the constitutionality of such Act.\n'Sec. 2. In any suit or proceeding in any court of the United States to which the United States or any agency thereof, or any officer or employee thereof, as such officer or employee, is a party, or in which the United States has intervened and become a party, and in which the decision is against the constitutionality of any Act of Congress, an appeal may be taken directly to the Supreme Court of the United States by the United States or any other party to such suit or proceeding upon application therefor or notice thereof within thirty days after the entry of a final or interlocutory judgment, decree, or order; and in the event that any such appeal is taken, any appeal or cross-appeal by any party to the suit or proceeding taken previously, or taken within sixty days after notice of an appeal under this section, shall also be or be treated as taken directly to the Supreme Court of the United States. In the event that an appeal is taken under this section, the record shall be made up and the case docketed in the Supreme Court of the United States within sixty days from the time such appeal is allowed, under such rules as may be prescribed by the proper courts. Appeals under this section shall be heard by the Supreme Court of the United States at the earliest possible time and shall take precedence over all other matters not of a like character. This section shall not be construed to be in derogation of any right of direct appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States under existing provisions of law.\n\n'Sec. 3. No interlocutory or permanent injunction suspending or restraining the enforcement, operation, or execution of, or setting aside, in whole or in part, any Act of Congress upon the ground that such Act or any part thereof is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States shall be issued or granted by any district court of \n\n the United States, or by any judge thereof, or by any circuit judge acting as district judge, unless the application for the same shall be presented to a circuit or district judge, and shall be heard and determined by three judges, of whom at least one shall be a circuit judge. When any such application is presented to a judge, he shall immediately request the senior circuit judge (or in his absence, the presiding circuit judge) of the circuit in which such district court is located to designate two other judges to participate in hearing and determining such application. It shall be the duty of the senior circuit judge or the presiding circuit judge, as the case may be, to designate immediately two other judges from such circuit for such purpose, and it shall be the duty of the judges so designated to participate in such hearing and determination. Such application shall not be heard or determined before at least five days' notice of the hearing has been given to the Attorney General and to such other persons as may be defendants in the suit: Provided, That if of opinion that irreparable loss or damage would result to the petitioner unless a temporary restraining order is granted, the judge to whom the application is made may grant such temporary restraining order at any time before the hearing and determination of the application, but such temporary restraining order shall remain in force only until such hearing and determination upon notice as aforesaid, and such temporary restraining order shall contain a specific finding, based upon evidence submitted to the court making the order and identified by reference thereto, that such irreparable loss or damage would result to the petitioner and specifying the nature of the loss or damage. The said court may, at the time of hearing such application, upon a like finding, continue the temporary stay or suspension, in whole or in part, until decision upon the application. The hearing upon any such application for an interlocutory or permanent injunction shall be given precedence and shall be in every way expedited and be assigned for a hearing at the earliest practicable day. n appeal may be taken directly to the Supreme Court of the United States upon application therefor or notice thereof within thirty days after the entry of the order, decree, or judgment granting or denying, after notice and hearing, an interlocutory or permanent injunction in such case. In the event that an appeal is taken under this section, \n the record shall be made up and the case docketed in the Supreme Court of the United States within sixty days from the time such appeal is allowed, under such rules as may be prescribed by the proper courts. Appeals under this section shall be heard by the Supreme Court of the United States at the earliest possible time and shall take precedence over all other matters not of a like character.

U.S.(1938)\nNo. 709\nArgued: Decided: April 25, 1938\n\n\n\n Decided April 25, 1938\n\n\n Appeals from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Texas.\n Mr. George S. Wright, of Dallas, Tex., for appellants Interstate Circuit and others.\n Thomas D. Thacher, of New York City, for appellants Paramount Picture Distributing Co. and others.\n Mr. Robert H. Jackson, Sol. Gen., for the United States.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n The Government brought this suit for an injunction against the carrying out of an alleged conspiracy, in restraint of interstate commerce, between distributors and exhibitors of motion picture films. The restraint was alleged to consist in provisions in license agreements which prevented any 'feature picture' of the distributors, which had been shown 'first- run' in a theater of the defendant exhibitor at an admission price of 40 cents or more, from thereafter being exhibited in the same locality at an admission price of less than 25 cents or on the same program with another feature picture. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 55, 56]\n\u00a0\n The evidence was presented by an agreed statement of certain facts and by oral testimony on behalf of each party. The District Court entered a final decree adjudging that in making the restrictive agreements the distributors had engaged in a conspiracy with the exhibitor, Interstate Circuit, Inc., and its officers in violation of the Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S. C.A.  1 et seq., and granting a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the restrictions. 20 F.Supp. 868. The case comes here on direct appeal. Acts of Feb. 11, 1903, c. 544, 32 Stat. 823, as amended 15 U.S.C.A.  28, 29; February 13, 1925, c. 229,  1, 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U. S.C.A.  345.\n Equity Rule 70 1\/2, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723, provides: 'In deciding suits in equity, including those required to be heard before three judges, the court of first instance shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon; ...\n'Such findings and conclusions shall be entered of record and, if an appeal is taken from the decree, shall be included by the clerk in the record which is certified to the appellate court under rules 75 and 76.'\n\n The District Court did not comply with this rule. The court made no formal findings. The court did not find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law as the rule required. The statements in the decree that in making the restrictive agreements the parties had engaged in an illegal conspiracy were not ultimate conclusions and did not dispense with the necessity of properly formulating the underlying findings of fact.\n The opinion of the court was not a substitute for the required findings. A discussion of portions of the evidence and the court's reasoning in its opinion do not constitute the special and formal findings by which it is the duty of the court appropriately and specifically to determine all the issues which the case presents. This is an essential aid to the appellate court in reviewing an equity case, Railroad Commission v. Maxcy, \n281 \nU.S. 82\n, 50 S.Ct. 228, and cases \n\n[304 \nU.S. 55, 57]\n\u00a0\n cited, and compliance with the rule is particularly important in an anti- trust case which comes to this Court by direct appeal from the trial court.\n The Government contends that the distributors were parties to a common plan constituting a conspiracy in restraint of commerce; that each distributor would benefit by unanimous action, whereas otherwise the restrictions would probably injure the distributors who imposed them, and that prudence dictated that 'no distributor agree to impose the restrictions in the absence of agreement or understanding that his fellows would do likewise'; that the restraints were unreasonable, and that they had the purpose and effect of raising and maintaining the level of admission prices; that even if the distributors acted independently and not as participants in a joint undertaking, still the restraints were unreasonable in their effect upon the exhibitor's competitors.\n Appellants, asserting copyright privileges, contend that the restrictions were reasonable; that they were intended simply to protect the licensee from what would otherwise be an unreasonable interference by the distributors with the enjoyment of the granted right of exhibition; that there was no combination or conspiracy among the distributors; that it was to the independent advantage of each distributor to impose the restrictions in its own agreement and that the contention that less than substantially unanimous action would have injured the distributors in making such agreements was contrary to the evidence; and that the restrictions did not have an injurious effect.\n We intimate no opinion upon any of the questions raised by these rival contentions, but they point the importance of special and adequate findings in accordance with the prescribed equity practice.\n The decree of the District Court is set aside, and the cause is remanded, with directions to the court to state \n\n[304 \nU.S. 55, 58]\n\u00a0\n its findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by Equity Rule 70 1\/2, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723.\n It is so ordered.\n Decree set aside, and cause remanded.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice BLACK think that the findings in the opinion and decree below, while informal, are sufficient for purposes of decision, and that the case should therefore be decided now without further proceedings below; the more so because of the public interest involved.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJ. D. ADAMS MFG. CO. v. STOREN(1938)\nNo. 641\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 308]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederick E. Matson and Harry T. Ice, both of Indianapolis, Ind., for appellant.\n Messrs. A. J. Stevenson, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Joseph P. McNamara, Deputy Atty. Gen., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case we are called upon to determine whether the Indiana Gross Income Tax Act of 1933,1 as construed and applied, burdens interstate commerce and impairs the obligation of contract in contravention of article 1, sections 8 and 10, of the Constitutio o f the United States.\n Section 1 declares that the phrase 'gross income' as used in the Act means, inter alia, gross receipts derived from trades, businesses, or commerce, and receipts from investment of capital, including interest. Section 2 imposes a tax ascertained by the application of specified rates to the gross income of every resident of the State and the gross income of every nonresident derived from sources within the State. Section 6 exempts 'So much of such gross income as is derived from business conducted in commerce between this state and other states of the United States, or between this state and foreign countries, to the extent to which the State of Indiana is prohibited from taxing under the Constitution of the United States of America.'\n The appellant, an Indiana corporation, manufactures road machinery and equipment and maintains its home office, principal place of business, and factory in the State. It sells 80 per cent. of its products to customers \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 309]\n\u00a0\n in other states and foreign countries upon orders taken subject to approval at the home office. Shipments are made from the factory and payments are remitted to the home office. Pursuant to a practice of investing surplus funds not immediately required in its business, the appellant owns and receives interest upon bonds and notes of Indiana municipal corporations which, at the time they were issued, were declared by statute to be exempt from taxation.\n Upon the adoption of the Act, the appellant filed a petition in a State circuit court in which, after reciting these facts, it alleged that the appellees were demanding that it report and pay taxes upon income received in interstate and foreign commerce and income received as interest upon securities exempted from taxation by the State law and that these demands, together with penalties specified in the statute for failure to make return and pay the tax, would be enforced unless prevented by the judgment of the court. The prayer was for a declaratory judgment that the Act, as construed and applied by the appellees, is unconstitutional. After issue joined the facts were stipulated and the court made findings and entered a judgment in favor of the appellant. The Supreme Court of Indiana reversed the judgment holding that the tax demanded does not unconstitutionally burden the interstate commerce in which appellant is engaged and does not impair the obligation of any contract of the State exempting municipal securities from taxation. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n 1. \nWill the threatened imposition of the tax on the gross income from the appellant's sales in interstate commerce contravene article 1, section 8, of the Constitution, which reposes in Congress power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce?\n The title of the Act declares that it is a revenue measure imposing a tax upon 'the receipt of gross income.' \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 310]\n\u00a0\n The statute defines gross income as meaning the gross receipts derived from trades, businesses, or commerce. The Supreme Court of Indiana in its opinion states: 'The statute here under consideration levies a tax upon all who are domiciled within the state, based upon the privilege of domicile, and transacting business, and receiving gross income, within the state, and measured by the amount of gross income.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The tax is not an excise for the privilege of domicile alone, since it is levied upon the gross income of nonresidents from sources within the State. Nor is it for the transaction of business since in many instances it hits the receipt of income by one who conducts no business. It is not a charter fee or a franchise fee measured by the value of goods manufactured or the amount of sales such as the State would be competent to demand from domestic or foreign corporations for the privilege conferred. \n4\n It is not an excise upon the privieg e of producing or manufacturing within the State, measured by volume of production or the amount of sales. \n5\n It is not a tax in lieu of ad valorem taxes upon property, which would be inoffensive to the commerce clause,6 since the appellant pays local and state taxes upon its property within the State and it appears that these, as respects appellant and others similarly situated, have not been reduced. The Act, moreover, is silent as to the tax being in lieu of property taxes. The opinion of the Supreme Court suggests that the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 311]\n\u00a0\n statute was adopted as part of a scheme for the reduction of local property taxes and the substitution of a gross income tax but, as appellant points out, provision for reduction of property taxes was made by legislation passed in 1932.7\n The regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury, pursuant to authority granted by the Act, treat the exaction as a gross receipts tax;8 and the Attorney General says in his brief that it is a privilege tax upon the receipt of gross income. We think this a correct description.\n We conclude that the tax is what it purports to be-a tax upon gross receipts from commerce. Appellant's sales to customers in other states and abroad are interstate and foreign commerce. The Act, as construed, imposes a tax of one per cent. on every dollar received from these sales.\n The vice of the statute as applied to receipts from interstate sales is that the tax includes in its measure, without apportionment, receipts derived from activities in interstate commerce; and that the exaction is of such a character that if lawful it may in substance be laid to the fullest extent by states in which the goods are sold as well as those in which they are manufactured. Interstate commerce would thus be subjected to the risk of a double tax burden to which intrastate commerce is not exposed, and which the commerce clause forbids. \n9\n We have repeatedly held that such a tax is a regulation of, and a burden upon, interstate commerce prohibited by article 1, section 8, of the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 312]\n\u00a0\n Constitution. \n10\n The opinion of the State Supreme Court stresses the generality and nondiscriminatory character of the exaction but it is settled that this will not save the tax if it directly burdens interstate commerce. \n 11\n\u00a0\n\n The State court and the appellees rely strongly upon American Manufacturing Company v. St. Louis, \n250 \nU.S. 459\n, 39 S.Ct. 522, as supporting the tax on appellant's total gross receipts derived from commerce with citizens of the State and those of other states or foreign countries. But that case dealt with a municipal license fee for pursuing the occupation of a manufacturer in St. Louis. The exaction was not an excise laid upon the taxpayer's sales or upon the income derived from sales. The tax on the privilege for the ensuing year was measured by a percentage of the past year's sales. \n12\n The taxpayer had during the preceding year removed some of the goods manufactured to a warehouse in another state and, upon sale, delivered them from the warehouse. It contended that the city was without power to include these sales in the measure of the tax for the coming year. The court held, however, that the tax was upon the privilege of manufacturing \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 313]\n\u00a0\n within the state and it was permissible to measure the tax by the sales price of the goods produced rather than by their value at the date of manufacture. If the tax there city consideration had been a sales tax the city could not have measured it by sales consummated in another state. That the tax in the present case is not a tax on the manufacture but a tax on gross sales, is evident from the regulations promulgated pursuant to the Act and confirmed by an amendment of the state adopted in 1937 under which, if the appellant had shipped its products to another state and thence sold them (as did the American Manufacturing Company), the receipts from the sales would be exempt from the gross income reached by the Act. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n So far as the sale price of the goods sold in interstate commerce includes compensation for a purely intrastate activity, the manufacture of the goods sold, it may be reached for local taxation by a tax on the privilege of manufacturing, measured by the value of the goods manufactured,14 or by other permissible forms of levy upon \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 314]\n\u00a0\n the intrastate transaction. \n15\n It is because the tax, forbidden as to interstate commerce, reaches indiscriminately and without apportionment, the gross compensation for both interstate commerce and intrastate activities that it must fail in its entirety so far as applied t r eceipts from sales interstate.\n We hold that, as respects the appellant's sales of its manufactured product in interstate and foreign commerce, the statute cannot constitutionally be enforced.\n\n 2. \nWill the imposition of the tax in respect of interest on the bonds of Indiana municipalities violate article 1, section 10, of the Constitution of the United States?\n By an Act of March 9, 1903, entitled 'An Act to exempt from taxation all bonds, notes and other evidences of interest-bearing debt issued by the State or by municipal corporations,' it was provided: 'That all bonds, notes and other evidences of indebtedness hereafter issued by the State of Indiana or by municipal corporations within the State upon which the said State or the said municipal corporations pay interest shall be exempt from taxation.' \n16\n By an Act of March 11, 1919, tax laws of the State were codified and the Act of 1903 was incorporated without change as clause twentieth of section 5 of the codification. \n17\n The section has since been amended but the twentieth clause remained unchanged at the date of the passage of the Gross Income Tax Act of 1933\n\n\n The appellant insists that the exemption granted in the Acts of 1903 and 1919 constitutes a contract with purchasers of municipal securities the obligation of which is unconstitutionally impaired by the attempt to tax the interest they yield. The State replies that the Acts were \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 315]\n\u00a0\n not intended to create a contract and did not in fact do so, but that if they did, the covenant did not embrace interest payable on municipal obligations but only ad valorem taxation upon them.\n When the exemption laws were adopted the State had no income tax law. Whatever may have been the background against which the Act of 1903 is to be construed, its setting, as a portion of the tax codification of 1919, is significant. The latter deals with two forms of taxation-poll taxes and property taxes. It embodies a comprehensive scheme of annual assessment of real and personal property of individuals, partnerships, and corporations, including public utilities; makes provision for a return by taxpayers of complete inventories of property and, in the case of corporations, of the excess value of capital stock and surplus and of the value of franchises or privileges enjoyed; and provides for assessment by public officials for the purpose of the application of a rate ad valorem by various public bodies. The statute has nothing to say with respect to license, occupation, privilege or other excise taxes. In section 25 it provides that: 'Where bonds or stocks are now or may hereafter be exempted from taxation, the accrued interest on such bonds or dividends on such stocks shall be listed and assessed, unless otherwise exempted, without regard to the time when the same is to be paid.' Thus the legislature distinguished between the bonds themselves and the interest accrued upon them as separate subjects of assessment and ad valorem taxation. The Supreme Court of Indiana has consistently held that exemptions from taxation are not favored but are to be strictly construed. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n In the light of the foregoing facts we are of opinion that the case is controlled by Hale v. Iowa State Board, \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 316]\n\u00a0\n \n302 \nU.S. 95\n, 58 S.Ct. 102. We are unable, therefore, to hold that the decision of the Supreme Court is plainly wrong, even upon the assumption that in adopting the statutory exemption the legislature intended to, and in fact did, contract with purchasers of municipal bonds.\n As respects the tax demanded on appellant's gross income from its business in interstate commerce, the judgment is reversed and, as respects the tax on interest received from obligations issued by municipalities of the State, the judgment is affirmed. The cause will be remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n So ordered.\n Reversed in part and affirmed in part.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the challenged judgment should be reversed in toto.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting, in part.\n The Indiana statute of 1933 here invalidated imposes 'a tax, measured by the amount or volume of gross income, ... upon ... all residents of the State of Indiana, and upon the gross income derived from sources within the State of Indiana, of all persons and ... companies, ... who are not residents of ... Indiana, but are engaged in business in this state.' Acts Ind.1933, c. 50,  2. The tax is general in effect throughout the entire State, applying to all who do business and who receive annual incomes in the State above $1,000 (with minor exceptions). It falls uniformly upon all such gross incomes whether derived from interstate or intrastate business or from investments, interest or services. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 317]\n\u00a0\n There is no contention that the statute was inspired by any spirit of antagonism or hostility to interstate commerce or that it discriminates against interstate commerce in amount or method of application.\n Concurrently with the passage of this Revenue Act, the Indiana legislature limited the tax that could be imposed upon other forms of property by the State or any 'taxing units within the state.' \n2\n The Supreme Court of Indiana in the opinion below3 said. 'Legislative history indicates that one of the purposes of the Gross Income Tax Law was to redistribute governmental burdens and relieve property of a tax burden which was thought to be too great.' Indiana passed this gross income tax law at a time when depressed economic conditions were causing the fiscal policies of many States to turn toward similar legislation. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 318]\n\u00a0\n Serious financial difficulties of the States stimulated efforts to find new sources of taxation, andthe widespread belief that property was bearing an unfair burden of taxes also substantially contributed to the levying of these new taxes. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 319]\n\u00a0\n Appellant is an Indiana corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling road machinery. All of the machinery is manufactured in Indiana. Its office, only plant and all its properties are located in Indiana. Its products are sold to ultimate purchasers in Indiana and other States by independent distributors or through sales agents of appellant. All sales must be approved by, and all payments made to appellant's office in Indiana. While appellant is thus engaged in interstate commerce, obviously, a major portion of its activities takes place in Indiana.\n The prevailing judgment here is that Indiana cannot constitutionally impose this tax measured by the gross income received by appellant in Indiana from that substantial part of its products (manufactured in Indiana) sold to purchasers in other States. It is held that the tax, thus applied, is prohibited by section 8, article 1 of the Federal Constitution, which provides that: 'The Congress shall have Power ... to regulate Commerce ... among the several states ....'\n The Indiana tax is not invalidated on the ground that it violates any law passed by Congress under this constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce.\n This power to regulate commerce among the States 'like all others vested in Congress, is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the Constitution.' 6 \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 320]\n\u00a0\n The question, therefore, is whether-in the absence of regulatory legislation by Congress condemning state taxes on gross receipts from interstate commerce-the commerce clause, of itself, prohibits all such state taxes, as 'regulations' of interstate commerce, even though general, uniform and nondiscriminatory.\n All state taxes on gross receipts from interstate commerce do not discriminate against, or impose extraordinary burdens upon, that commerce. Those that do not, do no more than impose a normal burden of government upon that commerce. On the other hand, some state gross income taxes may be designed or applied so as seriously to impede the freedom of interstate commerce. If interstate commerce should be so impeded, Congress might- under its commerce power-find it 'necessary and proper' to condemn all state taxes on gross receipts, in order to 'carry into execution' its granted power to regulate and protect interstate commerce. \n7\n We are not here confronted with such a congressional enactment. Should the Indiana law, and all state taxes on gross receipts from interstate commerce, as such-in the absence of such enactment-be condemned as a regulation of interstate commerce in the constitutional sense?\n'Texation' and 'regulation' are not synonymous; all state, county or city taxes that affect interstate commerce do not 'regulate' it in the constitutional sense; unquestionably, taxes can be levied for revenue only. As pointed out by Mr. Justice Holmes in Galveston, Harrisburg, etc., Railway Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 225\n, 28 S.Ct. 638, involving a state tax which was not general but was levied only on gross receipts laid on railroads (page 639): 'It being once admitted, as of course it must be, that not every law that affects commerce among the states is a \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 321]\n\u00a0\n regulation of it in a constitutional sense, nice distinctions are to be expected.' The majority there found that the tax on interstate transportation violated the Commerce Clause. The dissent, applying the similar principle that every gross receipts tax is not necessarily a regulation, insisted that the particular gross receipts tax involved did not 'attempt to regulate commerce among the states' and should not 'be taken as a tax on interstate commerce in the sense of the Constitution; for its operation on interstate commerce is only incidental, not direct.' Both opinions recognized a distinction between taxes for revenue, which incidentally affect interstate commerce, and other taxes which directly regulate commerce. More recently, this Court has said in Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, \n303 \nU.S. 250\n, 58 S.Ct. 546, 550: 'Recognizing that not every local law that affects commerce is a regulation of it in a constitutional sense, this Court has held that local taxes may be laid on property used in the commerce; that its value for taxation may include the augmentation attributable to the commerce in which it is employed; and, finally, that the equivalent of that value may be computed by a measure related to gross receipts when a tax of the latter is substituted for a tax of the former.' \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 322]\n\u00a0\n Many cases relied on to support the prevailing judgment here hold that state gross receipts taxes imposed on interstate 'transportation' violate the Commerce Clause, While this construction of the Commerce Clause had been previously considered, it was fully clarified and delimited in Philadelphia & S. Mail Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326, 341\n, 342 S., 344, 345, 7 S.Ct. 1118, and that decision has served as the authoritative basis for subsequent decisions (page 1122):\n\n'The tax in the present case is laid upon the gross receipts for transportation as such. Those receipts are followed, and caused to be accounted for by the company dollar for dollar. It is those specific receipts, or the amount thereof, (which is the same thing,) for which the company is called upon to pay the tax. They are taxed, not only because they are money or its value, but because they were received for transportation. No doubt a ship-owner, like any other citizen, may be personally taxed for the amount of his property or estate, without regard to the source from which it was derived, whether from commerce or banking or any other employment. But that is an entirely different thing from laying a special tax upon his receipts in a particular employment. ...\n\n'It (the tax under consideration) is not a general tax on the incomes of all the inhabitants of the state, but a special tax on transportation companies. Conceding, however, that an income tax may be imposed on certain classes of the community, distinguished by the character of their occupations, this is not an income tax on the class to which it refers, but a tax on their receipts for transportation. ... It is clearly not such, but a tax on transportation only.' (Italics supplied.) \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 323]\n\u00a0\n Previous decisions had held that the Commerce Clause did not prohibit state taxes on gross receipts from interstate commerce. \n9\n The effect of these prior decisions was modified by the Philadelphia & S. Mail Steamship Co. Case. The latter case decided (contrary to the previous decisions) that a state tax on gross receipts received for actual interstate transportation is prohibited by the Commerce Clause. In that case the tax invalidated was a selective \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 324]\n\u00a0\n tax applied to the particular business of transportation. Consequently, the Court did not decide whether a state could constitutionally impose a general gross income tax (such as Indiana's) to an interstate business ( such as appellant's) not involving transportation. Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292\n, 38 S.Ct. 126, December, 1917, and United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321\n, 38 S.Ct. 499, Ann.Cas.1918E, 748, June, 1918, marked the all-inclusive condemnation of state taxes on gross receipts from interstate commerce, as a class-without regard to discrimination or generality.\n\n However, as pointed out in the opinion, (page 127) the 'bare question' in the Crew Levick Case was 'whether a state tax imposed upon the business of selling goods in foreign commerce, in so far as it is measured by the gross receipts from merchandise shipped to foreign countries, is in effect a regulation of foreign commerce or an impost upon exports, within the meaning of the pertinent clauses of the Federal Constitution.' The tax there involved was not a general income tax bearing uniformly upon all business within the State. When the opinion in the United States Glue Co. Case-where a gross income tax was not in issue- indicated approval of an extension of the previous constitutional rule so as to condemn-as a class-all state taxes on gross receipts from interstate commerce, the Court clearly set out its reasons for the extension. The Court said that the distinction (page 501): '... between a tax measured by gross receipts and one measured by net income, recognized by our decisions, is manifest and substantial, and it affords a convenient and workable basis of distinction between a direct and immediate burden upon the business affected and a charge that is only indirect and incidental. A tax upon gross receipts affects each transaction in proportion to its magnitude and irrespective of whether it is profitable or otherwise. Conceivably it may be sufficient to make the difference between profit and loss, or to so diminish the profit \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 325]\n\u00a0\n as to impede or discourage the conduct of the commerce. A tax upon the net profits has not the same deterrent effect, since it does not arise at all unless a gain is shown over and above expenses and losses, and the tax cannot be heavy unless the profits are large. Such a tax, when imposed upon net incomes from whatever source arising, is but a method of distributing the cost of government, like a tax upon property, or upon franchises treated as property; and if there be no discrimination against interstate commerce, either in the admeasurement of the tax or in the means adopted for enforcing it, it constitutes one of the ordinary and general burdens of government, from which persons and corporations otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the states are not exempted by the Federal Constitution because they happen to be engaged in commerce among the states.'\n A tax upon property used in interstate commerce, even with an augmented value due to such use, is not a regulation of commerce, is valid and is within the powers of the state. \n10\n Yet, the constitutional validity of a tax on property does not turn upon whether the property is profitable to its owner.Gr oss receipts from interstate commerce-as from all sources- vary and will probably rise and fall with property values. Therefore, the total amount exacted from interstate commerce under a gross receipts tax can fluctuate just as the total paid under a property tax. Since property and corporate franchises used in interstate commerce can be constitutionally taxed by States, whether profitable or unprofitable, it seems difficult to justify a constitutional test for state income taxes based upon existence or absence of profit.\n The application of such a constitutional test will-as a practical matter-inevitably result in exempting all \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 326]\n\u00a0\n enterprises engaged in interstate commerce from all state gross income taxes on interstate commerce receipts, whether profitable or not. At the same time, local intrastate enterprises, doing business in the same communities, must pay state gross receipts taxes whether profitable or unprofitable. Such a construction of the Commerce Clause-designed to prevent a State from imposing unfair tax burdens upon those engaged in interstate commerce-actually serves to impose an unfair and discriminatory burden upon local intrastate business. Failure of an interstate business to make a profit does not relieve the State of its burden in affording protection for that business. While the Federal government is charged with the constitutional duty of protecting and fostering interstate commerce by proper regulation11 it has not attempted to provide local governmental protection for those engaged in such commerce. However desirable it may be, as a tax policy, to tax in accordance with ability to pay, the failure to make a profit should not of itself create a constitutional exemption from a tax which the State might otherwise impose. \n12\n And, as a practical matter, state taxing authorities may be moved by the consideration that profits are not always capable of ascertainment with complete accuracy and certainty. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 327]\n\u00a0\n It has been suggested, however, that Indiana might by law apportion to itself that part of a tax on gross receipts from interstate commerce to which it is entitled. Such an apportionment by Indiana woul, in effect, fix the portion of such a tax for the other forty-seven States which appellant's interstate business might touch. Indiana has no authority to determine what, how, when or to what extent other States may tax within their respective boundaries. If such power of apportionment or allocation exists at all, it must be true that the only repository of a power touching complex and national aspects of interstate commerce is not Indiana, not the Judiciary-but the National Congress.\n Interstate commerce constitutes a large part of the business of the nation. Until Congress, in the exercise of its plenary power over interstate commerce, fixes a different policy, it would appear desirable that the States should remain free to adopt tax systems imposing uniform and nondiscriminatory taxes upon interstate and intrastate business alike.\n It also urged that a gross receipts tax under the Commerce Clause is invalid because it might result in multiple burdens on interstate commerce. 14 The possibility is suggested that the States may use gross income taxes to \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 328]\n\u00a0\n create direct, extraordinary, and unjust burdens upon interstate commerce and that this possibility requires that all state taxes on gross interstate commerce receipts be condemned as within the prohibition of the Commerce Clause. Congress was undoubtedly given the exclusive power to regulate commerce in order that undue, unjust and unfair burdens might not be imposed upon such commerce. \n15\n It was not intended, however, that interstate commerce should enjoy a preferred status over intrastate business or to remove those engaged in interstate commerce from the ordinary and usual burdens of the government which affords such commerce protection. \n16\n A court may act to protect a litigant from unfair and unjust burdens upon the litigant's interstate business. Yet, it would seem that only Congress has the power to formulate rules, regulations and laws to protect interstate commerce from merely possible future unfair burdens. Here the record does not indicate any charge or proof of an existing extraordinary, unfair or multiple tax burden on appellant. The tax burden from which appellant is here exempted is one which the local taxpayers of Indiana must bear. As a result, an unjust and unfair burden is actually imposed upon intrastate business, because of an apprehension of a possible future injury to interstate commerce. The control of future conduct, the prevention of future injuries and the formulation of regulatory rules in the fields of commerce and taxation, all present legislative problems.\n This Court has sustained, and the majority opinion refers approvingly to a municipal license tax in Missouri, imposed in addition to an ad valorem property tax, in which the amount of the license was measured by the amount received for the interstate sale of goods manu- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 329]\n\u00a0\n factured within the municipality. 17 It is true that the amount of the license for a succeeding year was there measured by a percentage of the amount of sales for the preceding year, while the Indiana tax is paid quarterly during the year of sale. However, if we look to substance and effect, disregard the nominal designation of each tax, and consider the realities of the two taxes, the tax burdens are identical under the approved Missouri tax and the disapproved Indiana tax. \n18\n Numerous other decisions have recognized the principle of including receipts from interstate commerce in the figure (not wholly derived from such commerce) used in measuring the amount of a state excise tax. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n It has been often said that no formula can be devised for determining in all cases whether or not a state tax is prohibited by the Commerce Clause, and that 'the question is inherently a practical one, depending for its decision on the special facts of each case ....'20 A formula which arbitrarily stamps every state gross receipts tax as a violation of the Commerce Clause, on the ground that it can be used for cumulative tax purposes, leaves unanswered the possibility that other taxes, previously held valid, may be used with like effects on interstate commerce; disregards the fact that in many cases, as here, \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 330]\n\u00a0\n such a tax can be fairly and uniformly applied to both interstate and intrastate commerce; and in effect actually denies a State the privilege of using such a tax unless willing to impose unjust and unequal burdens upon its own citizens engaged in intrastate commerce.\n The receipt of income is a taxable event and need not necessarily enjoy the immunity of the income's source. \n21\n Appellant's receipt of gross income could be taxed in one State only, because appellant received income only in Indiana. A sales tax might possibly be imposed upon independent distributors of appellant's products who do business in other States. Such tax would be constitutional only if it did not discriminate against appellant's products. 22 Distributors in States other than Indiana do \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 331]\n\u00a0\n business under the protection of their respective States. Under these circumstances, nondiscriminatory sales taxes in those States upon the distributors create no unfair multiplication of taxes and would not be unconstitutional. \n23\n The manufacturer who receives protection under the laws of Indiana and the distributors who receive protection under the laws of the States in which products are sold, should be subject to uniform, nondiscriminatory taxes imposed by the sovereign power of the States in which both do business under State protection.\n Judicial interpretation of the Commerce Clause gradually evolved the principle that nonaction by Congress is tantamount to a congressional declaration that the flow of commerce from State to State must be free from unfair and discriminatory burdens. \n24\n Throughout the decisions upon the question has run recognition of the supreme power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, and the courts have stricken down state taxes when found to raise barriers impeding the free flow of commerce between the States, but not obstructing commerce between citizens within a single State. Courts-in the absence of congressional regulation of interstate commerce-have acted because there '... would otherwise be no security against conflicting regulations of different States, each discriminating in favor of its own products and citizens, and against the products and citizens of other States. ... it is a matter of public history that the object \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 332]\n\u00a0\n of vesting in Congress the right to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the States was to insure uniformity of regulation against conflicting and discriminating State legislation.' \n25\n With reference to borderline laws, it has been significantly pointed out that there '... is also, in addition to the restraint which those provisions (the Commerce Clause) impose by their own force on the State, the unquestioned power of Congress, under the authority to regulate commerce among the States, to interpose, by the exercise of this power, in such a manner as to prevent the State from any oppressive interference with the free interchange of commodities by the citizens of one State with those of another.' \n26\n\u00a0\n\n If it be true, as urged, that some state gross receipts taxes may possibly in the future be multiplied so as to burden interstate commerce unfairly, it is equally true that other state gross receipts taxes (as the Indiana tax) may not, in the absence of such multiplication, result in such burdens. Since the present litigation has developed that no such unfair burdens have been imposed upon appellant's interstate business, appellant can only be exempted from payment of this tax by application of a regulatory rule or law which condemns all such state taxes-whether fair or unfair. If such a general rule or law is to be promulgated it would seem that under our constitutional division of governmental powers such a regulatory policy should be considered and determined by Congress under its exclusive grant. It will be time enough for judicial protection when a litigant actually proves, in a particular case, that state gross receipts taxes levied against the litigant have resulted in unfai a nd unjust discrimination against the litigant because of engagement \n\n[304 \nU.S. 307, 333]\n\u00a0\n in interstate commerce. Many arguments-which we might believe to be sound- can be advanced against the legislative policy of a gross receipts tax. These objections, however, are not the criterion of its constitutionality. With the wisdom of such fiscal policy of a State we are not concerned. \n27\n The interests of interstate commerce will best be fostered, preserved and protected-in the absence of direct regulation by the Congress-by leaving those engaged in it in the various States subject to the ordinary and nondiscriminatory taxes of the States from which they receive governmental protection. For these reasons I believe that the entire judgment of the court below should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Indiana Acts 1933, c. 50, Ind.Stat.Ann., Burns',  64-2601 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 7 N.E.2d 941, 944. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Compare Miles v.

Coupled with a drastic shrinkage in assessed valuations and a demand for increased state aid to localities, this made it imperative for the state government to seek new revenue sources even though the other tax yields had been holding up fairly well through 1931-32. ...\n'It is evident that the local tax situation was the chief factor bringing about the sweeping change in the state's own system. For one not intimately acquainted with conditions in Indiana it is not easy to locate from the available data the precise sources of trouble, but whatever they may have been, the tax limitation law crystallized them, and the result is a threatened breakdown of governmental finance in many localities, unless the state succeeds in carrying out its greatly increased program of aid to localities through highway and school moneys. ...\n\n'The campaign in support of the (gross receipts) tax ... was led by the Indiana Farm Bureau, which secured the signatures of a large number of farmers on a petition urging the passage of a sales tax.

Tuttle, of Atlanta, Ga., for petitioner.\n Mr. Bates Booth, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, while imprisoned in a federal penitentiary, was denied habeas corpus by the District Court. \n1\n Later, \n\n[304 \nU.S. 458, 459]\n\u00a0\n that court granted petitioner a second hearing, prompted by 'the peculiar circumstances surrounding the case and the desire of the court to afford opportunity to present any additional facts and views which petitioner desired to present.' Upon consideration of the second petition, the court found that it did 'not substantially differ from the' first, 'and for the reasons stated in the decision in that case' the second petition was also denied.\n Petitioner is serving sentence under a conviction in a United States District Court for possessing and uttering counterfeit money. It appears from the opinion of the District Judge denying habeas corpus that he believed petitioner was deprived, in the trial court, of his constitutional right under the provision of the Sixth Amendment, U.S.C.A. Const.Amend. 6, that, 'In all criminal prosecutions,the acc used shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.' \n2\n However, he held that proceedings depriving petitioner of his constitutional right to assistance of counsel were not sufficient 'to make the trial void and justify its annulment in a habeas corpus proceeding, but that they constituted trial errors or irregularities which could only be corrected on appeal.'\n The Court of Appeals affirmed3, and we granted certiorari due to the importance of the questions involved. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The record discloses that:\n Petitioner and one Bridwell were arrested in Charleston, S.C., November 21, 1934, charged with \n\n[304 \nU.S. 458, 460]\n\u00a0\n feloniously uttering and passing four counterfeit twenty-dollar Federal Reserve notes and possessing twenty-one such notes. Both were then enlisted men in the United States Marine Corps, on leave. They were bound over to await action of the United States Grand July, but were kept in jail due to inability to give bail. January 21, 1935, they were indicted; January 23, 1935, they were taken to court and there first give notice of the indictment; immediately were arraigned, tried, convicted, and sentenced that day to four and one-half years in the penitentiary; and January 25, were transported to the Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta. While counsel had represented them in the preliminary hearings before the commissioner in which they-some two months before their trial-were bound over to the Grand Jury, the accused were unable to employ counsel for their trial. Upon arraignment, both pleaded not guilty, said that they had no lawyer, and-in response to an inquiry of the court-stated that they were ready for trial. They were then tried, convicted, and sentenced, without assistance of counsel.\n'Both petitioners lived in distant cities of other states and neither had relatives, friends, or acquaintances in Charleston. Both had little education and were without funds. They testified that they had never been guilty of nor charged with any offense before, and there was no evidence in rebuttal of these statements.' \n5\n In the habeas corpus hearing, petitioner's evidence developed that no request was directed to the trial judge to appoint counsel, but that such request was made to the District Attorney, who replied that in the state of trial (South Carolina) the court did not appoint counsel unless the defendant was charged with a capital crime. The District Attorney denied that petitioner made request \n\n[304 \nU.S. 458, 461]\n\u00a0\n to him for counsel or that he had indicated petitioner had no right to Counsel. The Assistant District Attorney testified that Bridwell 'cross examined the witnesses;' and, in his opinion, displayed more knowledge of procedure than the normal layman would possess. He did not recall whether Bridwill addressed the jury or not, but the clerk of the trial court testified 'that Mr. Johnson (Bridwell?) conducted his defense about as well as the average layman usually does in cases of a similar nature.' Concerning what he said to the jury and his cross-examination of witnesses, Bridwell testified: 'I tried to speak to the jury after the evidence was in during my trial over in the Eastern District of South Carolina. I told the jury, 'I don't consider myself a hoodlum as the District Attorney has made me out several times.' I told the jury that I was not a native of New York as the District Attorney stated, but was from Mississippi and only stationed for overnme nt service in New York. I only said fifteen or twenty words. I said I didn't think I was a hoodlum and could not have been one of very long standing because they didn't keep them in the Marine Corps.\n\n'I objected to one witness' testimony. I didn't ask him any questions, I only objected to his whole testimony. After the prosecuting attorney was finished with the witness, he said, 'Your witness,' and I got up and objected to the testimony on the grounds that it was all false, and the Trial Judge said any objection I had I would have to bring proof or disproof.'\n\n Reviewing the evidence on the petition for habeas corpus, the District Court said6 that, after trial, petitioner and Johnson '... were remanded to jail, where they asked the jailer to call a lawyer for them, but were not permitted to contact one. They did not, however, undertake to get any message to the judge. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 458, 462]\n\u00a0\n '... January 25th, they were transported by automobile to the Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta, Ga., arriving ... the same day.\n'There, as is the custom, they were placed in isolation and so kept for sixteen days without being permitted to communicate with any one except the officers of the institution, but they did see the officers daily. They were no request of the officers to be permitted to see a lawyer, nor did they ask the officers to present to the trial judge a motion for new trial or application for appeal or notice that they desired to move for a new trial or to take an appeal.\n\n'On May 15, 1935, petitioners filed applications for appeal which were denied because filed too late.'\n\n The '... time for filing a motion for new trial and for taking an appeal has been limited to three and five days.' \n7\n\u00a0\n\n One. The Sixth Amendment guarantees that: 'In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.' This is one of the safeguards of the Sixth Amendment deemed necessary to insure fundamental human rights of life and liberty. Omitted from the Constitution as originally adopted, provisions of this and other Amendments were submitted by the first Congress convened under that Constitution as essential barriers against arbitrary or unjust deprivation of human rights. The Sixth Amendment stands as a constant admonition that if the constitutional safeguards it provides be lost, justice will not 'still be done.' \n8\n It embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth that the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to protect \n\n[304 \nU.S. 458, 463]\n\u00a0\n himself when brought before a tribunal with power to take his life or liberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned counsel. That which is simple, orderly, and necessary to the lawyer-to the untrained layman-may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious. Consistently with the wise policy of the Sixth Amendment and other parts of our fundamental charter, this Court has pointed to '... the humane policy of the modern criminal law ...' which now provides that a defendant '... if he be poor, ... may have counsel furnished him by the state, ... not infrequently ... more able than the attorney for the state.' \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The '... right to be heard would be, in many cases, of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and educated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If charged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself wheter the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of evidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a proper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence irrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to prepare his defence, even though he have a perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him.' \n10\n The Sixth Amendment withholds from federal courts,11 in all criminal proceedings, the power and authority to deprive an accused of his life or liberty unless he has or waives the assistance of counsel. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 458, 464]\n\u00a0\n Two. There is insistence here that petitioner waived this constitutional right. The District Court did not so find. It has been pointed out that 'courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver' of fundamental constitutional rights12 and that we 'do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.' \n13\n A waiver is ordinarily an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege. The determination of whether there has been an intelligent waiver of right to counsel must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\n Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276\n, 50 S.Ct. 253, 70 A.L.R. 263, decided that an accused may, under certain circumstances, consent to a jury of eleven and waive the right to trial and verdict by a constitutional jury of twelve men. The question of waiver was there considered on direct appeal from the conviction, and not by collateral attack on habeas corpus. However, that decision may be helpful in indicating how, and in that manner, an accused may-before his trial results in final judgment and conviction-waive the right to assistance of counsel. The Patton Case noted approvingly a state court decision14 pointing out that the humane policy of modern criminal law had altered conditions which had existed in the 'days when the accused could not testify in his own behalf, (and) was not furnished counsel,' and which had made it possible to convict a man when he was 'without money, without counsel, without ability to summon witnesses, and not permitted to tell his own story ....' \n\n[304 \nU.S. 458, 465]\n\u00a0\n The constitutional right of an accused to be represented by counsel invokes, of itself, the protection of a trial court, in which the accused- whose life or liberty is at stake-is without counsel. This protecting duty imposes the serious and weighty responsibility upon the trial judge of determining whether there is an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused. While an accused may waive the right to counsel, whether there is a proper waiver should be clearly determined by the trial court, and it would be fitting and appropriate for that determination to appear upon the record.\n Three. The District Court, holding petitioner could not obtain relief by habeas corpus, said: 'It is unfortunate, if petitioners lost their right to a new trial through their ignorance or negligence, but such misfortune cannot give this court jurisdiction in a habeas corpus case to review and correct the errors complained of.'\n The purpose of the constitutional guaranty of a right to counsel is to protect an accused from conviction resulting from his own ignorance of his legal and constitutional rights, and the guaranty would be nullified by a determination that an accused's ignorant failure to claim his rights removes the protection of the Constitution. True, habeas corpus cannot be used as a means of reviewing errors of law and irregularities-not involving the question of jurisdiction-occurring during the course of trial;15 and the 'writ of habeas corpus cannot be used as a writ of error.' 16 These principles, however, must be construed and applied so as to preserve-not destroy-constitutional safeguards of human life and liberty. The scope of inquiry in habeas corpus proceedings has been broadened-not narrowed-since the adoption of the Sixth \n\n[304 \nU.S. 458, 466]\n\u00a0\n Amendment. In such a proceeding, 'it would be clearly erroneous to confine the inquiry to the proceedings and judgment of the trial court' 17 and the petitioned court has 'power to inquire with regard to the jurisdiction of the inferior court, either in respect to the subject-matter or to the person, even if such inquiry (involves) an examination of facts outside of, but not inconsistent with, the record.' \n18\n Congress has expanded the rights of a petitioner for habeas corpus19 and the '... effect is to substitute for the bare legal review that seems to have been the limit of judicial authority under the common-law practice, and under the act of 31 Car. II, chap. 2, a more searching investigation, in which the applicant is put upon his oath to set forth the truth of the matter respecting the causes of his detention, and the court, upon determining the actual facts, is to 'dispose of the party as law and justice require.'\n'There being no doubt of the authority of the Congress to thus liberalize the common-law procedure on habeas corpus in order to safeguard the liberty of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States against infringement through any violation of the Constitution or a law or treaty established thereunder, it results that under the sections cited a prisoner in custody pursuant to the final judgment of a state court of criminal jurisdiction may have a judicial inquiry in a court of the United States into the very truth and substance of the causes of his detention, although it may become necessary to look behind and beyond the record of his conviction to a sufficient extent to test the jurisdiction of the state court to proceed to judgment against him. ... \n\n[304 \nU.S. 458, 467]\n\u00a0\n '... it is open to the courts of the United States, upon an application for a writ of habeas corpus, to look beyond forms and inquiry into the very substance of the matter ....'20\n\n Petitioner, convicted and sentenced without the assistance of counsel, contends that he was ignorant of his right to counsel, and incapable of preserving his legal and constitutional rights during trial. Urging that- after conviction-he was unable to obtain a lawyer; was ignorant of the proceedings to obtain new trial or appeal and the time limits governing both; and that he did not possess the requisite skill or knowledge properly to conduct an appeal, he says that it was-as a practical matter- impossible for him to obtain relief by appeal. If these contentions be true in fact, it necesarily f ollows that no legal procedural remedy is available to grant relief for a violation of constitutional rights, unless the courts protect petitioner's rights by habeas corpus. Of the contention that the law provides no effective remedy for such a deprivation of rights affecting life and liberty it may well be said-as in Mooney v. Holohan, \n294 \nU.S. 103, 113\n, 55 S.Ct. 340, 342, 98 A.L.R. 406-that it 'falls with the premise.' To deprive a citizen of his only effective remedy would not only be contrary to the 'rudimentary demands of justice' 21 but destructive of a constitutional guaranty specifically designed to prevent injustice.\n Since the Sixth Amendment constitutionally entitles one charged with crime to the assistance of counsel, compliance with this constitutional mandate is an essential jurisdictional prerequisite to a federal court's authority to deprive an accused of his life or liberty. When this \n\n[304 \nU.S. 458, 468]\n\u00a0\n right is properly waived, the assistance of counsel is no longer a necessary element of the court's jurisdiction to proceed to conviction and sentence. If the accused, however, is not represented by counsel and has not competently and intelligently waived his constitutional right, the Sixth Amendment stands as a jurisdictional bar to a valid conviction and sentence depriving him of his life or his liberty. A court's jurisdiction at the hearing of trial may be lost 'in the course of the proceedings' due to failure to complete the court-as the Sixth Amendment requires-by providing counsel for an accused who is unable to obtain counsel, who has not intelligently waived this constitutional guaranty, and whose life or liberty is at stake. \n22\n If this requirement of the Sixth Amendment is not complied with, the court no longer has jurisdiction to proceed. The judgment of conviction pronounced by a court without jurisdiction is void, and one imprisoned thereunder may obtain release by habeas corpus. \n23\n A judge of the United States-to whom a petition for habeas corpus is addressed-should be alert to examine 'the facts for himself when if true as alleged they make the trial absolutely void.' \n24\n\u00a0\n\n It must be remembered, however, that a judgment cannot be lightly set aside by collateral attack, even on habeas corpus. When collaterally attacked, the judgment of a court carries with it a presumption of regularity. \n25\n Where a defendant, without counsel, acquiesces in a trial resulting in his conviction and later seeks release by the extraordinary remedy of habeas corpus, the burden of proof rests upon him to establish that he did not competently and intelligently waive his constitutional \n\n[304 \nU.S. 458, 469]\n\u00a0\n right to assistance of Counsel. If in a habeas corpus hearing, he does meet this burden and convinces the court by a preponderance of evidence that he neither had counsel nor properly waived his constitutional right to counsel, it is the duty of the court to grant the writ.\n In this case, petitioner was convicted without enjoying the assistance of counsel. Believing habeas corpus was not an available remedy, the District Court below made no findings as to waiver by petitioner. In this state of the record we deem it necessary to remand the cause. If-on remand-the District Court finds from all of the evidence that petitioner has sustained the burden of proof resting upon him and that he did not competently and intelligently waive his right to counsel, it will follow that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to proceed to judgment and conviction of petitioner, and he will therefore be entitled to have his petition granted. If petitioner fails to sustain this burden he is not entitled to the writ.\n The cause is reversed and remanded to the District Court for action in harmony with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice REED concurs in the reversal.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER is of the opinion that the record shows that petitioner waived the right to have counsel, that the trial court had jurisdiction, and that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Bridwell v.

UNITED STATES(1938)\nNo. 61\nArgued: Decided: January 31, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank R. Serri, of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Wm. S. Culbertson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Golden W. Bell, Asst. Sol. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner was convicted of violations of section 8(a)1 and (e)2 of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933. Act of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n June 13, 1933, c. 64, 48 Stat. 128, 134, amended by Act of April 27, 1934, c. 168,  12, 48 Stat. 643, 647, 12 U.S.C.  1467(a) and (e), 12 U.S.C.A.  1467(a, e). The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the conviction, 89 F.2d 19, and because of the importance of the questions presented certiorari was granted. \n301 \nU.S. 679\n, 57 S.Ct. 943\n\n\n The conviction was upon eight counts of the indictment, viz., counts 5 and 15 under section 8(a) and counts 8, 12, 14, 20, 24, and 25 under section 8(e). To count 12 petitioner had pleaded guilty, but later was permitted to withdraw that plea, pleaded not guilty, and went to trial. On count 8, imposition of sentence was suspended and petitioner was placed upon probation. On the remaining seven counts, petitioner was sentenced to a year and a day in prison, the sentences to run concurrently.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals refused to consider errors arising on the bill of exceptions, as it had not been settled and filed within the time permitted by Rule 9 of the Criminal Appeals Rules, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723a. The court accordingly limited its consideration to the sufficiency of the indictment, entertaining and deciding the questions of the constitutional validity of the Home Owners' Loan Act and of the provisions of section 8(a) and (e) in particular.\n The Government contends that the convictions should be sustained, irrespective of questions of the validity of any part of the statute, upon the ground that, the sentences being concurrent, the judgment should be affirmed if good under any one of the counts. In that view, the Government submits that petitioner consented to the judgment on count 12. The point is that petitioner was permitted to withdraw her plea of guilty to that count, although eleven days had intervened, while Rule 2(4) of the Criminal Appeals Rules, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723a, requires such a motion to be made within ten days. The Government argues that the provision of the rule is mandatory and hence the judgment, as one upon consent, should be \n\n[303 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n affirmed without consideration of the merits. Petitioner answers that the Government by going to trial is now estopped to raise the question, and, further, that a plea of guilty does not prevent the defendant from challenging the sufficiency of the indictment. 2 Bishop on Criminal Procedure, 2d Ed.,  795. The point does not appear to have been raised either in the District Court or in the Court of Appeals and it is based solely upon the dates of certain entries in the criminal docket without any supporting proof. We are not disposed to deal with a question of that importance presented in this manner.\n First.-As to the counts under section 8(a).3-Counts 5 and 15, under that provision, charge that petitioner, being the holder of a second mortgage upon certain premises, in executing the consent to accept bonds of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation in full settlement, and for the purpose of influencing the action of the Corporation, knowingly and falsely stated that her claims were respectively in the sums of $590 and $ 650, whereas in fact they were respectively only in the sums of $285 and $ 150.\n Petitioner argues that there is no allegation that a loan to the owner was made or approved, or that any payment was made to petitioner; that the second mortgagee's consent is temporary and may be withdrawn; that it is not under oath; and that there is no warranty of the truth of the information given. Petitioner argues, further, that any statement in the consent of a second mortgagee as to the balance due cannot endanger or directly influence any loan made by the Corporation; that the second mortgagee is not an applicant; and that the practice in such cases negatives Reliance on the consent, as the essential factors are the value of the property, as to which the Corporation makes its appraisal, and the earning capacity of the owner. None of these arguments is impressive. It does not lie with one knowingly making \n\n[303 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n false statements with intent to mislead the officials of the Corporation to say that the statements were not influential or the information not important. There can be no question that Congress was entitled to require that the information be given in good faith and not falsely with intent to mislead. Whether or not the Corporation would act favorably on the loan is not a matter which concerns one seeking to deceive by false information. The case is not one of an action for damages but of criminal liability, and actual damage is not an ingredient of the offense.\n Petitioner's main argument is that the whole scheme of the statute is invalid; that Congress had no constitutional authority to create the Home Owners' Loan Corporation-to provide for the conduct of a business enterprise of that character. There is no occasion to consider this broad question as petitioner is not entitled to raise it. When one undertakes to cheat the Government or to mislead its offcers, or those acting under its authority, by false statements, he has no standing to assert that the operations of the Government in which the effort to cheat or mislead is made are without constitutional sanction.\n We recently dealt with a similar contention that the false claims statute, Criminal Code,  35, as amended, 18 U.S.C.A.  80, did not apply to a conspiracy to cheat the United States by false representations in connection with operations under a statute which this Court found to be unconstitutional. We said that such a construction was inadmissible. 'It might as well be said that one could embezzle moneys in the United States Treasury with impunity if it turns out that they were collected in the course of invalid transactions. ... Congress was entitled to protect the government against those who would swindle it regardless of questions of constitutional authority as to the operations that the government is conducting. Such questions cannot be raised by those who make false claims \n\n[303 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n against the government'. United States v. Kapp, \n302 \nU.S. 214\n, 58 S.Ct. 182, 184, decided December 6, 1937; Madden v. United States, 1 Cir., 80 F.2d 672. While the instant case is not one of conspiracy to obtain money from the United States, but one of false statements designed to mislead those acting under authority of the Government, the principle involved is the same. Apart from any question of the validity of the other provisions of the Home Owners' Loan Act, Congress was entitled to secure protection against false and misleading representations while the act was being administered, and the separability provision of the act, section 9, 12 U.S.C.A.  1468, is clearly applicable. Utah Power Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165, 184\n, 52 S.Ct. 548, 553.\n There is the further argument that the provision of section 8(a), separately considered, offends the due process clause as being vague and uncertain. We find no merit in that contention. The statute defining the crime is sufficiently explicit.\n Second.-As to the counts under section 8(e).4-The Government points out that count 14 is based on the statute as it was originally enacted in 1933. That count charges that petitioner on or about April 1, 1934, made a contract with an applicant for a loan for the payment to petitioner of a certain sum for services in connection with the loan, and that the contract was not for 'an ordinary charge or fee authorized and required by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation for services actually rendered for examination and perfection of title, appraisal, and like necessary services.'\n Counts 12, 20, 24, and 25, under the statute as amended, charge that petitioner in or about June, July, and September, 1934, made similar contracts for the payment of unauthorized charges.\n It appears that the board of directors in January, 1934, specifically provided that 'The ordinary charges author- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n ized and required' for services should consist of: (1) An appraisal fee as approved by the board; (2) a fee for a character report; (3) necessary recording and similar fees; (4) necessary charges for perfecting title in a sum not exceeding $75 in any case and larger necessary charges if approved by the board; (5) necessary and usual fees for abstracts, examination of title, opinions, certificates of title, or title insurance; ( 6) charges of attorneys or title companies for escrow services or closing loans; and (7) any other necessary charge for like necessary services as specifically approved by the board.\n Section 8(e) is also separable from the other provisions of the statute. It is plainly designed to prevent the exploitation of applicants. It rests upon the same principle as that which underlies section 8(a) as to false and misleading representations to the officials of the Corporation. Congress was entitled not only to prevent misapplication of the public funds and to protect the officials concerned from being misled, but also to protect those who sought loans from being imposed upon by extravagant or improper charges for services in connection with their applications. This would be in the interest 'not only of themselves and their families but of the public.' See Yeiser v. Dysart, \n267 \nU.S. 540, 541\n, 45 S.Ct. 399, 400; Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502, 535\n, 536 S., 54 S.Ct. 505, 515, 89 A.L.R. 1469. Authority to penalize such exploitation while the enterprise is being conducted cannot be regarded as dependent upon the validity of the general plan. That plan might or might not be assailed. If assailed, a long period might elapse before final decision. Meanwhile, the governmental operations go on, and public funds and public transactions require the protection which it was the aim of these penal provisions to secure, whatever might be the ultimate determination as to the validity of the enterprise. United States v. Kapp, supra.\n As a separable provision, the validity of section 8(e) is challenged as lacking the requisite definiteness under the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n due process clause. Section 8(e), as amended in 1934, omitted the words 'in connection with a loan by the Corporation or an exchange of bonds or cash advance under this Act' which were in the original provision. But the context in the amended section, sufficiently shows that the forbidden charges are those in connection with applications 'for a loan, whether bond or cash.' The resolution adopted by the board of directors sets forth the nature of the ordinary charges that 'are authorized and required,' and the power of Congress to provide for such action by the Board is not open to question. See United States v. Grimaud, \n220 \nU.S. 506, 521\n, 31 S.Ct. 480; United States v. Shreveport Grain Co., \n287 \nU.S. 77, 85\n, 53 S. Ct. 42, 44. The phrase 'like necessary services' in the section describes services which are cognate to those mentioned in the preceding clause 'for examinaton and perfection of title' and appraisal.' And the resolution of the board, after stating the categories of authorized charges, provides for 'any other necessary charge for like necessary services, as specifically approved by the Board of Directors.' We think that the statute sets up an ascertainable standard and is 'sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties.' Connally v. General Construction Co., \n269 \nU.S. 385, 391\n, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127; United States ex rel. Handler v. Hill, 3 Cir., 90 F.2d 573, 574. Compare Old Dearborn Co. v. Seagram Corporation, \n299 \nU.S. 183, 196\n, 57 S. Ct. 139, 145, 106 A.L.R. 1476.\n Third.-We have considered the objections to the indictment which were open in the absence of a bill of exceptions. The Circuit Court of Appeals rightly held that the bill of exceptions was not settled and filed in time under the rule. But its decision was rendered before our decision in Ray v. United States, \n301 \nU.S. 158\n, 57 S.Ct. 700, construing Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeals Rules, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723a. See, also, Forte v. United States, \n302 \nU.S. 220\n, 58 S.Ct. 180, decided December 6, 1937. That rule gives to the Circuit Court of Appeals full supervision and control of the proceedings on appeal, 'including the proceed- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n ings relating to the preparation of the record on appeal.' The appellate court, in the exercise of its sound discretion, has authority to provide for the correction of any miscarriage of justice in connection with any action of the trial judge relating to the settlement and filing of a bill of exceptions.\n As the Circuit Court of Appeals may have proceeded in this case upon the assumption that it had no power to approve the settlement and filing of the bill of exceptions and to pass upon the rulings it disclosed, its judgment will be vacated and the cause will be remanded so that the appellate court may be free to exercise its discretion in that relation. It is so ordered.\n Remanded.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 8(a) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C.  1467(a), 12 U.S.C.A.  1467(a), is as follows: 'Sec. 8.

National Biscuit Co. \n305 \nU.S. 111\n (1938) ]\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 111, 113]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas D. Thacher and W. H. Crichton Clarke, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. David A. Reed, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the federal court for Delaware1 by National Biscuit Company against Kellogg Company to enjoin alleged unfair competition by the manufacture and sale of the breakfast food commonly known as shredded wheat. The competition was alleged to be unfair mainly because Kellogg Company uses, like the plaintiff, the name shredded wheat and, like the plaintiff, produces its biscuit in pillow-shaped form.\n Shredded wheat is a product composed of whole wheat which has been boiled, partially dried, then drawn or pressed out into thin shreds and baked. The shredded wheat biscuit generally known is pillow-shaped in form. It was introduced in 1893 by Henry D. Perky, of Colo- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 111, 114]\n\u00a0\n rado; and he was connected until his death in 1908 with companies formed to make and market the article. Commercial success was not attained until the Natural Food Company built, in 1901, a large factory at Niagara Falls, New York. In 1908, its corporate name was changed to 'The Shredded Wheat Company'; and in 1930 its business and goodwill were acquired by National Biscuit Company.\n Kellogg Company has been in the business of manufacturing breakfast food cereals since its organization in 1905. For a period commencing in 1912 and ending in 1919 it made a product whose form was somewhat like the product in question, but whose manufacture was different, the wheat being reduced to a dough before being pressed into shreds. For a short period in 1922 it manufactured the article in question. In 1927, it resumed manufacturing the product. In 1928, the plaintiff sued for alleged unfair competition two dealers in Kellogg shredded wheat biscuits. That suit was discontinued by stipulation in 1930. On June 11, 1932, the present suit was brought. Much evidence was introduced; but the determinative facts are relatively few; and as to most of these there is no conflict.\n In 1935, the District Court dismissed the bill. It found that the name 'Shredded Wheat' is a term describing alike the product of the plaintiff and of the defendant; and that no passing off or deception had been shown. It held that upon the expiration of the Perky patent No. 548, 086 issued October 15, 1895, the name of the patented article passed into the public domain. In 1936, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decree. Upon rehearing, it vacated, in 1937, its own decree and reversed that of the District Court, with direction 'to enter a decree enjoining the defendant from the use of the name 'Shredded Wheat' as its trade-name and from advertising or offering for sale its product in the form \n\n[305 \nU.S. 111, 115]\n\u00a0\n and shape of plaintiff's biscuit in violation of its trade-mark; and with further directions to order an accounting for damages and profits.' In its opinion the court described the trade-mark as 'consisting of a dish, containing two biscuits submerged in milk'. 3 Cir., 91 F.2d 150, 152, 155. We denied Kellogg Company's petition for a writ of certiorari, \n302 \nU.S. 733\n, 58 S.Ct. 120, and denied rehearing \n302 \nU.S. 777\n, 58 S. Ct. 139.\n On January 5, 1938, the District Court entered its mandate in the exact language of the order of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and issued a permanent injunction. Shortly thereafter National Biscuit Company petitioned the Circuit Court of Appeals to recall its mandate 'for purposes of clarification.' It alleged that Kellogg Company was insisting, contrary to the court's intention, that the effect to the mandate and writ of injunction was to forbid it from selling its product only when the trade name 'Shredded Wheat' is applied to a biscuit in the form and shape of the plaintiff's biscuit and is accompanied by a representation of a dish with biscuits in in; and that it was not enjoined from making its biscuit in the form and shape of the plaintiff's biscuit, nor from calling it 'Shredded Wheat,' unless at the same time it uses upon its cartons plaintiff's trade-mark consisting of a dish with two biscuits in it. On May 5, 1938, the Circuit Court of Appeals granted the petition for clarification and directed the District Court to enter a decree enjoining Kellogg Company (3 Cir., 96 F.2d 873):\n'(1) from the use of the name 'Shredded Wheat' as its trade name, (2) from advertising or offering for sale its product in the form and shape of plaintiff's biscuit, and (3) from doing either.'\n\n Kellogg Company then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decree as so clarified, and also sought reconsideration of our denial of its petition for certiorari to review the decree as entered in its original form. In support of these petitions it called to our attention the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 111, 116]\n\u00a0\n decision of the British Privy Council in Canadian Shredded Wheat Co., Ltd., v. Kellogg Company of Canada, Ltd., 55 R.P.C. 125, rendered after our denial of the petition for certiorari earlier in the term. We granted both petitions for certiorari. \n2\n\u00a0\n304 \nU.S. 586\n, 58 S.Ct. 1052.\n The plaintiff concedes that it does not possess the exclusive right to make shredded wheat. But it claims the exclusive right to the trade name 'Shredded Wheat' and the exclusive right to make shredded wheat biscuits pillow-shaped. It charges that the defendant, by using the name and shape, and otherwise, is passing off, or enabling others to pass off, Kellogg goods for those of the plaintiff. Kellogg Company denies that the plaintiff is entitled to the exclusive use of the name or of the pillow- shape; denies any passing off; asserts that it has used every reasonable effort to distinguish its produce from that of the plaintiff; and contends that in honestly competing for a part of the market for shredded wheat it is exercising the common right freely to manufacturer and sell an article of commerce unprotected by patent.\n First. The plaintiff has no exclusive right to the use of the term 'Shredded Wheat' as a trade name. For that is the generic term of the article, which describes it with a fair degree of accuracy; and is the term by which the biscuit in pillow-shaped form is generally known by the public. Since the term is generic, the original maker of the product acquired no exclusive right to use it. As \n\n[305 \nU.S. 111, 117]\n\u00a0\n Kellogg Company had the right to make the article, it had, also, the right to use the term by which the public knows it. Compare Saxlehner v. Wagner, \n216 \nU.S. 375\n, 30 S.Ct. 298; Holzapfel's Compositions Co. v. Rahtjen's American Composition Co., \n183 \nU.S. 1\n, 22 S.Ct. 6. Ever since 1894 the article has been known to the public as shredded wheat. For many years, there was no attempt to use the term 'Shredded Wheat' as a trade-mark. When in 1905 plaintiff's predecessor, Natural Food Company, applied for registration of the words 'Shredded Whole Wheat' as a trade- mark under the so-called 'ten year clause' of the Act of February 20, 1905, c. 592, sec. 5, 33 Stat. 725, 15 U.S.C.A.  85, William E. Williams gave notice of opposition. Upon the hearing it appeared that Williams had, as early as 1894, built a machine for making shredded wheat, and that he made and sold its product as 'Shredded Whole Wheat'. The Commissioner of Patents refused registration. The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia affirmed his decision, holding that 'these words accurately and aptly describe an article of food which ... has been produced for more than ten years ....' Natural Food Co. v. Williams, 30 App.D.C. 348.3\n Moreover, the name 'Shredded Wheat', as well as the product, the process and the machinery employed in making it, has been dedicated to the public. The basic patent for the product and for the process of making it, and many other patents for special machinery to be used in making the article, issued to Perky. In those patents the term 'shredded' is repeatedly used as descriptive of the product. The basic patent expired October 15, 1912; the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 111, 118]\n\u00a0\n others soon after. Since during the life of the patents 'Shredded Wheat' was the general designation of the patented product, there passed to the public upon the expiration of the patent, not only the right to make the article as it was made during the patent period, but also the right to apply thereto the name by which it had become known. As was said in Singer Mfg. Co. v. June Mfg. Co., \n163 \nU.S. 169, 185\n, 16 S.Ct. 1002, 1008:\n'It equally follows from the cessation of the monopoly and the falling of the patented device into the domain of things public that along with the public ownership of the device there must also necessarily pass to the public the generic designation of the thing which has arisen during the monopoly. ...\n\n'To say otherwise would be to hold that, although the public had acquired the device covered by the patent, yet the owner of the patent or the manufacturer of the patented thing had retained the designated name which was essentially necessary to vest the public with the full enjoyment of that which had become theirs by the disappearance of the monopoly.'\n\n It is contended that the plaintiff has the exclusive right to the name 'Shredded Wheat', because those words acquired the 'secondary meaning' of shredded wheat made at Niagara Falls by the plaintiff's predecessor. There is no basis here for applying the doctrine of secondary meaning. The evidence shows only that due to the long period in which the plaintiff or its predecessor was the only manufacturer of the product, many people have come to associate the product, and as a consequence the name by which the product is generally known, with the plaintiff's factory at Niagara Falls. But to establish a trade name in the term 'shredded wheat' the plaintiff must show more than a subordinate meaning which applies to it. It must show that the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer. This it has not done. The \n\n[305 \nU.S. 111, 119]\n\u00a0\n showing which it has made does not entitle it to the exclusive use of the term shredded wheat but merely entitles it to require that the defendant use reasonable care to inform the public of the source of its product.\n The plaintiff seems to contend that even if Kellogg Company acquired upon the expiration of the patents the right to use the name shredded wheat, the right was lost by delay. The argument is that kellogg Company, although the largest producer of breakfast cereals in the country, did not seriously attempt to make shredded wheat, or to challenge plaintiff's right to that name until 1927, and that meanwhile plaintiff's predecessor had expended more than $17,000,000 in making the name a household word and identifying the product with its manufacture. Those facts are without legal significance. Kellogg Company's right was not one dependent upon diligent exercise. Like every other member of the public, it was, and remained, free to make shredded wheat when it chose to do so; and to call the product by its generic name. The only obligation resting upon Kellogg Company was to identify its own product lest it be mistaken for that of the plaintiff.\n Second. The plaintiff has not the exclusive right to sell shredded wheat in the form of a pillow-shaped biscuit-the form in which the article became known to the public. That is the form in which shredded wheat was made under the basic patent. The patented machines used were designed to produce only the pillow-shaped biscuits. And a design patent was taken out to cover the pillow-shaped form. \n4\n Hence, upon expiration of the patents \n\n[305 \nU.S. 111, 120]\n\u00a0\n the form, as well as the name, was dedicated to the public. As was said in Singer Mfg. Co. v. June Mfg. Co., supra, page 185, 16 S.Ct. page 1008: 'It is self-evident that on the expiration of a patent the monopoly granted by it ceases to exist, and the right to make the thing formerly covered by the patent becomes public property. It is upon this condition that the patent is granted. It follows, as a matter of course, that on the termination of the patent there passes to the public the right to make the machine in the form in which it was constructed during the patent. We may therefore dismiss without further comment the complaint as to the form in which the defendant made his machines.'\n Where an article may be manufactured by all, a particular manufacturer can no more assert exclusive rights in a form in which the public has become accustomed to see the article and which, in the minds of the public, is primarily associated with the article rather than a particular producer, than it can in the case of a name with similar connections in the public mind. Kellogg Company was free to use the pillow- shaped form, subject only to the obligation to identify its product lest it be mistaken for that of the plaintiff.\n Third. The question remains whether Kellogg Company in exercising its right to use the name 'Shredded Wheat' and the pillow-shaped biscuit, is doing so fairly. Fairness requires that it be done in a manner which reasonably distinguishes its product from that of plaintiff.\n Each company sells its biscuits only in cartons. The standard Kellogg carton contains fifteen biscuits; the plaintiff's twelve. The Kellogg cartons are distinctive. They do not resemble those used by the plaintiff either in size, form, or color. And the difference in the labels is striking. The Kellogg cartons bear in bold script the names 'Kellogg's Whole Wheat Biscuit' or 'Kellogg's \n\n[305 \nU.S. 111, 121]\n\u00a0\n Shredded Whole Wheat Biscuit' so sized and spaced as to strike the eye as being a Kellogg product. It is true that on some of its cartons it had a picture of two shredded wheat biscuits in a bowl of milk which was quite similar to one of the plaintiff's registered trade-marks. But the name Kellogg was so prominent on all of the defendant's cartons as to minimize the possibility of confusion.\n Some hotels, restaurants, and lunchrooms serve biscuits not in cartons, and guests so served may conceivably suppose that a Kellogg biscuit served is one of the plaintiff's make. But no person familar with plaintiff's product would be misled. The Kellogg biscuit is about two- thirds the size of plaintiff's; and differs from it in appearance. Moreover, the field in which deception could be practiced is negligibly small. Only 2 1\/2 per cent of the Kellogg biscuits are sold to hotels, restaurants and lunchrooms. Of those so sold 98 per cent are sold in individual cartons containing two biscuits. These cartons are distinctive and bear prominently the Kellogg name. To put upon the individual biscuit some mark which would identify it as the Kellogg product is not commercially possible. Relatively few biscuits will be removed from the individual cartons before they reach the consumer. The obligation resting upon Kellogg Company is not to insure that every purchaser will know it to be the maker but to use every reasonable means to prevent confusion.\n It is urged that all possibility of deception or confusion would be removed if Kellogg Company should refrain from using the name 'Shredded Wheat' and adopt some form other than the pillow-shape. But the name and form are integral parts of the goodwill of the article. To share fully in the goodwill, it must use the name and the pillow-shape. And in the goodwill Kellogg Company is as free to share as the plaintiff. Compare William R. Warner & Co. v. Eli Lilly & Co., \n265 \nU.S. 526, 528\n, 530 S., 44 S. Ct. 615, 616, 617. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 111, 122]\n\u00a0\n Moreover, the pillow-shape must be used for another reason. The evidence is persuasive that this form is functional-that the cost of the biscuit would be increased and its high quality lessened if some other form were substituted for the pillow-shape.\n Kellogg Company is undoubtedly sharing in the goodwill of the article known as 'Shredded Wheat'; and thus is sharing in a market which was created by the skill and judgment of plaintiff's predecessor and has been widely extended by vast expenditures in advertising persistently made. But that is not unfair. Sharing in the goodwill of an article unprotected by patent or trade-mark is the exercise of a right possessed by all-and in the free exercise of which the consuming public is deeply interested. There is no evidence of passing off or deception on the part of the Kellogg Company;5 and it has taken every reasonable precaution to prevent confusion or the practice of deception in the sale of its product.\n Fourth. By its 'clarifying' decree, the Circuit Court of Appeals enjoined Kellogg Company from using the picture of the two shredded wheat biscuits in the bowl only in connection with an injunction against manufacturing the pillow-shaped biscuits and the use of the term shredded wheat, on the grounds of unfair competition. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 111, 123]\n\u00a0\n The use of this picture was not enjoined on the independent ground of trade-mark infringement. Since the National Biscuit Company did not petition for certiorari, the question whether use of the picture is a violation of that trade-mark although Kellogg Company is free to use the name and the pillow-shaped biscuit is not here for review.\n Decrees reversed with direction to dismiss the bill.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of opinion that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is correct and should be affirmed. To them it seems sufficiently clear that the Kellogg Company is fraudulently seeking to appropriate to itself the benefits of a goodwill built up at great cost by the respondent and its predecessors. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The federal jurisdiction rests on diversity of citizenship-National Biscuit Company being a New Jersey corporation and Kellogg Company a Delaware corporation.

Objection to their use was not charged in the bill; no such issue was raised at the trial; and the use was not enjoined. Counsel for the Company admitted in the argument before us that its use, common as applied to other Kellogg products, should not have been made on cartons of shredded wheat; and stated that the use had been discontinued long before entry of the 'clarifying' decree. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] In its opinion clarifying the mandate, the Circuit Court of Appeals, after considering the provisions concerning the name and the form of the biscuit, said (96 F.2d page 875): 'The only remaining question is whether, in view of the fact that the order of April 12, 1937, did not specifically provide for an injunction against the violation of the two-biscuit-in-a- dish trade-mark (although it was intended to do so) we have any jurisdiction to amend the mandate so as to include specifically such a provision. As there may be some doubt on this question, we will not amend the mandate so as to provide a specific injunction against the use of the two-biscuit-in-a-dish trade-mark. Its use on a carton or in advertising matter, when the defendant is not permitted to use the word 'Shredded Wheat' as a trade-name or to advertise or sell biscuits in the pillow- shaped form, would manifestly be so improper and so likely to mislead that we will assume that the appellee will not use it.' \n\n\n\n\n","82":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLACLEDE GAS LIGHT CO. v.

Waltner, of Kansas City, Mo., for appellees.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Appellee the Public Service Commission of Missouri moves to dismiss the appeal upon the ground that there is no final judgment.\n The Supreme Court of Missouri had before it an appeal from a judgment of the circuit court which had affirmed an order of the Public Service Commission fixing the value for rate making purposes of the property of the Laclede Gas Light Company and ordering a reduction in rates. The Company contended that the Com- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 398, 399]\n\u00a0\n mission's order was confiscatory, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, U.S.C.A.Const. amend. 14. The Supreme Court reviewed at length the findings of the Commission and concluded that there should be a re-examination by the Commission of certain questions of fact as to elements of value. After stating these questions, the opinion of the Supreme Court concluded as follows: 'Subject to the foregoing, the judgment is affirmed and the cause remanded, with directions to the circuit court to remand to the commission that it may rehear and determine the facts on the four points above mentioned in accordance with the views in this opinion.' State ex rel. City of St. Louis v. Public Service Commission, 110 S.W.2d 749, 780.\n The Public Service Commission, contends that under the statutes of Missouri (R.S.Mo.1929,  5234, Mo.St.Ann.  5234, p. 6661) the Supreme Court of Missouri reviews the order of the Commission judicially (Lusk v. Atkinson, 268 Mo. 109, 118, 186 S.W. 703; State ex rel. Detroit-Chicago Motor Bus Co. v. Public Service Commission, 324 Mo. 270, 275, 23 S.W.2d 115; State ex rel. City of St. Louis v.

Public Service Commission, 335 Mo. 1248, 1265, 76 S.W.2d 343); that the Commission acts legislatively (Id.); that, on the remand in this case, each of the matters mentioned by the Supreme Court will be before the Commission and that it may proceed anew in the exercise of its discretion in their determination. The Commission adds:\n'The Commission may, therefore, make a new finding of 'fair value' substantially different from the one found, as of the date of the former hearing. Moreover, such a new finding of 'fair value' together with new findings concerning the allowance for annual depreciation and amortization of cost of change-over expense would necessitate the fixing of a new rate schedule. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 398, 400]\n\u00a0\n 'From the very nature of the various items remanded for rehearing, it is conceivable that the Commission may reach conclusions which would constitute the basis of another appeal.\n\n'For the reasons stated appellee contends that there is not yet a final judgment from which an appeal can be taken.'\n\n We think that the contention of the Commission is well taken.\n Appellant urges that, under the mandate of the Supreme Court, it would be the duty of the circuit court to proceed at once to execute its judgment affirming the rate reduction order, by distributing to the customers of appellant the amounts which have been held by a designated depositary, under order of the court, pending the final determination of the validity of the rate order. No ruling of the state court for such a distribution is before us. The judgment of the Supreme Court does not direct the payment over of the amounts on deposit, and the direction of the court for remand to the Commission for further examinations of the questions stated apparently leaves in abeyance the final determination of the validity of the rate order and may result, as the Commission states, in action which may constitute the basis of another appeal. The Supreme Court expressly states that the affirmance of the judgment of the circuit court is subject to the requirement of re-examination by the Commission as directed.\n As we are unable to conclude upon the record before us that the state court has finally disposed of the controversy, the motion to dismiss the appeal must be granted.\n It is so ordered.\n Appeal dismissed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLANASA FRUIT STEAMSHIP & IMPORTING CO. v. UNIVERSAL INS. CO.(1938)\nNo. 57\nArgued: December 10, 1937Decided: January 10, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 556, 557]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George Forbes and Henry L. Wortche, both of Baltimore, Md., for petitioner.\n Messrs. D. Roger Englar, of New York City, and Frank B. Ober, of Baltimore, Md., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought upon a policy of marine insurance. Judgment for respondent was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 4 Cir., 89 F. 2d 545, and certiorari was granted. \n302 \nU.S. 664\n, 58 S.Ct. 10, 82 L.Ed. --.\n Petitioner was the owner of a cargo of bananas aboard the Norwegian steamship Smaragd. While proceeding up Chesapeake Bay to Baltimore on July 21, 1935, the vessel stranded and before she could be floated the entire cargo of bananas became overripe and rotted, causing a total loss. Petitioner held a floating policy of insurance which had been issued by respondent on June 23, 1933. The general coverage clause of the policy embraced perils of the sea. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 556, 558]\n\u00a0\n To the declaration setting forth these facts and claiming that the loss was within the coverage of the policy, respondent filed four pleas, the first two pleading the general issue and the two others being special pleas. Petitioner joined issue on the first and second pleas and demurred to the third and fourth. The District Court overruled the demurrer to the third plea and, as that decision was considered by the parties and the court to be conclusive of the issue, final judgment was entered for respondent.\n The third plea, thus sustained, set forth a rider which for an additional premium, had been added to the policy on April 4, 1934, and had been canceled on January 25, 1935, before the loss occurred. The rider amended the policy so as to provide that the coverage should be 'free of particular average unless the vessel be stranded, sunk, burned, on fire or in collision, in any, all or several of which events the insurers are liable for such loss by decay, injury or damage to the fruit as is occasioned thereby or occurs during or in consequence of delay resulting therefrom.' The insurers also assumed liability for such loss in consequence of delay resulting from breakage of shaft, loss of blades from propeller, and derangement or breakage of machinery or rudder and\/or stern post, 'whether or not the vessel be stranded, sunk, burned or in collision,' provided that the loss amounted to 10 per cent. after deducting 5 per cent. for ordinary loss.\n On the cancellation of the rider it was agreed that the policy should have the same coverage as prior thereto, and the premium rate was reduced from 60 cents to the original rate of 25 cents on the $100 of risk. 89 F. 2d 545, at page 546.\n In affirming the judgment, the Circuit Court of Appeals observed that the judgment had been entered upon the pleadings and that petitioner had conceded that its right to recover depended upon the construction of the policy. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 556, 559]\n\u00a0\n 89 F.2d at pages 545, 546. The appellate court then examined the policy and after a review of authorities in this country and in England held that the loss was not within the general coverage clause relating to perils of the sea. The court in concluding its opinion referred to the rider as showing that the parties had interpreted that clause in the same way. Id., page 549. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the principal question thus determined by the Court of Appeals, a question which had not been decided by this Court and as to which the decisions of other courts were said to be in conflict.\n We are met by two preliminary questions. The first of these is with respect to the sufficiency of the declaration. It is suggested that the declaration does not allege that the bananas were shipped in sound condition and that they would have been merchantable at the end of a normal voyage, and that there is no allegation as to the duration of the delay. It does not appear that these questions were raised in the District Court and they were not dealt with by the Court of Appeals, which evidently assumed the sufficiency of the declaration to present the main question as to the interpretation of the general coverage clause. Both courts below have decided the case upon the assumption that the fruit was in sound condition when shipped and would have been merchantable at the end of the voyage had it not been for the stranding and the consequent delay. In view of this course of proceedings we make the same assumption. If any question as to the condition of the cargo or length of the delay and its effect had been presented in the trial court, it might have been met by amendment of the declaration and the issue could have been tried; and if the main question, upon the assumption stated, has been wrongly decided and the case is remanded to the District Court, there will still be opportunity to try any other issues of fact or law which may properly be presented. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 556, 560]\n\u00a0\n The other preliminary question is with respect to the effect of the rider above mentioned. We do not regard that indorsement as either controlling or persuasive. Manifestly it did not affect the application of the general coverage clause. That clause had been in effect for a long period before the rider and by express agreement that clause remained in effect after the rider was canceled. The rider covered losses not embraced in the marine perils against which the policy insured and it also covered losses which were already covered by the policy, and there was room for difference of opinion as to exactly how far the rider overlapped. The actual views of the parties when the rider was obtained and the reasons for its cancellation are not shown with any definiteness. For all that appears the insured may have been advised and may have assumed that the coverage clause of the policy gave protection in such a case as is here involved and may not have desired to continue to pay the additional premium for the other losses described. We are not called upon to speculate as to the state of mind of the insured's officers and one asserted ambiguity is not to be cured by another. If the general coverage clause permits recovery, we see nothing to defeat it in what was done in connection with the rider.\n Petitioner thus states the main question broadly: Does the general clause of the marine cargo insurance policy, insuring for loss caused by perils of the sea, cover a loss where a marine peril, viz., stranding, has so delayed the voyage that the cargo has become a total loss?\n Respondent contends (1) that deterioration of perishable cargo caused through inherent vice while the vessel is delayed by a sea peril, is not, without more, covered under a marine policy which does not expressly insure against such deterioration; and (2) that in order to recover for such deterioration it must be shown that the adventure was not merely delayed but frustrated by rea- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 556, 561]\n\u00a0\n son of the vessel's forced departure from the course of her voyage, as, for example, where the vessel has put into a port of distress and remained there for a period which constituted a virtual abandonment or frustration of the voyage.\n In considering these contentions, we start with the fact that the vessel, while proceeding up Chesapeake Bay, stranded. That is alleged and conceded. Stranding is a peril of the sea. Liverpool & Great Western Steam Co. v. Phenix Insurance Co., \n129 \nU.S. 397, 438\n, 9 S.Ct. 469; Richelieu & Ontario Navigation Company v. Boston Marine Insurance Co., \n136 \nU.S. 408, 421\n, 10 S.Ct. 934; Arnould on Marine Insurance, 11th ed.,  816; Winter on Marine Insurance, 2d Ed., p. 156. Loss through stranding was within the coverage of the policy. This, as the court below observed, was expressly recognized in the warranties against particular average in which loss by stranding was excepted. 89 F.2d 545, at pages 546, 547. And it was the stranding which caused the delay. The case is not one of the mere lengthening of a voyage due to the ordinary vicissitudes of wind and wave against which the underwriter does not insure, Jordan v. Warren Insurance Co., Fed.Cas.No.7,524, 1 Story 342, 352, and we are not called upon to determine in what circumstances other than those now presented delay may be considered to be due to a peril of the sea within the meaning of the policy.\n The cargo was perishable fruit. Respondent insists that its decay was caused by inherent vice which began to operate as soon as the fruit was picked. But, although perishable, the cargo was insured for the voyage against sea perils and the sole question is whether a sea peril caused the loss. As we have said, we must assume for the present purpose, in view of the way in which the case was presented and determined below, that the fruit was sound when shipped and would have been merchantable on arrival after a normal voyage, and that had it not been \n\n[302 \nU.S. 556, 562]\n\u00a0\n for the delay due to the stranding of the vessel, the loss would not have occurred despite the perishable nature of the cargo.\n We are not impressed by the argument that to permit recovery it must appear that the adventure was not merely delayed but that it was frustrated through a forced departure of the vessel from the course of her voyage and the putting into a port of distress. So far as the cargo in question was concerned, the adventure was frustrated by the stranding, and the cargo became a total loss before the vessel could be floated. That loss was just as complete as if the vessel had been compelled to put into a port and the voyage had then been abandoned.\n The sole question is whether in these circumstances the stranding should be regarded as the proximate cause of the loss. Respondent contends that decay or inherent vice was the proximate cause. It is true that the doctrine of proximate cause is applied strictly in cases of marine insurance. But in that class of cases, as well as in others, the proximate cause is the efficient cause and not a merely incidental cause which may be nearer in time to the result. AEtna Insurance Company v. Boon, \n95 \nU.S. 117\n, 130; Arnould on Insurance, 11th ed.,  783.\n The subject was discussed in an illuminating way by Lord Shaw in his judgment in Leyland Shipping Company v. Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society, (1918) A.C. 350, 368-371. He said:\n'To treat proxima causa as the cause which is nearest in time is out of the question. Causes are spoken of as if they were as distinct from one another as beads in a row or links in a chain, but-if this metaphysical topic has to be referred to-it is not wholly so. The chain of causation is a handy expression, but the figure is inadequate. Causation is not a chain, but a net. At each point influences, forces, events, precedent and simultaneous, meet; and the radiation from each point extends \n\n[302 \nU.S. 556, 563]\n\u00a0\n infinitely. At the point where these various influences meet it is for the judgment as upon a matter of fact to declare which of the causes thus joined at the point of effect was the proximate and which was the remote cause.\n\n'What does 'proximate' here mean? To treat proximate cause as if it was the cause which is proximate in time is, as I have said, out of the question. The cause which is truly proximate is that which is proximate in efficiency. That efficiency may have been preserved although other causes may meantime have sprung up which have yet not destroyed it, or truly impaired it, and it may culminate in a result of which it still remains the real efficient cause to which the event can be ascribed.'\n\n There, in a policy insuring a ship, there was a warranty of exception in case of hostilities or warlike operations, and the question was whether the loss of the vessel fell within the exception. The vessel was torpedoed and sustained severe injuries, but succeeded in making the outer harbor of the port of Havre. Notwithstanding all efforts by pumping and otherwise, she bumped, broke her back, and sank. It was contended that she perished by a peril of the sea because sea water entered the gash in her side which the torpedo made. The entry of the sea water was indeed a peril of the sea and was proximate in time to the sinking. But as 'proximate cause is an expression referring to the efficiency as an operating factor upon the result' it was held that 'the real efficient cause' of the sinking of the vessel was that she was torpedoed and hence that the loss was within the exception.\n In the Leyland Case the House of Lords approved the decision of the Court of Appeal in Reischer v. Borwick, (1894) 2 Q.B. 548, where the policy covered collision with any object but excluded perils of the sea. The ship struck a snag which made a hole in her. She was anchored and the leak was temporarily plugged. Then, while she was being towed towards the nearest dock for \n\n[302 \nU.S. 556, 564]\n\u00a0\n repair, the water burst through the hole and she had to be run aground and abandoned. The contention was that the proximate cause of the damage was the excepted marine peril of the inrush of the sea water. But the Court of Appeal held that the proximate cause was the collision with the snag.\n The same principle applies although within the network of causation there may be found the operation of natural forces to which a disaster, within the coverage of the policy, has given play. The decision of Justice Story in Magoun v. New England Marine Insurance Company, Fed.Cas.No.8,961, 1 Story 157, is an illustration. In that case the question was whether the loss was due to a restraint and detainment of government within the words of a policy insuring the vessel and freight. It appeared that there had been an arrest and detainment by the authorities of New Granada; that the vessel had been restored, but that, when restored, it was found, from her long exposure to the weather in a hot climate, in an open roadstead, that she had been so damaged that she could not perform the voyage without great repairs which would cost more than the vessel was worth; that hides belonging to the cargo had become rotten and were thrown overboard; and that no other vessel could be found to carry the residue of the cargo to destination. The vessel was accordingly abandoned to the underwriters, and Justice Story held that the abandonment was good and the underwriters were liable for a total loss. He said: 'The argument is, that the injury to the vessel, by the long delay and exposure to the climate, was the immediate cause of the loss, and the seizure and detainment the remote cause only; and that, therefore, the rule applies, 'Causa proxima, non remota, spectatur,' and the underwriters are not liable for injury by mere wear and tear, or by delays in the voyage, or by worms, or by exposure to the climate. But it appears to me, that this is not a \n\n[302 \nU.S. 556, 565]\n\u00a0\n correct exposition of the rule. All the consequences naturally flowing from the peril insured against, or incident thereto, are properly attributable to the peril itself.'\n In support, Justice Story referred to the decision of the Court in Peters v. Warren Insurance Co., 14 Pet. 99, in which he delivered the opinion. In that case he put the following illustration, 14 Pet. 99, at page 110: 'Suppose a perishable cargo is greatly damaged by the perils of the sea, and it should, in consequence thereof, long afterwards, and before arrival at the port of destination, become gradually so putrescent as to be required to be thrown overboard for the safety of the crew: the immediate cause of the loss would be the act of the master and crew; but there is no doubt, that the underwriters would be liable for a total loss, upon the ground that the operative cause was the perils of the sea.'\n And in the same case, Justice Story took occasion to observe that if there be any commercial contract, which, more than any other, 'requires the application of sound common sense and practical reasoning in the exposition of it,' it is 'certainly a policy of insurance.' Id., 14 Pet. 99, at page 109.\n If we apply this principle of the 'real efficient cause' to the instant case, it can hardly be doubted that upon the facts assumed the loss would be within the coverage of the policy. Indeed this is not strongly contested, but it is insisted that the case is controlled by certain precedents to which we should give heed in dealing with an ancient form of words. These precedents are found in certain English cases to which the Circuit Court of Appeals referred. The court recognized that a number of American cases had taken a different view, but thought that, in the absence of a contrary decision by this Court or any federal court, the cited English cases should be followed in the view that in the field of marine insurance 'it is highly desirable that our decisions be kept in harmony with those of England.' 89 F.2d 545, at page 549. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 556, 566]\n\u00a0\n Reference is made to the case of Taylor v. Dunbar, L.R. 4 C.P. 206. There meat shipped at Hamburgh for London was delayed on the voyage by tempestuous weather and solely by reason of such delay became putrid and was necessarily thrown overboard. The court held that it was not a loss by perils of the sea. Judge Keating said that the facts showed 'beyond a doubt that the proximate cause of the loss of the meat was the delay in the prosecution of the voyage,' and 'that delay was occasioned by tempestuous weather.' But he held 'that a loss by the unexpected duration of the voyage, though that be caused by perils of the sea,' did not entitle the assured to recover. Judge Montague Smith, concurring, said that if it were held 'that a loss by delay, caused by bad weather or the prudence of the captain in anchoring to avoid it, was a loss by perils of the sea,' the court would 'be opening a door to claims for losses which never were intended to be covered by insurance, not only in the case of perishable goods but in the case of goods of all other descriptions.'\n The case of Pink v. Fleming, L.R. 25 Q.B.D. 396, upon which chief reliance is placed, was a case of collision. It was necessary for the damaged ship to put into a port for repairs and for that purpose to discharge a portion of the goods insured, consisting of fruit. The goods were reshipped but on arrival it was found that being of a perishable nature they had been damaged by the handling necessary for their discharge and reshipment and by the delay. The Court of Appeal held that the collision was not the proximate cause of the loss and that there could be no recovery on the policy. Lord Esher said: 'The collision may be said to have been a cause, and an effective cause, of the ship's putting into a port and of repairs being necessary. For the purpose of such repairs it was necessary to remove the fruit, and such removal necessarily caused damage to it. The agent, however, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 556, 567]\n\u00a0\n which proximately caused the damage to the fruit was the handling, though no doubt the cause of the handling was the repairs, and the cause of the repairs was the collision. According to the English law of marine insurance only the last cause can be regarded. There is nothing in the policy to say that the underwriters will be liable for loss occasioned by that. To connect the loss with any peril mentioned in the policy the plaintiffs must go back two steps, and that, according to English law, they are not entitled to do.'\n The court thought that the case was governed by Taylor v. Dunbar, supra. Lord Esher added: 'With regard to the American authorities, the American law on the subject seems to differ materially from our law, and therefore it is not necessary to consider them.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n It seems that neither of these cases went to the House of Lords, and we find it impossible to reconcile Lord Esher's ruling, 'that according to the English law of marine insurance only the last cause can be regarded,' with the elaborate exposition of the doctrine of proximate cause which has been given by the House of Lords in Leyland Shipping Company v. Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society, supra, from which we have quoted. And it is recognized in England that 'Passages in Lord Esher's Judgment in Pink v. Fleming ... to the effect that only the cause last in time can be looked to, cannot now be supported.' Arnould on Marine Insurance, 11th ed.,  783, note (r). So far as the English rule, however, relates to losses, on ship or goods, 'proximately caused by delay,' 'although the delay be caused by a peril insured against,' it has been embodied in statute which apparently applies to all goods, perishable or otherwise, unless the policy otherwise provides. That statute of course is controlling in relation to \n\n[302 \nU.S. 556, 568]\n\u00a0\n English practice in that class of cases. Marine Insurance Act, 1906, sec. 55(2)(b). L.R. Statutes, 6 Edward VII, p. 227. There is no statute applicable here which so restricts the doctrine of proximate cause, as we understand it and as it is set forth in the Leyland Case, and the weight of American authority is contrary to the doctrine of Pink v. Fleming.\n In williams v. Smith, 1804, 2 Caines, N.Y., 1, 2 Am.Dec. 209, the action was on a policy of insurance covering a cargo consisting chiefly of naval stores, including tar in barrels, on a voyage from New York to Algiers. The vessel experienced severe weather which resulted in such serious damage that it was compelled to put into Cadiz as a port of distress. There more than half of her landing was taken out and the vessel moved to the usual place for repairing. While there an epidemic fever broke out which prevented all business and made it impossible to obtain permits for taking the cargo from the place where it had been landed. Meanwhile the vessel was driven to sea by a storm and sustained further injuries and on returning to Cadiz it was found that the cargo, both on shore and on board, from the heat of the climate and violence of the gale, was deteriorated more than one half of its original value. As the whole would not have produced enough to fit the ship for the completion of her voyage, the vessel and the cargo were abandoned to the underwriters. The court charged the jury, among other things, that 'any damages which arose in consequence of the fever at Cadiz, were within the perils of the policy.' The jury brought in a verdict for a total loss. The court denied a new trial, Judge Kent stating in his opinion 'that the damage resulting from the pestilence at Cadiz' was covered by the policy. The court found it unnecessary to decide 'whether a pestilence is a peril direct within the policy,' but held that it formed 'a sound excuse for delay at Cadiz' and 'if the consequence of that delay was a deterioration of the subject insured, the insurer must be answerable for the loss.' \n\n[302 \nU.S. 556, 569]\n\u00a0\n In Tudor v. New England Marine Insurance Company, 12 Cush., Mass., 554, the suit was upon a policy of insurance on a cargo of ice shipped from Boston to Calcutta. It was agreed that the ice was properly packed and surrounded with nonconductors of heat. Under the stipulations of the policy, the insurer could be liable, if at all, only for a total loss. There was also a clause that there should be no liability 'for ice melting in consequence of putting into port.' By perils of the sea, the vessel sprung a leak which increased and it became necessary to put away for a port. On taking out her cargo, in order to ascertain her condition and the practicability of repairs, it was found that the ice had settled; a portion of it having been melted by the sea water which had come in contact with it by reason of the leak. The ice was taken out and sold for a very small sum in comparison with its estimated value at the port of delivery. The voyage was abandoned. It was denied that the loss was occasioned by a peril of the sea. The insured had judgment for a total loss. The court considered it to be well settled that if an article insured as free from average be 'placed in such a condition, that in consequence of inevitable deterioration or decay, it cannot be carried to the port of destination, but will necessarily, before the completion of the voyage, be wholly destroyed, and it is accordingly sold, at an intermediate port,' this would constitute a total loss within the meaning of the policy. The court also held that the exception of the risk of ice 'melting in consequence of putting into port' did not include 'a loss occasioned by the melting of the ice from other causes, or a combination of other causes.' The real cause was the injury to the vessel which made it necessary to take out the ice in a port in the tropics. See, also, Musgrave v. Mannheim Insurance Co., 32 Nova Scotia Rep. 405.\n Cory v. Boylston Insurance Company, 107 Mass. 140, 9 Am.Rep. 14, is cited by respondent as an answer to the Tudor Case, but the latter was not overruled or even mentioned. In the Cory \n\n[302 \nU.S. 556, 570]\n\u00a0\n Case a vessel with wine on board met with severe gales which prolonged her voyage and caused her to ship much sea water, and upon her arrival at the port of destination the cases of wine were found to be more or less wet either by the sea water or by the steam and dampness generated in the hold by the presence of the sea water and the changes of climate through which the vessel had passed. The case was controlled by special provisions of the policy. The policy provided that the insurers should not be liable for loss by leakage unless occasioned by stranding or collision, or 'for damage or injury to goods by dampness, rust, change of flavor, or by being spotted, discolored, musty or mouldy, unless the same be caused by actual contact of sea water with the articles damaged, occasioned by sea perils.' The court thought that the latter clause was inserted with a knowledge of the decisions in Baker v. Manufacturers' Insurance Co., 12 Gray 603, and Montoya v. London Assurance Co., 6 Exch. 451. To bring a case within that clause the court held that it was not enough 'that perils of the sea should be the efficient, and within the rule laid down in the previous decisions, the proximate cause, by which the sea water was shipped,' but that the sea water 'must come into actual contact with the articles, for the damage to which the underwriters are sought to be charged.'\n Respondent also cites Perry v. Cobb, 88 Me. 435, 34 A. 278, 280, 49 L. R.A. 389, where the insurance was on a cargo of lime shipped by a brig from Rockland to New York. The voyage was prolonged on account of rough weather but the vessel arrived tight and only slightly damaged. No sea water had reached the cargo unless in a few instances where a hatch had been taken off or once when the cabin was flooded. That damage was far below the partial loss which had been excepted from the coverage. The remaining damage was 'from the shrinking of the staves of the barrels, and slacking up of the cooperage,' causing a loss of contents and \n\n[302 \nU.S. 556, 571]\n\u00a0\n making the barrels insecure for hoisting; a condition which was claimed to have resulted from the rolling and pitching of the vessel caused by the storms of an unusually protracted voyage. The court said that 'All authorities agree that a protracted voyage is not a sea peril, within a marine policy, because it is not an unusual event, but one of the natural incidents to sea transit'; that the evidence was conflicting 'as to the proximate cause for the condition of the cargo upon its arrival'; that the associates, who in this case had insured each other and to whom it was agreed that the question of liability should be submitted, were men of large experience in burning and shipping lime; and that their decision against the plaintiff 'must have great weight upon the fact as to whether the condition of the cargo, upon its arrival in New York, was other than what might have been expected from ordinary sea weather at that time of year,' without any 'unusual sea peril.' The conclusion was that the principal damage to the cargo came 'from its own inherent qualities, excited by the longcontinued transit.' Id., 88 Me. 435, at pages 449, 450, 34 A. 278, 282, 49 L.R.A. 389.\n In the case of Bond v. The Superb, 3 Fed.Cas. p. 845, No. 1,624, 1 Wall.Jr. 355, also cited by respondent and the court below, the decision of Mr. Justice Grier at circuit turned upon the question of liability for general average and in this view had distinguishing features.\n Fourteen years ago a case closely resembling the one at bar came before the New York courts. Brandyce v. United States Lloyds, The Corsicana, 207 App.Div. 665, 203 N.Y.S. 10, 11; Id., 239 N.Y. 573, 147 N.E. 201. The action was upon policies covering a cargo of potatoes insured against perils of the sea. The vessel, in consequence of a collision at sea with some unknown object, was compelled to put into Charleston for repairs where it was found necessary to discharge the cargo. After repairs the vessel resumed her voyage but, on account of the delay, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 556, 572]\n\u00a0\n the potatoes because of sprouting and rot had to be sold. They were not injured directly in the collision or touched by sea water. The precise question presented was 'whether loss by natural deterioration, during a delay in the voyage caused by a sea peril, is a loss by sea perils, within the meaning and intent of the policy of insurance.' The Appellate Division reviewed the authorities in England and in this country. The court held that mere delay on the voyage, as a result of which cargo is spoiled or damaged, was not a ground for recovery. But the court found that the collision, the sea peril insured against, was the real cause of the loss. The court said: 'The evidence indicates that, if the Corsicana had not been damaged by reason of sea perils, the potatoes would have arrived sound. The proximate cause of the loss, therefore, was the sea peril, because it was the efficient dominant cause, which, although incidentally involving delay, placed the cargo in such a condition that, because of inevitable deterioration or decay, it could not be reshipped and carried to its destination.' The Court of Appeals of New York stated the question in the same way and affirmed the judgment.\n We lay on one side cases of protracted voyages caused by storms and the special questions to which their varied circumstances give rise. Such a case is not before us. The instant case is one of stranding, a sea peril insured against, and we think that the well-settled doctrine of proximate cause meaning the real efficient cause of the loss, requires the conclusion that, upon the assumptions of fact we stated at the outset, the loss of the cargo was within the general coverage clause of the policy.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND are of opinion that the case was correctly decided by the court below on grounds adequately stated. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As to other English decisions cited below, Tatham v.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1938)\nNo. 919\nArgued: April 28, 1938Decided: May 16, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[304 \nU.S. 264, 265]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. B. Jones and Robert E. Bronson, both of Seattle, Wash., for Lang et al.\n Miss Helen R. Carloss, of Washington, D.C., for Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n\n\n\n[304 \nU.S. 264, 266]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals has certified propositions of law concerning which instructions are desired for decision of a pending cause. 28 U.S.C.A.  346.\n In 1905 Julius C. Lang married in the State of Washington, where community property laws have long obtained, and both parties continued to be domiciled there until he died in 1929. At his death seventeen policies of insurance upon his life-totaling above $200,000-were in force. Each policy required advanced payment of one premium. Fourteen specified the wife as sole beneficiary; children were the beneficiaries in three. Three o t hose payable to the wife were obtained by the assured prior to marriage and early premium payments upon them came from his separate property; later ones from community funds. Application for fourteen policies followed the marriage and all premiums thereon were paid from community funds.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled that under section 302(g), Revenue Act 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 70, 26 U.S.C.A.  411(g), the entire proceeds from all policies should be reckoned as part of the assured's gross estate subject to the permitted exemption of $40,000 and made an assessment accordingly. The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed.\n The exemption is not controverted and by admission each policy permitted the assured to change the beneficiary. The point for consideration is whether all or any portion of the proceeds of a policy, premiums on which were paid out of community funds, must be treated as part of the decedent's gross estate.\n The court below concluded that the laws of Washington establish a community between spouses which is a separate entity, 'just as a corporation or an association,' and that life insurance purchased with its funds is community \n\n[304 \nU.S. 264, 267]\n\u00a0\n property whose character the husband cannot defeat through change of beneficiary.\n Accepting as correct, for present purposes this construction of the local law, also treating the facts disclosed by the certificate as the essential ones, we come to consider the questions submitted for instructions which are restated in order more definitely to indicate our understanding of their significance.\n The construction of the local law approved below is certainly a tenable one and finds support in Graham v. Commissioner, 95 F.2d 174, Ninth Circuit, March 4, 1938; Occidental Life Ins. Co. v. Powers, 74 P.2d 27, 114 A.L.R. 531, Supreme Court of Washington, December 6, 1937; Poe v. Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101, 113\n, 51 S.Ct. 58, 60.\n Occasion for the certificate did not arise from doubts relating to the meaning of the community property laws of Washington, but from uncertainty concerning the application of the 1926 Revenue Act to an estate under administration in that State. The court was perplexed by Bank of America Nat. Trust & Sav. Ass'n v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 9 Cir., 90 F.2d 981, 983, which affirmed that the operation of that Act is not dependent upon local law and 'therefore, whatever the local law may be, we believe it to be immaterial.' This statement is not accurate and conflicts with what we have said. Poe v. Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101, 111\n, 112 S., 51 S.Ct. 58, 59; Blair v. Com'r, \n300 \nU.S. 5, 9\n, 10 S., 57 S.Ct. 330, 331, 332.\n\n 1. \nMust the total or only one-half of the proceeds collected under the insurance policies issued after marriage on the deceased husband's life be reckoned as part of his gross estate, the wife being sole beneficiary and all premiums having been paid from community funds? To this we answer, only one-half.\n\n 2. \nMust the total proceeds of the policy upon a decedent's life, taken out after marriage, children being the sole beneficiaries, and all premiums having been paid from community funds, be reckoned as part of his gross estate; or, in the circumstances, is only one-half to be included? To this we reply, only one-half should be included. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 264, 268]\n\u00a0\n 3. Must all proceeds of the policies issued before marriage upon the deceased husband's life be reckoned as part of his gross estate, the wife being sole beneficiary, the first premium having been paid from his separate funds, and all subsequent ones from community funds; or, in the circumstances, is the total received under the policy reduced by one-half of that proportion of such total which premiums satisfied with community funds bear to all premiums paid, the amount to be regarded as belonging to the gross estate? To this we reply, only the total proceeds less one-half of the indicated proportion becomes part of the gross estate.\n Section 301(a), Revenue Act 1926, supra, 44 Stat. 69, 26 U..C .A.  410, imposes a tax upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent, etc. And section 302, 44 Stat. 70, 26 U.S.C.A.  411(g) provides:\n'The value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated ... ((a), (b), (c), ( d), (e), (f).)\n\n'(g) To the extent of the amount receivable by the executor as insurance under policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life; and to the extent of the excess over $40,000 of the amount receivable by all other beneficiaries as insurance under policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life.'\n\n The Revenue Acts of 1918, 1921 and 1924, 40 Stat. 1097,  402; 42 Stat. 278,  402; 43 Stat. 304,  302, contain similar provisions relative to 'policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life.'\n Treasury Regulations 37 promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1918 provide:\n'Art. 32. ... The term 'insurance' refers to life insurance of every description ... Insurance is deemed to be taken out by the decedent in all cases where he pays the premiums, either directly or indirectly, whether or not he makes the application. On the other hand, the insur- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 264, 269]\n\u00a0\n ance should not be included in the gross estate, even though the application is made by the decedent, where the premiums are actually paid by some other person or corporation, and not out of funds belonging to, or advanced by, the decedent. ...'\n\n And there are similar provisions in Treasury Regulations 63, art. 27, promulgated under 1921 Revenue Act.\n Treasury Regulations 68 promulgated under the Revenue Act 1924:\n'Art. 25. ...\n\n'The term 'insurance' refers to life insurance of every description ... Insurance is deemed to be taken out by the decedent in all cases where he pays all the premiums, either directly or indirectly, whether or not he makes the application. On the other hand, the insurance is not deemed to be taken out by the decedent, even though the application is made by him, where all the premiums are actually paid by the beneficiary. Where a portion of the premiums were paid by the beneficiary and the remaining portion by the decedent the insurance will be deemed to have been taken out by the latter in the proportion that the premiums paid by him bear to the total of premiums paid.'\n\n'Art. 28. The amount to be returned where the policy is payable to or for the benefit of the estate is the amount receivable. Where the proceeds of a policy are payable to a beneficiary other than to or for the benefit of the estate, and all the premiums were paid by the decedent, the amount to be listed on Schedule C of the return is the full amount receivable, but where the proceeds are so payable and only a portion of the premiums were paid by the decedent, the amount to be listed on such schedule is that proportion of the insurance receivable which the premiums paid by the decedent bears to the total premiums paid. ...' \n\n[304 \nU.S. 264, 270]\n\u00a0\n Articles 25 and 28, Treasury Regulations 70 promulgated under Revenue Act 1926, contain provisions identical with those just quoted.\n\n Treasury Regulations 70 were in force when Lang died and are applicable to his estate. It is unnecessary for us to consider the meaning, validity or effect of the changes introduced by Regulations 80.\n Articles 25 and 28 of Regulations 70 defines the words 'policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life.' Earlier regulations gave the same definition. Nothing else appearing, it must be treated as approved by Congress. Helvering v. Bliss, \n293 \nU.S. 144, 151\n, 55 S.Ct. 17, 20, 97 A.L.R. 207. Counsel for the Commissioner suggest that it is at variance with the statute, unreasonable and without effect; but we think this objection is clearly untenable.\n Under the community property statutes of Washington, Rem.Rev.Stat. Wash.  6892 et seq., as interpreted below, one-half of the amounts of community funds applied to payment of premiums ws property of the wife. To that extent she paid these premiums. Where she is the beneficiary, under the words of the Regulations she became entitled to the proceeds of the policy in proportion to the amount so paid.\n Where children were named beneficiaries and premiums were paid from community funds the situation is not within the precise words of the Regulations; but the rather obvious reason underlying the definition of what constitutes a policy 'taken out by the assured' should be respected. In the absence of a clear declaration it cannot be assumed that Congress intended insurance bought and paid for with the funds of another than the insured and not payable to the latter's estate, should be reckoned as part of such estate for purposes of taxation. See Igleheart v. Com'r, 5 Cir., 77 F.2d 704, 711.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLAUF v. E.G. SHINNER & CO.(1938)\nNo. 293\nArgued: January 12, 1938Decided: February 28, 1938\n\n\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 325]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. W. Richter and Morris Fromkin, both of Milwaukee, Wis., for petitioners.\n Mr. Walter L. Gold, of Milwaukee, Wis., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to restrain the petitioners from picketing the respondent's place of business; from coercing the respondent to discharge any of its employees who do not belong to the petitioning union, or to compel them to become members of the union and to accept it as their bargaining agent and representative; and from advertising that the respondent is unfair to organized labor or molesting customers or prospective customers or persuading them to cease patronizing it. After a hearing, and upon findings of fact and conclusions of law, the District Court granted a preliminary injunction. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n1\n Upon final hearing the parties relied upon the record as made in the preliminary hearing and some additional testimony.\n The District Court found the following facts: The respondent is a Delaware corporation maintaining five meat markets in Milwaukee, Wis. The petitioners are, respectively, an unincorporated labor union and its business manager, citizens and residents of Wisconsin. The respondent's employees number about thirty-five; none of them are members of the petitioning union. The petitioners made demand upon the respondent to require its employees, as a condition of their continued employment, to become members of the union. The respondent notified the employees that they were free to do this and that it was willing to permit them to join, but they declined \n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 326]\n\u00a0\n and refused to join. The union had not been chosen by the employees to represent them in any matter connected with the respondent. For the purpose of coercing the respondent to require its employees to join the union and to accept it as their bargaining agent and representative, as a condition of continued employment, and for the purpose of injuring and destroying the business if the respondent refused to yield to such coercion, the petitioners conspired to do the following things, and did them: They caused false and misleading signs to be placed before the respondent's markets; caused persons who were not respondent's employees to parade and picket before the markets; falsely accused respondent of being unfair to organized labor in its dealings with employees, and, by molestation, annoyance, threats, and intimidation, prevented patrons and prospective patrons of respondent from patronizing its markets; respondent suffered and will suffer irreparable injury from the continuance of the practice, and customers will be intimidated and restrained from patronizing the stores as a consequence of petitioners' acts. There is more than $3,000 involved in the controversy.\n The District Court held that no labor dispute, as defined by federal or state law, exists between the respondent and the petitioners or either of them; that the respondent is bound to permit its employees free agency in the matter of choice of union organization or representation; and that the respondent had no adequate remedy at law. It entered a final decree enjoining the petitioners from seeking to coerce the respondent to discharge any of its employees for refusal to join the union or to coerce the respondent to compel employees to become members of the organization, from advertising that the respondent is unfair to organized labor, and from annoying or molesting patrons or persuading or soliciting customers, present or prospective, not to patronize the respondent's markets. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 327]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. \n2\n By reason of alleged conflict with a decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, Senn v. Tile Layers Protective Union, 222 Wis. 383, 268 N.W. 270, 872, and with our decision in Senn v. Tile Layers Protective Union, \n301 \nU.S. 468\n, 57 S. Ct. 857, we granted the writ of certiorari. \n302 \nU.S. 669\n, 58 S.Ct. 41, 82 L.Ed. --.\n In the Court of Appeals the petitioners assigned error to certain of the District Court's findings of fact as well as to its conclusions of law. In this court the only errors assigned are to the holdings that, on the facts found, there was no labor dispute and that the Norris-La Guardia Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  101 et seq., and the Wisconsin Labor Code had no bearing on the case as made. In these circumstances we accept the findings of fact and confine our inquiry to the correctness of the District Court's conclusions based upon them.\n The institution of the suit in the federal court is justified by the findings as to diversity of citizenship and the amount in controversy. As the acts complained of occurred in Wisconsin, the law of that state governs the substantive rights of the parties. But the power of the court to grant the relief prayed depends upon the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the statutes of the United States.\n First. The District Court erred in holding that no labor dispute, as defined by the law of Wisconsin, existed between the parties. Section 103. 62, paragraph (3) of the Wisconsin Labor Code,3 is: 'The term 'labor dispute' includes any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment, or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment, or concerning employment relations, or any other controversy arising out of the respective interests of employer and employe, regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employe.' \n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 328]\n\u00a0\n The District Court was bound by the construction of the section by the Supreme Court of the state,4 which has held a controversy indistinguishable from that here disclosed to be a labor dispute within the meaning of the statute. \n 5\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The District Court erred in not applying the provisions of section 103.536 of the Wisconsin Labor Code, which declares certain conduct lawful in labor disputes; inter alia 'giving publicity to ... the existence of, or the facts involved in, any dispute ... by ... patrolling any public street ... without intimidation or coercion, or by any other method not involving fraud, violence, breach of the peace, or threat thereof'; advising, urging, or inducing, without fraud, violence, or threat thereof, others to cease to patronize any person; peaceful picketing or patrolling, whether singly or in numbers. A Wisconsin court could not enjoin acts declared by the statute to be lawful;7 and the District Court has no greater power to do so. The error into which the court fell as to the existence of a labor dispute led it into the further error of issuing an order so sweeping as to enjoin acts made lawful by the state statute. The decree forbade all picketing, all advertising that the respondent was unfair to organized labor, and all persuasion and solicitation of customers or prospective customers not to trade with respondent. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 329]\n\u00a0\n Third. The District Court erred in granting an injunction in the absence of findings which the Norris-La Guardia Act8 makes prerequisites to the exercise of jurisdiction.\n Section 13(c) of the act9 is: 'The term 'labor dispute' includes any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment, or concerning the association or representation of the persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment, regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employe.'\n This definition does not differ materially from that above quoted from the Wisconsin Labor Code, and the facts of the instant case bring it within both.\n Section 710 declares that 'no court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to issue a temporary or permanent injunction in any case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, as herein defined,' except after a hearing of a described character, 'and except after findings of fact by the court, to the effect (a) that unlawful acts have been threatened and will be committed unless restrained or have been committed and will be continued unless restrained,' and that no injunction 'shall be issued on account of any threat or unlawful act excepting against the person or persons, association, or organization making the threat or committing the unlawful act or actually authorizing or ratifying the same.' By subsections (b) to (e) it is provided that relief shall not be granted unless the court finds that substantial and irreparable injury to complainants' property will follow; that as to \n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 330]\n\u00a0\n each item of relief granted greater injury will be inflicted upon the complainant by denying the relief than will be inflicted upon defendants by granting it; that complainant has no adequate remedy at law; and that the public officers charged with the duty to protect complainants' property are unable or unwilling to provide adequate protection.\n There can be no question of the power of Congress thus to define and limit the jurisdiction of the inferior courts of the United States. \n11\n The District Court made none of the required findings save as to irreparable injury and lack of remedy at law. It follows that in issuing the injunction it exceeded its jurisdiction.\n Fourth. The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the declarations of policy in the Norris-La Guardia Act and the Wisconsin Labor Code, to the effect that employees are to have full freedom of association, self- organization, and designation of representative of their own choosing, free from interference, restraint, or coercion of their employers, puts this case outside the scope of both acts, since respondent cannot accede to the petitioners' demands upon it without disregarding the policy declared by the statutes. This view was expressed in the court's first opinion on the appeal from the issue of an interlocutory injunction,12 and the opinion on the appeal from the final order adopts what was said on the earlier appeal as the law of the case. We find nothing in the declarations of policy which narrows the definition of a labor dispute as found in the statutes. The rights of the parties and the jurisdiction of the federal courts are to be determined according to the express provisions applicable to labor disputes as so defined.\n Fifth. Since the courts below were of opinion that a labor dispute, as defined by state and federal statutes, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 331]\n\u00a0\n had not been shown, they did not pass on the questions of the legality, under the Wisconsin law, of the acts charged to have been done by the petitioners or the constitutionality of that law in legalizing any of such acts. As the case must go back for further proceedings, we express no opinion upon these questions.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER (dissenting).\n The opinion just announced reflects faithfully though quite nakedly the findings of fact. These and uncontradicted details disclose the circumstantial basis of the suit. Local No. 73 is an unincorporated labor union, never in any way related to respondent. None of its employees is a member of the union; all have definitely rejected the suggestion that they join it. In every legal sense, the union is a stranger both to respondent and its employees. Shortly before petitioners conspired to destroy respondent's business, one Joyce, of the American Federation of Labor, called by telephone respondent's vice president, Russell, at his Chicago office. The latter's uncontradicted narration of the conversation follows: 'Mr. Joyce ... said 'We are in Milwaukee and want you fellows to join our Union up there. They tell me up there you are the man I must see, to get a contract signed for Shinner & Company with the Butchers Union up there.' I told him I could not sign any contract with him, that our men had their own association and were perfectly well satisfied, and didn't want to belong to any other union. He said 'Well, I am going there tonight \n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 332]\n\u00a0\n and if you don't join I will declare war on you.' I said 'There is nothing I can do about it.' He said 'All right, the war is on, and may the best man win,' and he hung up.'\n Then followed a demand by the union that respondent compel its employees, on pain of dismissal from their employment, to join the union and constitute it their bargaining representative and agent. Respondent rightly declined to undertake any such interference with the liberty of its employees, but informed them that they were free to do as they saw fit. It left them wholly free to join or not to join the union; the union was left free to invite, urge, persuade, or induce them to join. Every one who respects the lawful exercise of individual liberty of action must regard the attitude of the respondent as being above criticism and beyond reproach. The opinion of the Court just announced does not suggest a contrary view.\n Under these circumstances, the union, in order to force respondent to coerce its employees, and in pursuance of a conspiracy to that end, publicly and falsely accused respondent of being unfair to labor in dealing with its employees; and by means of false placards and banners, and by picketing, molestation, annoyance, threats, and intimidation it prevented, and when this suit was brought was continuing to prevent, patrons and prospective patrons from dealing with respondent-all to the latter's serious and irreparable injury.\n\n 1. \nRespondent's business constitutes a property right; and the free opportunity of respondent and its customers to deal with one another in that business is an incident inseparable therefrom. It is hard to imagine a case which more clearly calls for equitable relief; and the court below rightly granted an injunction. Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 327\n, 42 S. Ct. 124, 127, 27 A.L.R. 375, and cases cited. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 333]\n\u00a0\n But here it is held that the decree conflicts with the Norris-La Guardia Act. That the action demanded by petitioners of respondent with respect to its employees, if taken, would have been morally indefensible is plain; that it would have been against the declared policy of the act is equally plain. That act, 29 U.S.C.  102, 29 U.S.C.A.  102,1 declares that, under prevailing conditions, the individual unorganized worker, 'though he should be free to decline to associate with his fellows' should 'have full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his own choosing,' and should 'be free from the interference, restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, in the designation of such representatives,' etc. This declaration of policy, as the introductory clause plainly recites, was intended as an \n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 334]\n\u00a0\n aid 'in the interpretation' of the act and 'in determining the jurisdiction and authority of the courts' under the act. If respondent had joined the conspiracy and yielded to the demand of the union, its action as an employer of labor unquestionably would have constituted an 'interference, restraint, or coercion' of its employees in the designation of their representatives, in the teeth of the declared policy of the act.\n The opinion of the Court asserts, however, that this definite declaration of policy in no way narrows the definition of the phrase 'labor dispute' found in substantive provisions of the act. But that statement cannot be intended to suggest that the declaration of policy does not affect the meaning and application of the words used, for the opening clause of that declaration is precisely to the contrary. Whether a labor dispute exists in a given case depends upon the facts; and in each case the phrase 'labor dispute' is to be interpreted in harmony with the declared policy of the act. That is the congressional mandate, and courts are required to observe it. In Takao Ozawa v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 178, 194\n, 43 S.Ct. 65, 67, we said: 'It is the duty of this Court to give effect to the intent of Congress. Primarily this intent is ascertained by giving the words their natural significance, but if this leads to an unreasonable result plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole, we must examine the matter further. We may then look to the reason of the enactment and inquire into its antecedent history and give it effect in accordance with its design and purpose, sacrificing, if necessary, the literal meaning in order that the purpose may not fail.' See, also, to the same effect, Heydenfeldt v. Daney Gold, etc., Co., \n93 \nU.S. 634\n, 638; Holy Trinity Church v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 457\n, 459 et seq., 12 S.Ct. 511; Fleischmann Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 349, 360\n, 46 S.Ct. 284, 289; Karnuth v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 231, 243\n, 49 S.Ct. 274, 278. The principle applies here with peculiar force; \n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 335]\n\u00a0\n for it is an unnatural assumption to suppose that Congress intended by general definition of the flexible term 'labor dispute' to annul its own very explicit declaration in respect to the policy to be observed by the courts in the administration of the act.\n The decision just announced ignores the declared policy of Congress that the worker should be free to decline association with his fellows, that he should have full freedom in that respect and in the designation of representatives, and especially that he should be free from interference, restraint, or coercion of employers. To say that a 'labor dispute' is created by the mere refusal of respondent to comply with the demand that it compel its employees to designate the union as their representative unmistakably subverts this policy and consequently puts a construction upon the words contrary to the manifest congressional intent.\n Moreover, the immediately preceding section of the act, 29 U.S.C.  101, 29 U.S.C.A.  101,2 provides that no restraining order or injunction in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute shall issue 'contrary to the public policy declared in this chapter.' Sections 101 and 102, taken together, constitute nothing less than an expression of the legislative will that the court shall enforce the public policy set forth in section 102 and shall have regard thereto in reaching a determination as to whether it has jurisdiction to issue an injunction in any particular case. Since the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 336]\n\u00a0\n whole aim of the injury here inflicted and threatened to be inflicted by the union was to compel respondent to influence and coerce its employees in the designation of their representatives, the acts of the union were in plain defiance of the declared policy of Congress, and find no support in its substantive provisions.\n\n 2. \nBut putting aside the congressional declaration of policy as an indication of meaning, and considering the phrase entirely apart, the facts of this case plainly do not constitute a 'labor dispute' as defined by the act. Undoubtedly 'dispute' is used in its primary sense as meaning a verbal controversy involving an expression of opposing views or claims. The act itself, 29 U.S.C.  113(c), 29 U.S.C.A.  113(c), so regards it: 'The term 'labor dispute' includes any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment,' etc. In this case, there was no interchange or consideration of conflicting views in respect of the settlement of a controversial problem. There was simply an overbearing demand by the union that respondent should do an unlawful thing and a natural refusal on its part to comply. If a demand by a labor union that an employer compel its employees to submit to the will of the union, and the employer's refusal, constitute a labor controversy, the highwayman's demand for the money of his victim and the latter's refusal to stand and deliver constitute a financial controversy.\n There being an utter lack of connection between the petitioners and respondent or its employees, the union was an intruder into the affairs of the employer and its employees. The union had the right to try to persuade the employees to join its organization; but persuasive methods failing, its right under the law in any manner to intermeddle came to an end. It lawfully could not coerce the employees to abandon their own organization and to join Local No. 73 any more than the employees could coerce the union to disband and its members to join \n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 337]\n\u00a0\n their organization. Otherwise, the worker would not 'be free,' as the act requires, 'to decline to associate with his fellows'; nor would he have 'full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of his own choosing.' Clearly the union could not be authorized by statute to resort to coercive measures directly against the employees to compel submission to its wishes, for that would be to give one group of workmen autocratic power of control in respect of the liberties of another group, in contravention of the Fifth Amendment as well as of the policy of Congress expressly declared in this act. And that being true, the attempt to coerce submission through constrained interference of the employer was equally unlawful.\n So far as concerns the question here involved, the phrase 'labor dispute' is the basic element of the act. For unless there was such a dispute-that is to say, a 'controversy'-the act does not even purport to limit the District Court's jurisdiction in equity. The phrase must receive a sensible construction in harmony with the congressional intent and policy. There can be no dispute without disputants. Between whom was there a dispute here? There was none between the union and respondent's employees; for the latter were considered by the union mere pawns to be moved according to the arbitrary will of the union. There was none between respondent and its employees; for they were in full accord. And finally there was none between the union and respondent; for it would be utterly unreasonable to suppose Congress intended that the refusal of a conscientious employer to transgress the express policy of the law should constitute a 'labor dispute' having the effect of bringing to naught not only the policy of the law, but the obligation of a court of equity to respect it and to restrain a continuing and destructive assault upon the property rights of the employer, as to which no adequate remedy at law existed. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 338]\n\u00a0\n 3. As to what constitutes a 'labor dispute' within the meaning of the Wisconsin statute, the interpretation put upon it by the highest court of that state is binding here. Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias, v. Meyer, \n265 \nU.S. 30, 32\n, 44 S.Ct. 432; Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo, \n298 \nU.S. 587, 609\n, 56 S.Ct. 918, 922, 103 A.L.R. 1445. But this Court authoritatively declares the meaning of acts of Congress and is required to decide for itself what constitutes a 'labor dispute,' which, within the meaning of the Norris-La Guardia Act, will have the effect of abridging the jurisdiction of a federal court.\n The things here found to have been done for the purpose of coercing respondent to compel its employees to join the union are not declared lawful by the Wisconsin statute or by the courts of that state. Cf. American Furniture Co. v. I.B. of T.C., etc., 222 Wis. 338, 268 N.W. 250, 106 A.L.R. 335; Senn v. Tile Layers Protective Union, 222 Wis. 383, 268 N. W. 270, 872. While this Court refrains from condemning the means employed by petitioners, the opinion contains nothing to suggest that their conduct was not wrongful and unlawful. The publicity and peaceful picketing declared legal by Wisconsin laws are utterly unlike the display of libelous signs, parade of pickets, false accusations, molestation, threats, and intimidation employed by the union, not on behalf of former or present employees of respondent, but to destroy the business of respondent. Here, by means everywhere held to be unlawful, the union carried on and was continuing to carry on a campaign of destruction in order to coerce respondent to deprive its employees of their right of freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing. That the Wisconsin statute does not attempt to make lawful the means employed by the union to impose its will upon respondent and its employees clearly appears from this Court's portrayal of that law in Senn v. Tile Layers Union, \n301 \nU.S. 468\n, 57 S.Ct. 857. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 339]\n\u00a0\n The opinion in that case states (\n301 \nU.S. 468\n, at page 478, 57 S.Ct. 857, 862): 'The judgment of the highest court of the state establishes that both the means employed and the end sought by the unions are legal under its law. ... The Legislature of Wisconsin has declared that 'peaceful picketing and patrolling' on the public streets and places shall be permissible 'whether engaged in singly or in numbers' provided this is done 'without intimidation or coercion' and free from 'fraud, violence, breach of the peace, or threat thereof.' The statute provides that the picketing must be peaceful; and that term as used implies not only absence of violence, but absence of any unlawful act. It precludes the intimidation of customers. It precludes any form of physical obstruction or interference with the plaintiff's business. It authorizes giving publicity to the existence of the dispute 'whether by advertising, speaking, patrolling any public street or any place where any person or persons may lawfully be'; but precludes misrepresentation of the facts of the controversy. And it declares that 'nothing herein shall be construed to legalize a secondary boycott.' ... Inherently, the means authorized are clearly unobjectionable. In declaring such picketing permissible, Wisconsin has put this means of publicity on a par with advertisements in the press. ... The picketing was peaceful. The publicity did not involve a misrepresentation of fact; nor was any claim made below that relevant facts were suppressed.'\n The state statute, defining 'labor disputes' and declaring the means that lawfully may be used against employers in such controversies, does not purport to make lawful either the end here sought by petitioners or the means they employed to attain it. Their purpose was not unionization of respondent's employees, for they already belonged to a labor organization of their own choosing. The purpose was to coerce the employees to join a particular organization which they had already repudiated. There \n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 340]\n\u00a0\n is nothing in the state or federal statutes that purports to give labor unions or individuals so contriving the status of party to a 'labor dispute.' Coercion of employees to surrender their freedom of self- organization is repugnant to both statute. Wis.Laws 1935, c. 551,  5. 29 U.S.C.  101, 102, 29 U.S.C.A.  101, 102. Cf. American Furniture Co. v. I.B. of T.C., etc., 222 Wis. 338, 268 N.W. 250, 106 A.L.R. 335; Senn v. Tile Layers Protective Union, 222 Wis. 383, 268 N.W. 270, 872; Senn v. Tile Layers Union, \n301 \nU.S. 468\n, 57 S.Ct. 857. There is no ground upon which petitioners' purpose in this case or the means employed to accomplish it can be supported as lawful.\n\n 4. \nThe case is a simple one. Respondent's employees had no connection with the union, and were unwilling to have any. The union, being unable to persuade the employees to assent to its wishes in that regard, undertook to subjugate them to its will by coercing an unlawful interference with their freedom of action on the part of the employer. If that is a 'labor dispute,' destructive of the historical power of equity to intervene, then the Norris-La Guardia Act attempts to legalize an arbitrary and alien state of affairs wholly at variance with those principles of constitutional liberty by which the exercise of despotic power hitherto has been curbed. And nothing is plainer under our decisions than that if the act does that, its effect will be to deprive the respondent of its property and business without due process of law, in contravention of the Fifth Amendment. Truax v. Corrigan, supra, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 327\n, 328 S., 42 S.Ct. 124, 127, 128, 27 A.L.R. 375.\n I am of opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals rightly held that this case discloses no 'labor dispute' within the meaning of the Norris-La Guardia Act; that the union's coercive attack upon respondent was unlawful under state law and in violation of the policy declared by the federal statute, and was properly enjoined; and that, there being no 'labor dispute' as defined by that act, its pro- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 323, 341]\n\u00a0\n visions as to allegations, proof, and findings do not apply. I would affirm the judgment.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Lauf v.

CO. v. BARBER CO.(1938)\nNo. 208\nArgued: December 14, 1937Decided: January 3, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 458, 459]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Samuel Ostrolenk, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. George J. Harding, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether the owner of a process patent may by suit for contributory infringement suppress competition in the sale of unpatented material to be used in practicing the process.\n The Barber Company brought, in the federal court for New Jersey, against the Leitch Manufacturing Company,1 this suit to enjoin the alleged contributory in- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 458, 460]\n\u00a0\n fringement of patent No. 1,684,671, dated September 18, 1928, by selling and delivering bituminous emulsion to a road builder, knowing that it was to be used in Newark in accordance with the method defined in the claims of the patent. Besides denying the validity of the patent, this further defense was interposed. It was insisted that the suit could not be maintained, even if the patent were valid, because to do so would give a limited monopoly of an unpatented staple article of commerce. The following facts were proved or admitted.\n The Barber Company and Leitch Manufacturing Company are competing manufacturers of bituminous emulsion-an unpatented staple article of commerce produced in the United States by many concerns and in common use by their customers for many purposes. By builders of macadam roads the emulsion has long been used as a coating for crushed stone and otherwise. With builders of cement concrete roads it has recently come into use for a film on the surface of the roadway to retard evaporation during curing. For the method of so retarding evaporation the Barber Company acquired the process patent sued on, and seeks to use it to secure a limited monopoly in the business of producing and selling the bituminous material for practicing and carrying out the patented method. The company does not itself engage in road building, or compete with road contractors. It does not seek to make road builders pay a royalty for employing the patented method. It does not grant to road builders a written license to use the process. \n2\n But it adopts a method of doing the business which is the prac- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 458, 461]\n\u00a0\n tical equivalent of granting a written license with a condition that the patented method may be practiced only with emulsion purchased from it. For any road builder can buy emulsion from it for that purpose, and whenever such a sale is made, the law implies authority to practice the invention. On the other hand the Barber Company sues as contributory infringer a competing manufacturer of this unpatented material who sells it to a road builder for such use. Thus, the sole purpose to which the patent is put is thereby to suppress competition in the production and sale of staple unpatented material for this use in road building.\n The District Court discussed, but found it unnecessary to pass upon, this defense, as it dismissed the bill on the ground that the patent was void. Barber Asphalt Co. v. Stulz-Sickles Co., 14 F.Supp. 212. The Court of Appeals sustained the validity of the patent; concluded that there was contributory infringement; held that maintenance of the suit was not forbidden by the rule declared in Carbice Corporation v. American Patents Development Corporation, \n283 \nU.S. 27\n, 51 S.Ct. 334; and directed that the District Court enter a decree adjudging the claims in issue valid and infringed, and awarding an accounting. 3 Cir., 89 F.2d 960. One judge dissented on the ground that the decree dismissing the bill should have been affirmed under the rule declared in the Carbice Case. A petition for certiorari limited to that question was applied for and granted, Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co., \n302 \nU.S. 673\n, 58 S.Ct. 30, 82 L.Ed . --.\n That the patent did not confer upon the Barber Company the right to be free from competition in supplying unpatented material to be used in practicing the invention was settled by the rule declared in the Carbice Case. That suit was likewise one to enjoin an alleged contributory infringer. The subject of the patent was a refrigerating transportation package in which the refrigerant to be used was solid carbon dioxide, or 'dry ice.' The sole business of the Dry Ice Corporation was \n\n[302 \nU.S. 458, 462]\n\u00a0\n to make and sell dry ice-which is unpatented material. It did not make or sell transportation packages in which dry ice was used as a refrigerant. It did not issue to other concerns licenses to make such packages upon payment of a stipulated royalty. It did not formally license buyers of its dry ice to use the invention in suit. But each invoice for dry ice bore a notice in effect that the patented container could be used only with dry ice purchased from the corporation. In declaring that relief must be denied the Court said:\n'The Dry Ice Corporation has no right to be free from competition in the sale of solid carbon dioxide. Control over the supply of such unpatented material is beyond the scope of the patentee's monopoly; and this limitation, inherent in the patent grant, is not dependent upon the peculiar function or character of the unpatented material or on the way in which it is used. Relief is denied because the Dry Ice Corporation is attempting, without sanction of law, to employ the patent to secure a limited monopoly of unpatented material used in applying the invention.' \n283 \nU.S. 27\n, at pages 33, 34, 51 S.Ct. 334, 336.\n\n'In the case at bar the plaintiffs neither sell nor license others to sell complete transportation packages. They supply merely one of the several materials entering into the combination; and on that commodity they have not been granted a monopoly. Their attempt to secure one cannot be sanctioned.' \n283 \nU.S. 27\n, at pages 34, 35, 51 S.Ct. 334, 336.\n\n The Barber Company contends that the rule of the Carbice Case is not applicable because it has not entered into any contract or agreement aimed at expansionof the patent monopoly. It argues that in the Carbice Case, as in Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., \n243 \nU.S. 502\n, 37 S.Ct. 416, L.R.A.1917E, 1187, Ann.Cas.1918A, 959, the attempt to secure the 'partial monopoly of an unpatented material, outside of and apart from the patent monopoly' was made by contract or notice, whereas the Barber Company has made no attempt \n\n[302 \nU.S. 458, 463]\n\u00a0\n 'by contract, notice or otherwise, to expand its patent monopoly by limitations, or to reserve or create any monopoly in emulsion outside of, and apart from, its patent monopoly'; that 'its customers for emulsion have no more than the unconditional license to use implied by law and are under no restriction;' and that neither the defendant nor its customers 'has any relation with the patent owner.'\n The distinction upon which the Barber Company thus rests is without legal significance. The Court held in the Carbice Case that the limitation upon the scope or use of the patent which it applied was 'inherent in the patent grant.' It denied relief, not because there was a contract or notice held to be inoperative, but on the broad ground that the owner of the patent monopoly, ignoring the limitation 'inherent in the patent grant,' sought by its method of doing business to extend the monopoly to unpatented material used in practicing the invention. By the rule there declared every use of a patent as a means of obtaining a limited monopoly of unpatented material is prohibited. It applies whether the patent be for a machine, a product, or a process. It applies whatever the nature of the device by which the owner of the patent seeks to effect such unauthorized extension of the monopoly. Nothing in Leeds & Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n213 \nU.S. 325\n, 29 S.Ct. 503, limits it.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of the case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The suit was begun by the Barber Asphalt Company, the then owner of the patent. During the pendency of the suit that corporation transferred the patent, together with all claims for damages and profits for past infringement and the right to sue therefor, to the Barber Company, Inc. Upon supplemental bill of complaint, it was substituted as plaintiff. The Stulz-Sickles Company, the jobber through whom the sale was made, was a codefendant throughout the proceedings below; but declined to join in the petition for certiorari. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] No written license had, so far as appears, been granted by the Barber Company to any one. Its predecessor, the Barber Asphalt Company ( see note 1), had granted a written license to Johnson-March Corporation, which paid no royalty but bought from the Barber Asphalt Company 'cutback material' for use in the East, the 'Trinidad or Bermudez asphalt' for use in the West. \n\n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLINCOLN ENGINEERING CO. v. STEWART-WARNER CORP.(1938)\nNo. 608\nArgued: March 10, 1938Decided: March 28, 1938\n\n\n\n Messrs. Leonard L. Kalish, of Philadelphia, Pa., Delos G. Haynes and Lloyd R. Koenig, both of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. Lynn A. Williams, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 545, 546]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The District Court1 and the Circuit Court of Appeals2 have held the petitioner guilty of contributory infringement of the Butler patent No. 1, 593,791. We granted certiorari, \n302 \nU.S. 682\n, 58 S.Ct. 410, 82 L.Ed. --, because of alleged conflict with our decision in Rogers v. Alemite Corporation reported with Bassick Manufacturing Co. v. Hollingshead Co., \n298 \nU.S. 415\n, 56 S.Ct. 787, 788. Like that in the Rogers Case, the patent in suit has to do with apparatus for lubricating bearings, especially those of automobiles, by the use of a nipple or fitting connected with the bearing, a gun consisting of a compressor or pump for propelling the lubricant under high pressure, a hose or conduit to connect the pump with the fitting, and a means of coupling the conduit to the fitting to make a tight joint during the operation of greasing. Both respondent and petitioner market apparatus for pressure lubrication, including fittings and guns. The charge is that the petitioner sells fittings such as are described in the respondent's patent which are usable, and intended to be used, in connection with the gun and coupler of the patent.\n What was said in our earlier decision in respect of the prior art need not be repeated. Butler's alleged invention is in the same field and deals with similar apparatus as did Gullborg's patent, considered in the Rogers Case. As there shown, it was old practice in the lubrication of bearings to use in combination a fitting connected with the bearing through which oil or grease was to be propelled into the bearing and a gun, which was joined to the fitting by a coupler. In the greasing operation the coupler is fastened to the head of the fitting and the pump is operated to drive the lubricant through the fitting to the bearing. Not only was this combination old but the elements long used in the art varied in design \n\n[303 \nU.S. 545, 547]\n\u00a0\n and dimension. Fittings were of different sizes and shapes and had diverse arrangements for their closure when not in actual use for the injection of lubricant. Guns were of many sizes and types. Various forms of coupler had been used for sealing the connection between the pump hose and the fitting. In the Rogers Case it appeared that fittings with lugs or pins to be engaged by the coupler were old but that Gullborg had obtained a patent for a new form of pin fitting, the novel feature of which was means of automatic closure and opening for admittance of the grease in connection with a pin which passed through the bore of the fitting. This was not the patent there in suit. Gullborg also obtained a patent in which the novel feature of certain claims was a bayonet-slotted coupler so designed as to cooperate with a pin fitting (including one of the type covered by his other patent), to permit the building up of very high pressure and, by its operation upon disengagement, to obviate exudation of grease about the head of the fitting. In other claims Gullborg claimed a combination of a pin fitting, of the type covered by his fitting patent, a pump, a discharge conduit secured to the pump, and a hollow coupling member of any type (whether old and unpatented or of the improved construction disclosed in the patent) for receiving the closed end of the fitting. In the Rogers Case the owner of the patent asserted the sale of any grease gun for use with the patented pin fitting of Gullborg, or the sale of any pin fitting, whether of the Gullborg type or of an old type, susceptible of use with the improved Gullborg coupler, constituted contributory infringement of the patent. We held that as the combination of pump, connecting conduit, coupler, and fitting was old, Gullborg could not, by inventing a new and improved type of coupler or fitting claim either of these in combination with the old forms of the other elements so as to exclude the public from the use and sale of the old \n\n[303 \nU.S. 545, 548]\n\u00a0\n forms of fittings or grease guns even though these might be used respectively with Gullborg's improved coupler or his improved pin fittings, because, in the combinations claimed, an old-type pin fitting, or an old- type coupler, had no novel function over those of the prior art. We said that, if Gullborg had invented anything, he had invented an improved pin fitting and an improved coupler and that to allow him to claim either in combination with old elements which performed no new function, would be to permit him to extend the monopoly of his invention to those old and well known devices.\n With this background we turn to the patent in suit. Like that of Gullborg, the claim is for a combination. It is as follows:\n'2. The combination with a headed nipple for receiving lubricant, of a lubricant compressor having a coupling member for connecting said compressor and nipple comprising a cylinder, a piston movable within the cylinder, and having an aperture for the discharge of lubricant thereof, an apertured sealing seat carried by said piston for engagement with the end of the nipple, connecting the piston aperture with a passage through the nipple, radially movable locking elements carried by the cylinder coacting with the nipple and actuated by said piston for compressively clutching the elements upon the nipple whereby the pressure of the lubricant on said piston will move the piston to forcibly compress said elements while the lubricant is passing through said connecting parts.'\n\n In its petition for certiorari, and in argument upon the merits, the petitioner insisted that the respondent's commercial form of coupler was not that of the Butler patent; that the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit Court had so held,3 and that the courts below erred in not reaching a similar conclusion. In view of the grounds \n\n[303 \nU.S. 545, 549]\n\u00a0\n of our decision we find it unnecessary to pass upon this question.\n The petitioner's principal contention is that our decision in the Rogers Case is controlling. \n4\n We so hold. As has been said, the combination of elements disclosed is old in the art. As the Circuit Court of Appeals held, a headed nipple or fitting connected with the bearing, and to be coupled to the conduit from the grease gun, is old and unpatentable. A compressor or pump for propelling lubricant is old and unpatentable as such. The invention, if any, which Butler made was an improvement in what he styles in his specifications the 'chuck' and in his claim a 'coupling member.' It is not denied that multi-jawed chucks had been used in industry and as couplers in lubricating apparatus. Butler may have devised a patentable improvement in such a chuck in the respect that the multiple jaws in his device are closed over the nipple by the pressure of the grease, but we think he did no more than this. As we said of Gullborg in the Rogers Case, having hit upon this improvement he did not patent it as such but attempted to claim it in combination with other old elements which performed no new function in his claimed combination. The patent is therefore void as claiming more than the applicant invented. The mere aggregation of a number of old parts or elements which, in the aggregation, perform or produce no new or different function or operation than that theretofore performed or produced by them, is not patentable invention. 5 And the improvement of one part of an old combination gives no right to claim that improvement in combination with other old \n\n[303 \nU.S. 545, 550]\n\u00a0\n parts which perform no new function in the combination. \n6\n Though the respondent so concedes, it urges that, in the combination of the Butler patent, the headed nipple performs a new and different function from that which it has heretofore performed, in other combinations, in that, when the coupler is withdrawn from the nipple, at the end of the greasing operation, the rounded head of the nipple 'cocks' the jaws of the coupler for the next operation. The suggestion seems to be an afterthought. No such function of the nipple is hinted at in the specifications of the patent. If this were so vital an element in the functioning of the apparatus, it is strange that all mention of it was omitted. 7 Moreover, the argument is unsound since the old art includes instances where the head of a nipple or fitting performs a similar function when the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 545, 551]\n\u00a0\n chuck is disengaged from it. The same argument was unavailing in the Rogers case. It was there contended that the pin fitting of the Gullborg patent performed a new function in causing the beneficial operation of the coupler at the moment of disengagement. We commented upon the matter thus: 'The design of the bayonet slots is such that, in uncoupling, the coupling member of the gun will at first be moved slightly forward on the pin fitting thus backing up the perforated washer in the bore of the coupler.' But there, as in the present case, it was the peculiar and improved mechanism of the coupler which brought about the result and not the form of the fitting. We suppose that a headed nipple has always been so headed in order that the jaws of the chuck may slip over the head in the coupling and uncoupling operation. The weakness of the respondent's position is well illustrated by what developed at argument. When interrogated as to how in the claimed combination the function of the nipple could be thought novel in any different sense than the function of the pump, counsel replied that the pump performed a novel function because the pressure it generated forced forward the piston in the coupler and caused the movable jaws to engage the fitting. If this argument is sound, the respondent may convict every one who sells a grease pump of contributory infringement. The answer is the same as in the case of the headed nipple. The function of a pump has always been to force a fluid or a grease through a conduit. The fact that this function of the pump is utilized in Butler's improved form of coupler not only to convey the lubricant to the bearing but to operate the jaws of the chuck does not alter the function of the pump. The invention, if any, lies in the improvement in the coupling device alone.\n The courts below and the respondent rely upon Leeds & Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co., 213 U.S. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 545, 552]\n\u00a0\n 301, 325, 29 S.Ct. 495. In the Rogers Case we held that authority not controlling. Berliner disclosed an entirely novel principle; he utilized the flat disc having a smooth bottomed groove with spiral waves in its sides not only to agitate the needle connected to the diaphragm, but, in combination with a swinging arm, to propel the needle lengthwise the groove. In his combination, the disc not only performed a new function but performed it in combination with another new element-the swinging arm which carried the needle.\n We conclude that Butler's effort, by the use of a combination claim, to extend the monopoly of his invention of an improved form of chuck or coupler to old parts or elements having no new function when operated in connection with the coupler renders the claim void.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES and Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Stewart-Warner Corp. v.

STATE OF TEXAS(1938)\nNo. 313\nArgued: March 28, 1938Decided: May 16, 1938\n\n\n\n As Amended May 31, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 226]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles L. Black, of Austin, Tex., and Marshall Newcomb, of Dallas, Tex., for appellant.\n Messrs. Alfred M. Scott, of Austin, Tex., and Edward H. Lange, of Laredo, Tex., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Railroad Commission of Texas brought this action, under article 6059 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, to enforce the Commission's order of September 13, 1933, prescribing the rate for domestic gas supplied by appellant, Lone Star Gas Company, to distributing companies in Texas. The rate was fixed at not to exceed 32 cents per thousand cubic feet instead of the existing charge of 40 cents. The district court of Travis county, upon the verdict of a jury finding the prescribed rate to be unreasonable, denied relief and enjoined the Commission and the state officials from enforcing the Commission's order. The Court of Civil Appeals reversed the judgment and held the order to be valid. 86 S.W.2d 484. Rehearing was denied. 86 S.W.2d 506. The Supreme Court of the State refused writ of error and the case comes here on appeal.\n Appellant, a Texas corporation, operates about 4,000 miles of pipe lines located in Texas and Oklahoma through which it transports natural gas to the 'city gates' of about 300 cities and towns in those States and sells and delivers the gas in wholesale quantities to distributing companies. The latter companies, with two exceptions, are affiliated with appellant, being subsidiaries of the same parent corporation. One of appellant's pipe lines extends from a gas field in Wheeler county, Tex., a part \n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 227]\n\u00a0\n of the Texas Panhandle field, crosses the southwestern corner of Oklahoma, is tapped for gas delivered at Hollis, Okl., and returning into Texas runs generally in a southeasterly direction to various Texas points. At Oklaunion, Tex., the line is tapped by a branch line which extends northward into Oklahoma and supplies certain cities in that State. At Petrolia, Tex., the line is joined by lines coming from Oklahoma.\n The Commission dealt solely with the rate for the gas delivered in Texas. This consisted (1) of gas produced or purchased in Texas and transported and delivered entirely within that State, being upwards of 70 per cent. of the total; (2) that produced or purchased in Oklahoma and transported through appellant's lines into Texas which, on appellant's calculation, amounted at the average of the five-year period 1929-1933 to about 11 per cent. of the total; and (3) that produced or purchased in the Panhandle field in Wheeler county, Tex., amounting on the same computation to about 17 per cent. of the total.\n The Commission gave a full hearing in which appellant participated. The Commission treated appellant's properties as an integrated system, and in that way 'considered the Oklahoma properties and operations and the efe ct thereof on the revenues and expenditures within Texas,' fixing the rate 'for application within the jurisdiction of Texas.' Appellant made no objection to that course. The Commission determined the rate base as of December 31, 1931, at $46,246,617.53, being $4,674,285.91 for production properties and $41,572,331.62 for transmission properties. The Commission considered appellant's revenues and expenses for a six-year period, 1927 to 1932, and made the rate on the basis of 6 per cent. as a minimum fair rate of return.\n Appellant brought suit in the federal court, attacking the rate on constitutional grounds, but that court stayed its proceedings when the present action was brought by \n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 228]\n\u00a0\n the Commission. In this action appellant first submitted pleas to the jurisdiction of the state court, and pleas in abatement, which were overruled. In its answer appellant attacked the rate order upon the grounds (1) that transportation and sales to local distributing companies through high-pressure lines 'of gas produced in Wheeler County, Texas, and transported into and through Oklahoma and back into Texas without interruption,' constituted interstate commerce, and that the order violated the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, art. 1,  8, cl. 3; and that the same was true of the gas produced or purchased by appellant in Oklahoma and transported in high-pressure lines to Texas for sale and delivery there; and (2) that the prescribed rate was confiscatory and repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The trial on the merits, before a jury, was begun on June 11, 1934, and was entirely de novo. The State introduced in evidence the Commission's order (to which appellant unsuccessfully objected as being void in its entirety because applicable to its interstate business), the stay order granted by the federal court, and a stipulation that the prescribed rate had not been put into effect. The record of evidence before the Commission was offered but was not received. On this formal proof the State rested. Appellant moved for a directed verdict which was denied and appellant then went forward with its evidence. The report and findings of the Commission upon which the order was based were introduced. In rebuttal of the Commission's findings, appellant submitted an appraisal of its properties as an integrated operating system as of January 1, 1933. That appraisal was voluminous, showing $73,983,405.57 as the cost of reproduction new. Evidence was offered as to the amount to be deducted for accrued depreciation and on that basis the fair value was claimed to be $ 69,738,021.16. The appraisal was later brought down to May 1, 1934, showing an increase in ma- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 229]\n\u00a0\n terial and construction costs between January 1, 1933, and May 1, 1934, of $ 1,579,381.72. The book costs of the properties were also introduced, ranging from $47,776,749.63, on December 31, 1931, to $49,858,751.23 as of April 30, 1934. Appellant claimed that the books understated the actual costs. There was evidence with respect to the annual accruals to provide for depreciation, depletion and amortization. The operating expenses and revenues were shown for the years 1931, 1932 and 1933, and for the twelve months ending April 30, 1934. In this evidence there was no segregation of appellant's properties or operations as between Texas and Oklahoma or between intrastate and interstate business, appellant insisting that it was entitled to attack the Commission's order upon the same inclusive basis which the Commission had used.\n The State insisted that, if appellant wished to maintain as a defense that the order was invalid because it sought to regulate operations which were exempt from state control, appellant should make a segregation, first as between its admittedly intrastate operations and those claimed to be interstate, and second, as between Texas and Oklahoma properties and operations. After the voluminous evidence above mentioned had been taken, appellant, still contending that such n issue was not properly raised as the action under the Texas statute was in the nature of an appeal from the Commission's order which was indivisible, presented evidence based upon 'a segregation of its 'integrated operating system' as between interstate and intrastate commerce.' Appellant states that this segregation was based 'upon the actual use of its properties in the two classes of commerce.' The fair value of its intrastate property was thus claimed to be $38,350, 882.32 and the net amount available at the Commission's rate for return on intrastate deliveries of gas at less than 4 per cent. In this segregation appellant's line used in trans- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 230]\n\u00a0\n porting gas from Wheeler county, Tex., in the Panhandle filed, through Oklahoma and thence into Texas, was allocated to interstate operations.\n In rebuttal, the State offered evidence based upon a different method of segregating appellant's properties and operations. This method proceeded upon the basis of geographical location, that is, there were allocated to Oklahoma and Texas respectively the properties physically located in each State and the revenues and expenses were divided on the same geographical basis. In that way the properties allocated to Texas were valued at $40,256,862.39, and the net revenue which would be available at the Commission's rate was estimated to be, for the last two years of the accounting period, nearly 7 per cent. Appellant complains of this appraisal upon the ground that it excluded the production properties located in Texas which appellant claimed had an actual cost of $5,191,539, 42 as of March 31, 1934, and that the State substituted therefor an arbitrary and inadequate annual allowance on the basis of the field price for the volume of gas produced.\n When the evidence was closed, each party moved that a verdict be directed in its favor and both motions were denied. The court gave to the jury a series of instructions embracing definitions of the terms of 'fair return,' 'fair value,' 'used and useful'-as applying to the property actually used by appellant in the production, transportation, sale and delivery of natural gas to its customers and also to the property acquired in good faith and held by appellant for use in the reasonably near future in order to enable it to furnish adequate and uninterrupted service- 'operating expenses,' 'annual depreciation,' 'reproduction cost new,' and 'going value.' The jury were instructed that the burden of proof was upon the defendant (appellant) 'to show by clear and satisfactory evidence' that the rate fixed by the Commission's order was 'un- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 231]\n\u00a0\n reasonable and unjust as to it,' and the court explained that by that phrase was meant that the rate prescribed in the Commission's order 'was so low as to have not provided for a fair return upon the fair value of defendant's property used and useful in supplying the service furnished by said defendant.' With these instructions the court submitted to the jury a single special issue as follows:\n'Do you find from the evidence in this case that, as applied to points in Texas, the order of the Railroad Commission of Texas, bearing date of September 13, 1933, providing for a rate of not exceeding 32 cents per thousand cubic feet of gas sold to the distributing companies at the gates of points served, is unreasonable and unjust as to the defendant, Lone Star Gas Company? Answer this question 'yes' or 'no.\"\n\n The jury answered the question 'yes.' Judgment was entered accordingly enjoining the enforcement of the Commission's rate.\n In view of the definition of 'fair return' and 'unreasonable and unjust' in the court's instructions, we are of the opinion that the issue for the jury to determine was in substance whether the rate was confiscatory. We so regarded a like submission in the case of United Gas Public Service Company v. Texas, \n303 \nU.S. 123\n, 58 S.Ct. 483, decided February 14, 1938. There the jury's verdict sustained the rate but that fact does not alter the nature of the issue sumi tted.\n Under the state practice the issues of fact were determined in the trial court and on the appeal the Court of Civil Appeals had no authority to make findings of fact. 'Where the evidence is without conflict, it may render judgment. But where there is any conflict in the evidence on a material issue, it has no authority to substitute its findings of fact for those of the trial court.' Post v. State, 106 Tex. 500, 501, 171 S.W. 707, 708; United Gas Public Service Company v. Texas, supra. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 232]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Civil Appeals held that the burden was heavily upon the Company (appellant here) to show by clear and satisfactory evidence that the 32-cent rate would not afford a reasonable rate of return on the property used in the Texas public service, that the Company did not meet 'this burden and quantum of proof,' and that the trial court erred in overruling the State's motions for an instructed verdict. The court viewed the appeal as presenting two main divisions, (1) certain constitutional objections to the rate order, and (2) the legal sufficiency of the evidence to show that the order was confiscatory or unreasonable and unjust. Under the first division, the court considered that there were three constitutional objections, (a) interference with interstate commerce , (b) interference with the right to contract, and (c) confiscation of property. The court sustained the jurisdiction of the Commission to deal with the operations of appellant and its corporate affiliates in Texas as 'a single and integrated business enterprise.' On the first two issues abovementioned the court ruled in favor of the State, and on the confiscation issue the court considered that the question whether the prescribed rate would yield a fair return was one of fact and passed to the consideration of the legal sufficiency of the evidence.\n Holding that the rate fixed by the Commission was presumed to be valid, and referring to the authorities as to the scope of judicial review, the court set forth the five primary factors essential to the correct determination of the issue, viz., the present fair value of the property of the Company used in the public service, the reasonable annual allowance for depreciation, the reasonably necessary operating expenses, the reasonable operating revenues, and the reasonable rate of return.\n But in dealing with the evidence upon these questions, the court applied a different criterion from that adopted by the Commission. The court held that it was necessary \n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 233]\n\u00a0\n to segregate the property used in Texas, as well as that used conjointly in Texas and Oklahoma. The court spoke definitely upon this point, saying ( page 501 of 86 S.W.2d):\n'Since appellee (appellant here) was engaged in the integrated business of producing, purchasing, transporting, and selling natural gas to the distributing companies at the city gates of some 300 cities and towns in Texas and Oklahoma, it became necessary to allocate or segregate the property used in Texas well as that used conjointly in both states, in order to determine the fair value of the property used in the Texas public service, the annual depreciation thereof, and the Texas operating expenses and revenue.'\n\n The court then set forth the different methods of segregation which the parties had adopted. The court said that the State's method allocated 'to Texas operations or to intrastate commerce the value of all property located within the physical boundary of Texas.' The 'short section' of pipe line 'from Texas Panhandle field across the corner of Oklahoma and back into Texas' was also allocated to Texas operations. 'Gas sales adjustment' was made by which 'Texas or intrastate operations' were charged with the net amount of Oklahoma produced gas for the six-year period 1929 to 1934. The court observed that 'No charge against Oklahoma or interstate operations was made for the use of the transmission lines and for equipment within Texas, the effect of which was to give free transportation in Texas of all Oklahoma produced gas.' Texas ad Oklahoma expenses and revenues 'were allocated in general accord with the segregation of the physical properties.' The court stated that under that method the fair value 'of the property undepreciated used in Texas public service was $40,256,862.39' according to the calculations of the State's experts; and that after deducting operating expenses and annual depreciation 'there remained for the last two years of the accounting period, \n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 234]\n\u00a0\n being the two lowest revenue years,' Texas net revenue 'which would yield a return of 6.74 per cent. and 6.76 per cent. respectively.'\n The court then referred to the method of segregation used by the Company by which all the gas produced or purchased in the Texas Panhandle field and transported into Texas, and all Oklahoma produced gas, were allocated to interstate commerce; that the allocation was made by a determination of the specific gravity of the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle gas on the one hand and the West Texas gas with which it was commingled in pipe lines on the other; that the Company had allocated operating expenses and revenue between the two States upon substantially the same basis; and that in this manner the fair value of the property used in the Texas public service on the basis of reproduction cost new, less depreciation, was said to be $38,350,882.32. The court held that gas from the Texas Panhandle field did not move in interstate commerce and hence that the testimony of the Company's experts was based upon an erroneous assumption and 'proved nothing material to this case'; that the Company had offered no other proof upon a correct segregation or allocation of the property; and that the trial court had erred in refusing the State's motion for an instructed verdict and for a judgment declaring the rate order 'to be valid in every respect.'\n The court's specific ruling upon this point is shown by the following statement of its conclusion:\n'The burden was upon appellee to show by clear and satisfactory evidence a proper segregation of interstate and intrastate properties and business, and to show the value of the property employed in intrastate business or commerce and the compensation it would receive under the rate complained of upon such valuation. Having failed to make a proper segregation of interstate and intrastate properties, appellee did not adduce the quantum \n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 235]\n\u00a0\n and character of proof necessary to establish the invalidity of the rate as being confiscatory, or unreasonable and unjust.'\n\n The court adverted to the effect of the difference in theory in the two methods of segregation 'with respect to the fair value of the property used in Texas public service, the annual depreciation thereof, and particularly as to the operating expenses and revenues.' The court characterized the annual depreciation allowances as speculative and plainly excessive. The court said that with respect to operating expenses, except as to a few controverted items, and with respect to revenues, there was no substantial difference in the testimony 'as to totals of both Texas and Oklahoma for the years of the accounting period,' but that the same controversy arose 'as to a proper segregation of such expenses and revenues to each state'; and since, as already pointed out, the Company had 'failed to make proper segregation of the expenses and revenues, it failed to prove its case.'\n The court then criticized certain items of operating expenses as contrary to the actual experiences of the Company or so large as to be excessive upon their face, referring in particular to the items of 'federal taxes,' management fees charged by the holding corporation, new business expenses, canceled and surrendered leases, regulatory commission and general expenses, and going value. The court also took the view that no reason existed why a 6 per cent. rate of return should be declared confiscatory.\n That the judgment of reversal was rested upon the proposition that there was a failure of proof on the issue of confiscation by reason of he fact that the Company had failed to make a proper segregation of its interstate and intrastate properties and operations is fully confirmed by the further opinion of the court in denying the Company's motion for a rehearing, when the court said:\n'We held that as a matter of law appellee failed to establish by clear and satisfactory evidence the ultimate \n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 236]\n\u00a0\n fact issue, to wit: Whether the rate fixed by the commission was so low as not to afford a reasonable return on the fair value of the property used in the Texas public service. Appellee was afforded a seven months' hearing before the commission and a three months' trial on appeal to the court. It made no segregation as between its Texas and Oklahoma properties and operations; and did not prove the fair value of the property used in the Texas public service. The question of the value of such property determines the reasonableness of the rate, and probably, in the ultimate analysis, adequacy of service and principles of financing.'\n\n The court added that the valuation of such public service property were in the main a matter of estimate or opinion; that a scientific standard of absolute value was unattainable; and that because of this uncertainty, except where the evidence clearly shows gross over or under valuation, or 'mistake, inequality or fraud' in the appraisal, the finding of value by an administrative commission is generally given finality and that this especially was the rule in the absence of an actual test under the new rate.\n First. We agree with the state court that the Commission's order did not violate the constitutional rights of appellant under the commerce clause.\n The Commission did not attempt to regulate the interstate transportation of gas. Compare Hanley v. Kansas City Southern Rwy. Co., \n187 \nU.S. 617\n, 23 S.Ct. 214; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Speight, \n254 \nU.S. 17\n, 141 S.Ct. 11; Missouri Pacific R.R. Co. v. Stroud, \n267 \nU.S. 404\n, 45 S.Ct. 243. Nor, in view of the circumstances in the instant case, can it be said that the Commission was undertaking to regulate sales and deliveries of gas in interstate commerce. Compare Missouri ex rel. Barrett v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., \n265 \nU.S. 298\n, 44 S.Ct. 544; People's Natural Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n270 \nU.S. 550\n, 46 S.Ct. 371; East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Commission, \n283 \nU.S. 465\n, 51 S.Ct. 499; State Tax Commission v. Interstate Natural \n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 237]\n\u00a0\n Gas Co., \n284 \nU.S. 41\n, 52 S.Ct. 62; State Corporation Commission v. Wichita Gas Co., \n290 \nU.S. 561\n, 54 S.Ct. 321. The distributing companies in Texas, with the exception of those at Waxahachie and Gainesville (the amount of deliveries there being negligible in comparison with appellant's total gas business), are appellant's affiliates. The Lone Star Gas Corporation, organized in Delaware, holds more than 99 per cent. of the capital stock of appellant and owns or controls a like proportion of the capital stock of the distributing companies. Thus, the latter companies and appellant are but arms of the same organization doing an intrastate business in Texas and the Commission is entitled to ascertain and determine what was a reasonable charge for the gas supplied through this organization to consumers within the State. Western Distributing Company v. Public Service Commission, \n285 \nU.S. 119, 124\n, 52 S.Ct. 283, 284; Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n292 \nU.S. 290, 295\n, 54 S. Ct. 647, 650; American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. United States, \n299 \nU.S. 232, 239\n, 57 S.Ct. 170, 173. It appears that there were pending before the Commission proceedings involving the reasonableness of the rates charged by the distributing companies to consumers in many communities in Texas, and in relation to those proceedings the Commission found it necessary to determine what would be a reasonable charge for the gas delivered by appellant toth e distributing companies at the 'city gates.' It was obviously to the convenience of both the Commission and appellant that this essential factor should be ascertained in a single proceeding and the Commission's investigation which led to the order now in question, was undertaken to that end. We think that appellant's sales and deliveries of gas in Texas to the distributing companies must be regarded as an essential part of the intrastate business in the conduct of which the appellant and the distributing companies were virtual departments of the same enterprise. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 238]\n\u00a0\n Appellant's pipe line from the Texas Panhandle field in Wheeler county led from production properties in Texas to distributing points in the same State. The fact that the line cut across a corner of Oklahoma did not make it any the less a part of the system serving Texas gas to communities in Texas. In ascertaining what would be a reasonable rate of charge for this Texas gas supplied to Texas consumers, it was not only fair but manifestly necessary to take into account the value of the production properties in Texas from which the gas was taken and also the value of the transmission line by which the gas was brought to the city gates of the Texas communities. It is futile to contend that in making its calculations on that basis the Commission was regulating interstate transportation or imposing any burden upon interstate commerce. The Hanley, Speight and Stroud Cases, supra, upon which appellant relies, are not in point. In seeking to assure a just determination of a reasonable charge for the sales and deliveries in the intrastate business in Texas, the State was protecting its local interests and its action was not in conflict with any federal regulation. Minnesota Rate Cases, Simpson v. Shepard, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 402\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.,N.S., 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18.\n We think that the value of the pipe line from the Texas Panhandle filed was properly included by the Commission in the rate base.\n With respect to the gas produced or purchased by appellant in Oklahoma and transported by its pipe lines to Texas, the state court observed that the Oklahoma gas was run through extraction plants in Texas, leaving the residue gas changed in its composition and with its heating value lowered; that large amounts of the Oklahoma gas were run through and stored in wells in Texas; that, passing into appellant's pipe line system, that gas was commingled with Texas gas and divided and redivided until it was impossible to trace or identify it by \n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 239]\n\u00a0\n volume at any city gate of delivery; that at various points before delivery its pressure was reduced and the gas allowed to expand; and that the amount of Oklahoma gas as a whole was negligible in comparison with the amount of the Texas gas with which it was mixed. Appellant refers to the testimony of its witness that the composition of the gas, after certain heavy hydrocarbons were removed at the gasoline plants, remained practically the same, that its forward movement was not stopped, and that not all of the gas coming from Oklahoma was stored in Texas. Appellant also contends that the state court erred in saying that only about 4 per cent. of its total gas came from Oklahoma, insisting that the correct figure was about 11 per cent. The discrepancy is apparently explained by the fact that the state court's figure was taken from the results of the year 1933 while that of the appellant is for the five years of its accounting period. It would seem, however, that the amount of the gas transported from Oklahoma into Texas was at a diminishing rate. Aside fom that, we think that the proved manner in which the gas from Oklahoma was treated and handled in Texas made it an integral part of the gas supplied to the Texas communities in appellant's intrastate business and that the Commission was entitled so to consider it in fixing its rate.\n It is in this light that the inclusion by the Commission in its calculations of appellant's producingpr operties in Oklahoma and its transmission lines to Texas must be considered. The purpose of these calculations was to give proper credit to appellant for its investment and operating expenses in determining a rate for the gas sold and delivered in Texas. The Commission did not attempt to fix rate for gas supplied to Oklahoma communities and did not impinge upon the jurisdiction of Oklahoma. There is no ground for concluding that the Commission's \n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 240]\n\u00a0\n method of calculation either created any burden upon interstate commerce or operated to appellant's injury in relation to its intrastate business in Texas. Not only is the contrary a fair inference from the fact that appellant raised no objection to this method before the Commission, but the State points to the evidence which appears to show that the Oklahoma operations were more expensive than those in Texas and that the Commission's calculations actually produced a result more favorable to appellant than one which would have followed any segregation. Appellant does not successfully meet this contention.\n Second. Concluding that appellant had no tenable objection to the method adopted by the Commission in treating appellant's property as an integrated operating system, and making its findings as to value, expenses, and revenues accordingly, for the purpose of determining the fair rate for the gas sold and delivered in Texas, we come to the issue of confiscation.\n The Commission's order was presumptively valid, as the state court held, but it was open to attack in this action under the state statute. Appellant was entitled to present evidence to rebut the Commission's findings of value, operating expenses, revenues and return, upon which the order rested. Appellant presented much testimony and elaborate statistical data for that purpose, treating its property and business as the Commission had treated them. Appellant claimed that this evidence showed a far higher value for its properties than the Commission had allowed and that the rate imposed was confiscatory. The trial court submitted that evidence to the jury, under a proper instruction as to the burden of proof resting upon appellant, and the jury found in appellant's favor.\n The Court of Civil Appeals reversed the judgment upon a distinct ground. That was that appellant had not sus- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 241]\n\u00a0\n tained its burden of proof because it had failed to make 'a proper segregation of interstate and intrastate properties and business.' Thus, the necessity for that segregation was made the criterion. That is clearly shown both from the court's main opinion and its opinion upon rehearing from which we have quoted. 'Having failed to make a proper segregation of interstate and intrastate properties,' said the court, 'appellee ( appellant here) did not adduce the quantum and character of proof necessary to establish the invalidity of the rate as being confiscatory, or unreasonable and unjust.'\n We think that this ruling as to the necessity of segregation, and that the sufficiency of appellant's evidence should be determined by that criterion, was erroneous. This was not a case where the segregation of properties and business was essential in order to confine the exercise of state power to its own proper province. Compare Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Company, \n282 \nU.S. 133, 148\n, 149 S., 51 S.Ct. 65, 68, 69. Here, as we have seen, the Commission in its method of dealing with the property and business of appellant as an integrated operating system did not transcend the limits of the state's jurisdiction or apply an improper criterion in its determinations. But if in the circumstances shown the Commission was entitled to make its findings with respect to appellant's property and business upon the basis it adopted in order to fix a fair rate for the sales and deliveries in Texas, appellant was entitled to assail those findings upon the same basis. If the findings of the Commission as to value and other basic elements were to be taken as presumptively correct an a ppellant could not succeed save by overcoming those determinations by clear and convincing proof, appellant could not be denied the right to introduce evidence as to its property and business as an integrated system and to have the sufficiency of its evidence ascertained by the criterion which the Commission had prop- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 224, 242]\n\u00a0\n erly used in the same manner in reaching its conclusion as to the Texas rate. Neither the fact that appellant, because of the insistence of the State that the property and business should be segregated, finally introduced evidence for that purpose, nor the inadequacy of its method of segregation, could detract from the force of the proof it had already submitted in direct rebuttal of the Commission's findings. The effort at segregation came after voluminous testimony had been taken which fully presented appellant's case with respect to the value of its property and the result of its operations as an integrated system and the bearing of this evidence upon the contested rate. This proof could not be ignored because of a futile attempt, in response to the State's pressure, to find an alternative ground to support the attack upon the Commission's order. The first and primary ground remained and the determination of the court of first instance as the trier of the facts that the Commission's rate was confiscatory could not properly be set aside by the application of an untenable standard of proof and in disregard of the evidence which had been appropriately addressed to the Commission's findings and had been properly submitted to the jury.\n The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice BLACK dissents.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n304 \nU.S. 590\n, 58 S.Ct. 1051, 82 L.Ed. --.[ Lone Star Gas Co. v.

Albert Woll, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In the District Court, Western District of Washington, the petitioner was convicted of violating section 215, Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A.  338, by using the mails for fraudulent purposes. He appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, and filed-August 14, 1936-forty assignments of error. The judgment of conviction was affirmed March 6, 1937, upon an opinion, 9 Cir., 88 F.2d 591, 594, which, among other things, states: \n\n[303 \nU.S. 33, 34]\n\u00a0\n 'Twenty-eight assignments (numbered 5, 9 to 25, inclusive, and 31 to 40, inclusive) are to the admission of and refusal to strike out evidence. The assignments do not indicate that any of this evidence was objected to in the trial court. They do not state what objections, if any, were made, nor the grounds thereof, nor the grounds, if any, on which appellant moved to strike out the evidence. Such assignments do not conform to our rule 11 and will not be considered. Cody v. United States (C.C.A.9) 73 F.(2d) 180, 184; Goldstein v. United States (C.C.A.9) 73 F.(2d) 804, 806.'\n This ruling we think was error. Through wrongful interpretation and application of the rule petitioner was denied a proper hearing.\n At the date of the appeal the pertinent portion of rule 11 read as follows: 'When the error alleged is to the admission or the rejection of evidence the assignment of errors shall quote the full substance of the evidence admitted or rejected.'\n Concerning this provision, the opinion in Goldstein v. United States, 1934, 9 Cir., 73 F.2d 804, 806, declared: 'The assignment of error must not only quote 'the full substance of the evidence admitted or rejected,' but it must also state the error asserted and intended to be urged. This requires that the objection and ruling of the court upon the objection and the exception to the ruling be incorporated in the assignment of error.' Adhering to this interpretation, the court persistently refused to consider assignments deemed not in conformity therewith.\n Between the appeal and announcement of the opinion under consideration, rule 11 was amended so as to provide: 'When the error alleged is to the admission or rejection of evidence the assignment of error shall quote the ground urged at the trial for the objection and the exception taken and the full substance of the evidence admitted or rejected.' \n\n[303 \nU.S. 33, 35]\n\u00a0\n Manifestly petitioner had the right to rely upon the rule, properly construed, as it stood at the time of his appeal-before the amendment. And if analysis of one of the rejected assignments discloses substantial compliance, the cause must go back for further consideration of the record.\n Litigants may not be deprived of a hearing upon their points by wrongful construction of rules nor by their arbitrary application. An unwarranted construction has been given to the language of rule 11; properly interpreted, it did not require petitioner to do all the things specified by the amendment.\n The substance of assignment No. XVI follows:\n'The court erred in admitting in evidence, and denying defendant's motion to strike, to which exceptions were taken and allowed, plaintiff's Exhibit No. 75, being a letter on the letterhead of Battle, Hulbert, Helsell & Bettens, as follows:' (This letter-a long one-dated August 17, 1934, addressed to petitioner and signed Battle, Hulbert, Helsell & Bettens, by Joseph E. Gandy, is set out in full. It states, among other things, that certain 'allegations and persuasions' made by the petitioner to one Atwood 'were obviously fraudulently made' and that one 'Atwood was defrauded by the misrepresentations,' etc.)\n\n'The testimony in support of its admission given by witnesses A. M. Atwood and Joseph Gandy, is substantially as follows.' (Here follows a re sume of the testimony given by these witnesses.)\n\n'The reasons such Exhibit should not have been admitted, and that it should have been stricken, are as follows:\n\n'1. It was hearsay evidence, contained conclusions of third parties, and happened subsequent to the termination of the alleged plan.\n\n'2. It was a self serving statement of a third party making the statements therein contained. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 33, 36]\n\u00a0\n\n'3. It was highly incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and in its nature highly prejudicial to the defendant. Its admission was not necessary to clarify 76-A and it was not related to 76-B.'\n\n\n We think this assignment adequately met the applicable requirements of rule 11. Clearly, it quoted the full substance of the evidence admitted and was definite enough to enable both court and opposing counsel readily to perceive the point intended to be relied on. Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. Watson, \n287 \nU.S. 86, 91\n, 53 S.Ct. 32, 34, 86 A.L.R. 174.\n Other assignments also seem sufficiently definite and formal to demand consideration. We do not pass upon the merits of any assignment and decide only that some, if not all, of them were improperly rejected.\n The challenged judgment must be reversed. The cause will be remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings in harmony with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","91":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOVELL v. CITY OF GRIFFIN, GA.(1938)\nNo. 391\nArgued: Decided: March 28, 1938\n\n\n\n Mr. O. R. Moyle, of Brooklyn, N.Y., for appellant.\n Messrs. Hughes Spalding and Sumter M. Kelley, both of Atlanta, Ga., for respondent. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 444, 447]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, Alma Lovell, was convicted in the recorder's court of the City of Griffin, Ga., of the violation of a city ordinance and was sentenced to imprisonment for fifty days in default of the payment of a fine of $50. The superior court of the county refused sanction of a petition for review; the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the superior court, 55 Ga.App. 609, 191 S.E. 152; and the Supreme Court of the state denied an application for certiorari. The case comes here on appeal.\n The ordinance in question is as follows:\n'Section 1. That the practice of distributing, either by hand or otherwise, circulars, handbooks, advertising, or literature of any kind, whether said articles are being delivered free, or whether same are being sold, within the limits of the City of Griffin, without first obtaining written permission from the City Manager of the City of Griffin, such practice shall be deemed a nuisance, and punishable as an offense against the City of Griffin.\n\n'Section 2. The Chief of Police of the City of Griffin and the police force of the City of Griffin are hereby required and directed to suppress the same and to abate \n\n[303 \nU.S. 444, 448]\n\u00a0\n any nuisance as is described in the first section of this ordinance.'\n\n The violation, which is not denied, consisted of the distribution without the required permission of a pamphlet and magazine in the nature of religious tracts, setting forth the gospel of the 'Kingdom of Jehovah.' Appellant did not apply for a permit, as she regarded herself as sent 'by Jehovah to do His work' and that such an application would have been 'an act of disobedience to His commandment.'\n Upon the trial, with permission of the court, appellant demurred to the charge and moved to dismiss it upon a number of grounds, among which was the contention that the ordinance violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States in abridging 'the freedom of the press' and prohibiting 'the free exercise of petitioner's religion.' This contention was thus expressed:\n'Because said ordinance is contrary to and in violation of the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which reads:\n\n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.'\n\n'Said ordinance is also contrary to and in violation of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which had the effect of making the said first amendment applicable to the States, and which reads:\n\n\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States, and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United \n\n[303 \nU.S. 444, 449]\n\u00a0\n States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.'\n\n'Said ordinance absolutely prohibits the distribution of any literature of any kind within the limits of the City of Griffin without the permission of the City Manager and thus abridges the freedom of the press, contrary to the provisions of said quoted amendments.\n\n'Said ordinance also prohibits the free exercise of petitioner's religion and the practice thereof by prohibiting the distribution of literature about petitioner's religion in violation of the terms of said quoted amendments.'\n\n The Court of Appeals, overruling these objections, sustained the constitutional validity of the ordinance, saying: 'The said ordinance is not unconstitutional because it abridges the freedom of the press or prohibits the distribution of literature about petitioner's religion in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.'\n While in a separate paragraph of its opinion the court said that the charge that the ordinance was void because it violated a designated provision of the State or Federal Constitution without stating wherein there was such a violation, was too indefinite to present a constitutional question, we think that this statement must have referred to other grounds of demurrer and not to the objection above quoted, which was sufficiently specific and was definitely ruled upon. The contention as to restraint 'upon the free exercise of religion,' with respect to the same ordinance, was presented in the case of Coleman v. City of Griffin, 55 Ga.App. 123, 189 S.E. 427, and the appeal was dismissed (October 11, 1937) for want of a substantial federal question, \n302 \nU.S. 636\n, 58 S.Ct. 23, 82 L.Ed. --; Reynolds v. United States, \n98 \nU.S. 145, 166\n, 167 S.; Davis \n\n[303 \nU.S. 444, 450]\n\u00a0\n v. Beason, \n133 \nU.S. 333, 342\n, 343 S., 10 S.Ct. 299. But, in the Coleman Case, the court did not deal with the question of freedom of speech and of the press as it had not been properly presented. We think that this question was adequately presented and was decided in the instant case. Whether it was so presented and was decided is itself a federal question. Carter v. Texas, \n177 \nU.S. 442, 447\n, 20 S.Ct. 687; Ward v. Board of Com'rs of Love County, \n253 \nU.S. 17, 22\n, 40 S.Ct. 419, 421; First National Bank v.

This Court has jurisdiction.\n Freedom of speech and freedom of the press, which are protected by the First Amendment from infringement by Congress, are among the fundamental personal rights and liberties which are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action.

See, also, Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319\n, 58 S.Ct. 149, decided December 6, 1937. It is also well settled that municipal ordinances adopted under state authority constitute state action and are within the prohibition of the amendment. Raymond v. Chicago Union Traction Co., \n207 \nU.S. 20\n, 28 S.Ct. 7, 12 Ann.Cas. 757; Home Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Los Angeles, \n227 \nU.S. 278\n, 33 S.Ct. 312; Cuyahoga River Power Company v. Akron, \n240 \nU.S. 462\n, 36 S.Ct. 402.\n The ordinance in its broad sweep prohibits the distribution of 'circulars, handbooks, advertising, or literature of any kind.' It manifestly applies to pamphlets, magazines, and periodicals. The evidence against appellant was that she distributed a certain pamphlet and a magazine called the 'Golden Age.' Whether in actual administration the ordinance is applied, as apparently it could be, to newspapers does not appear. The city manager testified that 'every one applies to me for a \n\n[303 \nU.S. 444, 451]\n\u00a0\n license to distribute literature in this City. None of these people ( including defendant) secured a permit from me to distribute literature in the City of Griffin.' The ordinance is not limited to 'literature' that is obscene or offensive to public morals or that advocates unlawful conduct. There is no suggestion that the pamphlet and magazine distributed in the instant case were of that character. The ordinance embraces 'literature' in the widest sense.\n The ordinance is comprehensive with respect to the method of distribution. It covers every sort of circulation 'either by hand or otherwise.' There is thus no restriction in its application with respect to time or place. It is not limited to ways which might be regarded as inconsistent with the maintenance of public order, or as involving disorderly conduct, the molestation of the inhabitants, or the misuse or littering of the streets. The ordinance prohibits the distribution of literature of any kind at any time, at any place, and in any manner without a permit from the city manager.\n We think that the ordinance is invalid on its face. Whatever the motive which induced its adoption, its character is such that it strikes at the very foundation of the freedom of the press by subjecting it to license and censorship. The struggle for the freedom of the press was primarily directed against the power of the licensor. It was against that power that John Milton directed his assault by his 'Appeal for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing.' And the liberty of the press became initially a right to publish 'without a license what formerly could be published only with one.' \n1\n While this freedom from previous restraint upon publication cannot be regarded as exhausting the guaranty of liberty, the prevention of that restraint was a leading purpose in the adoption of the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 444, 452]\n\u00a0\n constitutional provision. See Patterson v. Colorado, \n205 \nU.S. 454, 462\n, 27 S.Ct. 556, 10 Ann.Cas. 689; Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697\n, 713-716, 51 S.Ct. 625, 630; Grosjean v. American Press Company, \n297 \nU.S. 233, 245\n, 246 S., 56 S.Ct. 444, 447. Legislation of the type of the ordinance in question would restore the system of license and censorship in its baldest form.\n The liberty of the press is not confined to newspapers and periodicals. It necessarily embraces pamphlets and leaflets. These indeed have been historic weapons in the defense of liberty, as the pamphlets of Thomas Paine and others in our own history abundantly attest. The press in its connotation comprehends every sort of publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion. What we have had recent occasion to say with respect to the vital importance of protecting this essential liberty from every sort of infringement need not be repeated. Near v. Minnesota, supra; Grosjean v. American Press Company, supra; De Jonge v. Oregon, supra. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The ordinance cannot be saved because it relates to distribution and not to publication. 'Liberty of circulating is as essential to that freedom as liberty of publishing; indeed, without the circulation, the publication would be of little value.' Ex parte Jackson, \n96 \nU.S. 727\n, 733. The license tax in Grosjean v. American Press Company, supra, was held invalid because of its direct tendency to restrict circulation.\n As the ordinance is void on its face, it was not necessary for appellant to seek a permit under it. She was \n\n[303 \nU.S. 444, 453]\n\u00a0\n entitled to contest its validity in answer to the charge against her. Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 \nU.S. 553, 562\n, 51 S.Ct. 582, 585\n\n\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Judgment conformed to 197 S.E. 347.[ Lovell v.

UNITED STATES(1938)\nNo. 864\nArgued: April 29, 1938Decided: May 16, 1938\n\n\n\n Messrs. John E. Hughes, of Chicago, Ill., and William Cogger, of Washington, .C ., for petitioner.\n Mr. A. F. Prescott, of Washington, D.C., for the United States. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 302, 303]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether the District Courts of the United States have jurisdiction, under section 24(20) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(20), of a suit brought against the United States to recover income and excess profits taxes in an amount in excess of $10,000 when the recovery sought is of an overpayment of taxes for one year, effected by crediting against a barred deficiency for that year an overpayment for another year.\n Petitioner1 overpaid income and excess profits taxes for 1918. The Commissioner, on May 15, 1924, signed a schedule of overpayments by which he approved a credit as of April 24, 1924, of a part of the 1918 overpayment, in an amount exceeding $10,000, against a tax deficiency of petitioner for 1917, the collection of which was then barred by the statute of limitations. The collector in office in 1924, when the credit was allowed, having retired, petitioner brought the present suit against the United States, in the District Court for Southern Ohio, to recover the amount of the credit. The petition alleges overpayment of the 1917 tax by reason of the credit, and demands its recovery. Petitioner has neither alleged nor proved any claim for refund of the 1918 overpayment, recovery of which, without such claim, was barred by limitation.\n The trial court, construing the suit as one to recover an overpayment of 1917 taxes, as petitioner conceded in open court, gave judgment dismissing the petition on the ground that the credit of the 1918 overpayment upon the barred deficiency for 1917 was not a payment of the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 302, 304]\n\u00a0\n 1917 tax since the credit is 'void' under the applicable sections, 607 and 609, of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A.  1670(a)(2), 1675. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed on a different ground, holding that the District Court was without jurisdiction, under the provisions of section 24(20) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  41(20), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(20), which confers jurisdiction on the District Court of suits against the United States to recover taxes erroneously assessed or collected in excess of $10,000, only if the collector by whom the tax was collected is dead or is not in office when the suit is brought. 92 F.2d 905. We granted certiorari, \n303 \nU.S. 633\n, 58 S.Ct. 831, 82 L.Ed. --, upon a petition presenting the single question of the jurisdiction of the District Court, in order to resolve an asserted conflict between the decision below and that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in United States v. Piedmont Mfg. Co., 89 F.2d 296.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, following United States v. Piedmont Manufacturing Co., supra, and its own decision in United States v. John Gallagher Co., 6 Cir., 83 F.2d 368, thought that the credit of the 1918 overpayment of the 1917 tax was not void, but voidable only at the election of the taxpayer and was consequently an overpayment of 1917 taxes for which recovery might be had in a court having jurisdiction. But following its own decision in United States v. Reeves Bros. Co., 6 Cir., 83 F.2d 121, and that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Moses v. United States, 61 F.2d 791, it held that the District Court was without jurisdiction because the collection of the 1917 tax, effected by the allowance of the credit, was not made by a collector and thus did not satisfy the jurisdictional requirement.\n The Court of Claims has jurisdiction of suits against the United States brought to recover internal revenue taxes erroneously collected without regard to the amount involved. Section 145, Jud.Code, 28 U.S.C.  250, 28 U.S.C.A.  250. Before the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 302, 305]\n\u00a0\n amendment of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 311 (continued by Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 348, and, so far as now material, in the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 121), section 24(20) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(20), gave jurisdiction to the District Courts, concurrent with the Court of Claims, of suits against the United States to recover 'claims not exceeding ten thousand dollars founded upon ... any law of Congress ... or upon any contract, express or implied, with the Government of the United States ....' Chapter 231, 36 Stat. 1093. Both before and after the amendment, District Courts also had jurisdiction of suits against a collector of internal revenue brought to recover, in any amount, internal revenue taxes which he had erroneously collected. Section 24(5), Jud.Code, 28 U.S.C.  41(5), 28 U.S.C.A. s 41(5). Such suits brought against the collector survive his retirement from office and do not abate upon his death. Patton v. Brady, \n184 \nU.S. 608\n, 22 S.Ct. 493; Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., \n257 \nU.S. 1\n, 42 S.Ct. 1; Union Trust Co. v. Wardell, \n258 \nU.S. 537\n, 42 S.Ct. 393.\n By the amendment of section 24(20), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(20), the jurisdiction of District Courts was extended so as to embrace suits against the United States to recover taxes 'even if the claim exceeds $10, 000, if the collector of internal revenue by whom such tax ... was collected is dead or is not in office as collector of internal revenue at the time such suit or proceeding is commenced.' Since the suit allowed against the collector before the amendment was based on his personal liability, Sage v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 33\n, 39 S.Ct. 415; Smietanka v. Indiana Steel Co., supra, no such suit will lie unless he has collected the tax. The obvious purpose of the amendment was to permit a substitution of a suit against the United States for the suit previously allowed against the collector whenever the amount claimed exceeds $10,000 and the collector is out of office. This is made evident by the words of the amendment which authorize the substitution only when the collection is made by the collector when in office. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 302, 306]\n\u00a0\n As we think it plain that no suit could have been maintained against the collector to recover the alleged overpayment, it follows that the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the present suit. If the 1917 tax can be said to have been collected at all, as to which we express no opinion, it was collected by the action of the Commissioner in crediting against the 1917 deficiency the 1918 overpayment. In 1924, the year of the claimed overpayment, the collector received no overpayment of petitioner's tax for any year. If the 1917 taxes were then collected it was by virtue of the application to the 1917 deficiency of moneys already in the treasury. The collector was without authority to make such application. It was the Commissioner's approval of the schedule of overpayments which was effective for that purpose. Girard Trust Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 163, 170\n, 171 S., 46 S.Ct. 229, 232; United States v. Swift & Co., \n282 \nU.S. 468\n, 51 S.Ct. 202. The certification of the overpayment by the collector to the Commissioner, a mere ministerial act, could subject the collector to no personal liability.\n It is true that under the statutes of the United States the collector is relieved from the personal liability except in the case where the District Court is of opinion that he acted without probable cause, Sage v. United States, supra, page 37, 39 S.Ct., page 416, and that such suits against the collector are commonly but a means of collecting the overpayment from the United States. Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, \n289 \nU.S. 373, 382\n, 53 S.Ct. 620, 623. But no statute has enlarged the collector's common-law liability to suit, and we cannot ignore the words of the amendment of section 24(20), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(20), which, in providing for a suit against the United Staes in lieu of one against the collector, make collection by him the sine qua non of jurisdiction.\n Graham & Foster v. Goodcell, \n282 \nU.S. 409\n, 51 S.Ct. 186, did not deal with the point here considered. The only one of the several cases decided there involving a credit of an over- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 302, 307]\n\u00a0\n payment for one year against a deficiency for another, Boston Pressed Metal Co. v. United States, 42 F.2d 312, was a suit brought in the Court of Claims for less than $10,000.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As petitioner stands in the place of its corporate predecessor by virtue of a merger, and as their rights and interests in the present suit may be treated as identical, both will be referred to as 'petitioner.' \n\n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLYETH v. HOEY(1938)\nNo. 48\nArgued: November 16, 1938Decided: December 5, 1938\n\n\n\n Mr. J. M. Richardson Lyeth, of New York City, for petitioner. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 188, 189]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and James W. Morris, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented is whether property received by petitioner from the estate of a decedent in compromise of his claim as an heir is taxable as income under the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 173.\n Petitioner is a grandson of Mary B. Longyear who died in 1931, a resident of Massachusetts, leaving as her heirs four surviving children and the petitioner and his brother, who were sons of a deceased daughter. By her will, the decedent gave to her heirs certain small legacies and the entire residuary estate, amounting to more that $3,000,000, was bequeathed to trustees of a so-called Endowment Trust, created April 5, 1926, the income from which was payable to another set of trustees under another trust described as the Longyear Foundation. The main purpose of the latter trust was to preserve 'the records of the earthly life of Mary Baker Eddy,' the founder of the Christian Science religion.\n When the will was offered for probate in Massachusetts there was objection by the heirs upon the grounds, among others, of lack of testamentary capacity and undue influence. After hearing, at which a statement was made by the respective parties of their proposed evidence, the probate court granted a motion for the framing of issues for trial before a jury. In that situation a compromise agreement was entered into between the heirs, the legatees, the devisees and the executors under the will and the Attorney General of Massachusetts. This agreement provided that the will should be admitted to probate and letters testamentary issued; that the specific and \n\n[305 \nU.S. 188, 190]\n\u00a0\n pecuniary bequests to individuals should be enforced; that the bequest of the residuary estate to the Endowment Trust should be disregarded; that $ 200,000 should be paid to the heirs and a like amount to the Endowment Trust, and that the net residue of the estate, as defined, should be equally divided between the trustees of the Endowment Trust and the heirs. The net residue to which the heirs were thus entitled was to be payable in units of stock owned by the decedent in certain corporations, Longyear Estate, Inc., Longyear Corporation and Longyear Realty Corporation, and for that purpose a unit was to consist of three shares, one share of each corporation.\n The compromise was approved by the probate court pursuant to a statute of Massachusetts (Mass.Gen.Laws (Ter.Ed.) 1932, Chap. 204, Secs. 15-17) and a decree was entered on April 26, 1932, admitting the will to probate, issuing letters testamentary to the executors and directing them 'to administer the estate of said deceased in accordance with the terms of said will and said agreement of compromise'. Owing to the depression and the necessity of discharging pecuniary legacies amounting to about $300, 000, which were entitled to priority in payment before distribution of the residue, the heirs undertook to finance one-half of these legacies and the residuary legatees the other one-half. For this purpose the heirs formed a corporation known as Longyear Heirs, Inc., to which they assigned their interests in the estate in exchange for common stock. Preferred stock was issued to the pecuniary legatees.\n In July, 1933, the executors distributed to Longyear Heirs, Inc., as assignee of the petitioner, his distributable share of the estate consisting of $80.17 in cash and a certificate of deposit for 358 units, each unit representing one share of each of the three corporations mentioned in the compromise agreement. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue valued this distributable share at $141,484.03 \n\n[305 \nU.S. 188, 191]\n\u00a0\n and treated the whole amount as income for the year 1933 in which it was received. An additional tax of $56,389.65 was assessed which petitioner paid in October, 1936, with interest. Claim for refund was then filed and on its rejection this suit was brought against the collector.\n On motion of petitioner the District Court entered a summary judgment in his favor (20 F.Supp. 619) which the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 2 Cir., 96 F.2d 141. Because of a conflict with the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit in Magruder v. Segebade, 94 F.2d 177, certiorari was granted, May 31, 1938, \n304 \nU.S. 557\n, 58 S.Ct. 1060\n\n\n The Court of Appeals overruled the contentions of petitioner that the property he received was within the statutory exemption (Section 22(b)(3) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 26 U.S.C.A.  22(b)(3), and, further, that the property was not income either under the statute or under the Sixteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. As the view of the Court of Appeals upon these questions determined the rights of the parties, it was found unnecessary to discuss certain affirmative defenses set up by the answer of the respondent and these defenses are not pressed in this court.\n First.-By section 22(b)(3) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 26 U.S.C.A.  22(b) (3), there is exempted from the income tax-\n'The value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance ...'.\n\n Whether property received by an heir from the estate of his ancestor is acquired by inheritance, when it is distributed under an agreement settling a contest by the heir of the validity of the decedent's will, is a question upon which state courts have differed. The question has arisen in the application of state laws of taxation. In Massachusetts, the rule is that when a will is admitted to probate under a compromise agreement, the state succession tax is applied to the property 'that passes by the terms of the will as written and not as changed by \n\n[305 \nU.S. 188, 192]\n\u00a0\n any agreement for compromise'. Baxter v. Treasurer & Receiver General, 209 Mass. 459, 463, 95 N.E. 854, 856. Although under the Massachusetts statute relating to compromise1 it is the practice to insert a clause in the court's decree that the estate is to be administered in accordance with the agreement, 'yet the rights of the parties so far as they rest upon the agreement are contractual and not testamentary'. Ellis v. Hunt, 228 Mass. 39, 43, 116 N.E. 956. See, also, Brandeis v. Atkins, 204 Mass. 471, 474, 90 N.E. 861, 26 L.R.A.,N.S., 230; Copeland v. Wheelwright, 230 Mass. 131, 136, 119 N.E. 667. Thus, when a contest was withdrawn under a compromise and the residuary estate was divided equally between the legatee and the heirs, it was held that the tax was properly levied upon the entire residuary legacy and that the administrators with the will annexed had no right to pay out of the share transferred to the heirs one-half of the tax thus collectible from the legatee unless the compromise agreement expressly or impliedly so provided. Brown v. McLoughlin, 287 Mass. 15, 17, 190 N.E. 795. Several States have a similar rule. \n2\n In other States the amount received by an heir under an agreement compromising a contest of his ancestor's will is considered to be received by virtue of his heirship and is subject to an inheritance tax unless the statute exempts him. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 188, 193]\n\u00a0\n In the instant case, the Court of Appeals applied the Massachusetts rule, holding that whether the property was received by way of inheritance depended 'upon the law of the jurisdiction under which this taxpayer received it' (page 143). We think that this ruling was erroneous. The question as to the construction of the exemption in the federal statute is not determined by local law. We are not concerned with the peculiarities and special incidences of state taxes or with the policies they reflect. Undoubtedly the state law determines what persons are qualified to inherit property within the jurisdiction. Mager v. Grima, 8 How. 490, 493; Maxwell v. Bugbee, \n250 \nU.S. 525, 536\n, 537 S., 40 S.Ct. 2, 5. The local law determines the right to make a testamentary disposition of such property and the conditions essential to the validity of wills, and the state courts settle their construction. Uterhart v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 598, 603\n, 36 S.Ct. 417, 418. The State establishes the procedure governing the probate of wills and the processes of administration. Petitioner's status as heir was thus determined by the law of Massachusetts. That law also regulated the procedure by which his rights as an heir could be vindicated. The state law authorized its courts to supervise the making of agreements compromising contests by heirs of the validity of an alleged will of their ancestor, in order that such compromises shall be just and reasonable with respect to all persons in interest. \n4\n But when the contestant is an heir and a valid compromise agreement has been made and there is a distribution to the heir from the decedent's estate accordingly, the question whether what the heir has thus received has been 'acquired by inheritance' within the meaning of the federal statute necessarily is a federal question. It is not determined by local characterization. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 188, 194]\n\u00a0\n In dealing with the meaning and application of an act of Congress enacted in the exercise of its plenary power under the Constitution to tax income and to grant exemptions from that tax, it is the will of Congress which controls, and the expression of its will, in the absence of language evidencing a different purpose, should be interpreted 'so as to give a uniform application to a nation-wide scheme of taxation'. Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103, 110\n, 53 S.Ct. 74, 77. Congress establishes its own criteria and the state law may control only when the federal taxing act by express language or necessary implication makes its operation dependent upon state law. Burnet v. Harmel, supra. See Burk-Waggoner Oil Association v. Hopkins, \n269 \nU.S. 110, 111\n, 114 S., 46 S.Ct. 48, 49; Weiss v. Wiener, \n279 \nU.S. 333\n, 49 S.Ct. 337; Morrissey v. Commissioner, \n296 \nU.S. 344, 356\n, 56 S.Ct. 289, 294. Compare Crooks v. Harrelson, \n282 \nU.S. 55, 59\n, 51 S.Ct. 49, 50; Poe v. Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101, 109\n, 110 S., 51 S.Ct. 58; Blair v. Commissioner, \n300 \nU.S. 5, 9\n, 10 S., 57 S.Ct. 330, 331. There is no such expression or necessary implication in this instance. Whether what an heir receives from the estate of his ancestor through the compromise of his contest of his ancestor's will should be regarded as within the exemption from the federal tax should not be decided in one way in the case of an heir in Pennsylvania or Minnesota and in another way in the case of an heir in Massachusetts or New York,5 according to the differing views of the state courts. We think that it was the intention of Congress in establishing this exemption to provide a uniform rule.\n Second.-In exempting from the income tax the value of property acquired by 'bequest, devise, or inheritance', Congress used comprehensive terms embracing all acquisitions in the devolution of a decedent's estate. For the word 'descent', as used in the earlier acts,6 Congress sub- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 188, 195]\n\u00a0\n stituted the word 'inheritance' in the 1926 act and the subsequent revenue acts as 'more appropriately including both real and personal property.' \n7\n Thus the acquisition by succession to a decedent's estate whether real or personal was embraced in the exemption. Further, by the 'estate tax', Congress has imposed a tax upon the transfer of the entire net estate of every person dying after September 8, 1916,8 allowing such exemptions as it sees fit in arriving at the net estate. Congress has not indicated any intention to tax again the value of the property which legatees, devisees or heirs receive from the decedent's estate.\n Petitioner was concededly an heir of his grandmother under the Massachusetts statute. It was by virtue of that heirship that he opposed probate of her alleged will which constituted an obstacle to the enforcement of his right. Save as heir he had no standing. Seeking to remove that obstacle, he asserted that the will was invalid because of want of testamentary capacity and undue influence. In accordance with local practice, he asked the probate court to frame these issues for a jury trial. It then became necessary for him to satisfy the court that the issues were substantial. Issues are not to be framed unless it appears from statements by counsel of expected evidence or otherwise that there is a 'genuine question of fact supported by evidence of such substantial nature as to afford ground for reasonable expectation of a result favorable to the party requesting the framing of issues'. Briggs v. Weston, Mass., 2 N.E.2d 466, 467; Smith v. Patterson, 286 Mass. 356, 190 N.E. 536. Petitioner satisfied that condition and the probate court directed the framing of jury issues. It was in that situation, facing a trial of the issue of the validity of the will, that the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 188, 196]\n\u00a0\n compromise was made by which the heirs, including the petitioner, were to receive certain portions of the decedent's estate.\n There is no question that petitioner obtained that portion, upon the value of which he is sought to be taxed, because of his standing as an heir and of his claim in that capacity. It does not seem to be questioned that if the contest had been fought to a finish and petitioner had succeeded, the property which he would have received would have been exempt under the federal act. Nor is it questioned that if in any appropriate proceeding, instituted by him as heir, he had recovered judgment for a part of the estate, that part would have been acquired by inheritance within the meaning of the act. We think that the distinction sought to be made between acquisition through such a judgment and acquisition by a compromise agreement in lieu of such a judgment is too formal to be sound, as it disregards the substance of the statutory exemption. It does so, because it disregards the heirship which underlay the compromise, the status which commanded that agreement and was recognized by it. While the will was admitted to probate, the decree also required the distribution of the estate in accordance with the compromise and, so far as the latter provided for distribution to the heirs, it overrode the will. So far as the will became effective under the agreement it was because of the heirs' consent and release and in consideration of the distribution they received by reason of their being heirs. Respondent agrees that the word 'inheritance' as used in the federal statute is not solely applicable to cases of complete intestacy. The portion of the decedent's property which petitioner obtained under the compromise did not come to him through the testator's will. That portion he obtained because of his heirship and to that extent he took in spite of the will and as in case of intestacy. The fact that petitioner received less than \n\n[305 \nU.S. 188, 197]\n\u00a0\n the amount of his claim did not alter its nature or the quality of its recognition through the distribution which he did receive.\n We are not convinced by the argument that petitioner had but 'the expectations' of an heir and realized on a 'bargaining position'. He was heir in fact. Whether he would receive any property in that capacity depended upon the validity of his ancestor's will and the extent to which it would dispose of his ancestor's estate. When, by compromise and the decree enforcing it, that disposition was limited, what he got from the estate came to him because he was heir, the compromise serving to remove pro tanto the impediment to his inheritance. We are of the opinion that the exemption applies.\n In this view we find it unnecessary to consider the other questions that have been discussed at the bar.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed. It is so ordered.\n Judgment of Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and judgment of District Court affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Massachusetts General Laws (Ter.Ed.) 1932, Chap. 204, Secs. 13-18. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Matter of Cook's Estate, 187 N.Y. 253, 79 N.E. 991; English v.

UNITED STATES(1938)\nNo. 98\nArgued: Decided: December 5, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 267, 268]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Lawrence Cake, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 267, 271]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 267, 274]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner paid, and in this suit seeks to recover, an amount included in a deficiency assessment made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as additional income tax for the year ending January 31, 1932. The question is whether petitioner is liable under Revenue Act of 1932,  22(a). 1\n The material substance of the findings follows.\n For itself and a subsidiary corporation, petitioner made consolidated return. The commissioner added to the income of the subsidiary on account of improvements made to its property by a lessee. He ruled the improvements were income to lessor in that year to the extent of their value at termination of the lease.\n Lessor purchased the real estate in 1927, and September 13, 1930, leased it for use as a moving picture theater for a term of ten years, beginning upon completion of improvements to be made. At its own cost and expense, lessor agreed to make alterations in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by an architect selected by the parties. Lessee agreed to install the latest type of moving picture and talking apparatus, theater seats and all other fixtures, furniture and equipment necessary for the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 267, 275]\n\u00a0\n successful operation of a modern theater to become the property of lessor at the expiration or sooner termination of the lease.\n Lessor made a contract with the builder to make the contemplated improvements and agreed to pay, up to a specified limit, actual cost, plus builder's profit and architect's fee. Additional work ordered by lessee was to be paid for by it. Lessee consented to the terms of the contract and agreed to pay for work and materials ordered by it. All improvements were completed in January 1931; lessee took possession of the property February 1 of that year.\n The total cost of all improvements was $114,468.77; lessor paid $73, 794.47; lessee paid the balance, $40,674.30. 'The estimated depreciated value at the termination of the lease of the alterations and improvements paid for by the lessee was computed by the commissioner and was agreed to by the plaintiff (petitioner), as follows:\n Depreciated value at end Cost of 10 years (1) Ventilating system $3,959.75 $2,771.83 (2) Glazing, architect's fee and other items 10,366.37 7,256.46 (3) Painting 760.80 0 (4) Other improvements 185.97 0 (5) Chairs 9,167.24 3,055.75 (6) Booth 5,197.39 0 (7) Draperies 7,075.42 2,358.47 (8) Elec. signs and marquee 3,961.36 1,980.63 Total 40,674.30 $17,423.14\n From these figures it appears that the calculations were based on annual depreciation of items (1) and (2) at 3 per cent., on (5) and (7), at 6 2\/3 per cent., on (8), at 5 per cent., and on (3), (4), and (6), at 10 per cent.'\n For the year in question, the commissioner added to income of lessor $ 1,742.31, one-tenth of the cost so de- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 267, 276]\n\u00a0\n preciated. The resulting additional tax was $211.61. Petitioner paid it; the commissioner disallowed claim for refund. The lower court held petitioner not entitled to recover; it sustained the tax on the ground that, immediately upon completion of the improvements made by lessee, they became the property of lessor, and constituted compensation paid by lessee as additional rental for the use of the leased premises.\n Petitioner insists that where improvements are made by lessee, there is no realization of gain at the time the improvements are completed; that the accession of value to the property is not income but a capital addition. The United States says that, while the case presents the question whether depreciated value of improvements by lessee constitutes income to lessor in the taxable year, the 'basic question is whether income is ever realized by the lessor in such cases, and if so, when.' Assuming that improvements made by lessee and which will outlast the term constitute income to lessor at some time, its brief discusses the questions whether the income is realized upon (1) completion of the improvements, (2) termination of the lease, or (3) disposition of the improved property. It concludes that the 'soundest theory seems to be that such income is taxable at the time the improvements are erected.' And, without supporting the lower court's ruling that the estimated depreciated value at the end of the ten-year term constituted additional rent or compensation paid for the use of the premises, it asks that the judgment be upheld.\n We are not called on to decide whether under any lease or in any circumstances, income is received by lessor by reason of improvements made by lessee, nor to choose, for general approval or condemnation, any of the theories expounded by the United States. Concretely, the ques- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 267, 277]\n\u00a0\n tion presented is whether, under the lease here involved, one-tenth of what the commissioner and taxpayer call and agree to be 'estimated depreciated value,' as of the end of the term, was income to petitioner in the first year of the term. And that question is to be decided upon the lower court's special findings unaffected by any statement of fact, reasoning, or conclusion that may be found in its opinion. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n There is nothing in the findings to suggest that cost of any improvement made by lessee was rent or an expenditure not properly to be attributed to its capital or maintenance account as distinguished from operating expense. While the lease required it to make improvements necessary for successful operation, no item was specified, nor the time or amount of any expenditure. The requirement was one making for success of the business to be done on the leased premises. It well may have been deemed by lessor essential or appropriate to secure payment of the rent stipulated in the lease. Even when required, improvements by lessee will not be deemed rent unless intention that they shall be is plainly disclosed. Rent is 'a fixed sum, or property amounting to a fixed sum, to be paid at stated times for the use of property ...; it does not include payments, uncertain both as to amount and time, made for the cost of improvements ....'3 The facts found are clearly not sufficient to sustain the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 267, 278]\n\u00a0\n lower court's holding to the effect that the making of improvements by lessee was payment of rent.\n It remains to be considered whether the amount in question represented taxable income, other than rent, in the first year of the term.\n The findings fail to disclose any basis of value on which to lay an income tax or the time of realization of taxable gain, if any there was. The figures made by the commissioner are not defined. The findings do not show whether they are intended to represent value of improvements if removed or the amount attributable to them as a part of the building.\n The figures themselves repel the suggestion that they were intended to represent amounts obtainable for the items if removed. We are not required to assume that the commissioner intended his estimates to represent salvage, at the end of the term, of ventilating system, glazing, architect's fees and the like, draperies, chairs, electric signs, and marquee, the useful lives of which in place have declined from 30 to 66 2\/3 per cent. It does not appear that if detached from the building they would then have any value, even as junk, over necessary cost of removal. It is clear that, if any value as of that time may be attributed to them, it is included in and not separable from that of the leased premises.\n Equally conjectural would be assumption that the figures represent enhancement of value of the leased premises by reason of the improvements when new or as deteriorated at the end of the term. The leased property is capable of inventory and analysis for the purpose of ascertaining original and estimated present cost of its elements and other relevant facts as indications of worth to be taken into account in determining its value; i. e., the money equivalent to the property as a whole. \n4\n But \n\n[305 \nU.S. 267, 279]\n\u00a0\n present or future value, however ascertained, is single in substance; it cannot be arrived at by mere summation of actual or estimated cost of constituent elements, new or depreciated. \n5\n The addition to value of the leased premises resulting from the lessee's improvements may not be arrived at by formula or arithmetically by merely setting against each item or element its cost less depreciation estimated to accrue during the term of the lease. \n6\n The amount included in the total value of the structure reasonably to be attributed to the improvements after use for ten years is not ascertainable by the simple calculations employed by the commissioner.\n Granting that the improvements increased the value of the building, that enhancement is not realized income of lessor. \n7\n So far as concerns taxable income, the value of the improvements is not distinguishable from excess, if any there may be, of value over cost of improvements made by lessor. Each was an addition to capital; not income within the meaning of the statute. \n8\n Treasury Regulations can add nothing to income as defined by Congress. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 267, 280]\n\u00a0\n But, assuming that at some time value of the improvements would be income of lessor, it cannot be reasonably assigned to the year in which they were installed. The commissioner found that at the end of the term some would be worthless and excluded them. He also excluded depreciation of other items. These exclusions imply that elements which will not outlast lessee's right to use are not at any time income of lessor. The inclusion of the remaining value is to hold that petitioner's right to have them as a part of the building at expiration of lease constitutes income in the first year of the term in an amount equal to their estimated value at the end of the term without any deduction to obtain present worth as of date of installation. It may be assumed that, subject to the lease, lessor became owner of the improvements at the time they were made. But it had no right to use or dispose of them during the term. Mere acquisition of that sort did not amount to contemporaneous realization of gain within the meaning of the statute.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I acquiesce in that part of the Court's opinion which construes the findings below as failing to establish that the lessees' improvements resulted in an increase in market value of the lessor's land in the taxable year. As it is unnecessary to decide whether such increase, if established, would constitute taxable income of the lessor, I do not join in so much of the opinion as, upon an assumption contrary to the findings, undertakes to discuss that question. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Gross income' includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service, of whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever. ...' 47 Stat. 178, 26 U.S.C.A.  22(a).

In February, 1934, Joseph Triner Corporation, an Illinois corporatin engaged there in the manufacture of intoxicating liquors, complied with the Minnesota foreign corporations law; secured from the Liquor Control Commissioner a license to sell such liquors within Minnesota at wholesale; and thereafter carried on in that State the business of selling to retailers liquors manufactured by it in Illinois. The Legislature of Minnesota enacted chapter 390, approved April 29, 1935, which provides:\n'No licensed manufacturer or wholesaler shall import any brand or brands of intoxicating liquors containing more than 25 per cent of alcohol by volume ready for sale without further processing unless such brand or brands shall be duly registered in the patent office of the United States.'\n\n The business of Joseph Triner Corporation in Minnesota included selling many brands of liquors containing more than 25 per cent. of alcohol which had not been registered in the Patent Office; and at the time of the enactment of the statute it had there a stock of such liquors. To enjoin the Liquor Control Commissioner of Minnesota from interfering with the business, it brought this suit in the federal court for that State; alleged that the statute of 1935 violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitu- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 401, 403]\n\u00a0\n tion, U.S.C.A.Const.Amend. 14,  1; alleged danger of irreparable injury; and sought both a preliminary and a permanent injunction. The several state officials charged with the duty of enforcing the statute were joined as defendants.\n The case was heard by three judges under section 266 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  380. The court, holding that it had both federal and equity jurisdiction, granted a preliminary injunction, Joseph Triner Corp. v. Arundel, D.C., 11 F.Supp. 145; and later a permanent injunction, Joseph Triner Corp. v. Mahoney, D.C., 20 F.Supp. 1019. The state officials appealed to this Court. The sole contention of Joseph Triner Corporation is that the statute violated the equal protection clause. The state officials insist that the provision of the statute is a reasonable regulation of the liquor traffic; and also, that since the adoption of the Twenty-First Amendment, the equal protection clause is not applicable to imported intoxicating liquor. As we are of opinion that the latter contention is sound, we shall not discuss whether the statutory provision is a reasonable regulation of the liquor traffic.\n First. The statute clearly discriminates in favor of liquor processed within the State as against liquor completely processed elsewhere. For only that locally processed may be sold regardless of whether the brand has been registered. That, under the amendment, discrimination against imported liquor is permissible although it is not an incident of reasonable regulation of the liquor traffic, was settled by State Board of Equalization v. Young's Market Co., \n299 \nU.S. 59, 62\n, 63 S., 57 S.Ct. 77, 78, 79. There, it was contended that, by reason of the discrimination involved, a statute imposing a $500 license fee for importing beer violated both the commerce clause and the equal protection clause. In sustaining its validity we said:\n'The words used (in the Amendment) are apt to confer upon the state the power to forbid all importations which do not comply with the conditions which it (the state) prescribes. ... \n\n[304 \nU.S. 401, 404]\n\u00a0\n 'The plaintiffs argue the limitation of the broad language of the Twenty-First Amendment is sanctioned by its history; and by the decisions of this Court on the Wilson Act (27 U.S.C.A.  121) the Webb-Kenyon Act ( 27 U.S.C.A.  122) and the Reed Amendment (27 U.S.C.A.  1 note). As we think the language of the amendment is clear, we do not discuss these matters. ...\n\n'The claim that the statutory provisions and the regulations are void under the equal protection clause may be briefly disposed of. A classification recognized by the Twenty-First Amendment cannot be deemed forbidden by the Fourteenth.'\n\n Second. Joseph Triner Corporation insists that the statute is unconstitutional because it permits unreasonable discrimination between imported brands. That is, the registered brands of other foreign manufacturers may be imported while its unregistered brands may not be, although 'identical in kind, ingredient and quality.' We are asked to limit the power conferred by the amendment so that only those importations may be forbidden which, in the opinion of the Court, violate a reasonable regulation of the liquor traffic. To do so would, as stated in the Young's Market Case, page 6i, 57 S.Ct. page 78, 'involve not a construction of the amendment, but a rewriting of it.'\n Third. The fact that Joseph Triner Corporation had, when the statute was passed, a valid license and a stock of liquors in Minnesota imported under it, is immaterial. Independently of the Twenty-First Amendment, the State had power to terminate the license. Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623\n, 8 S.Ct. 273; Premier-Pabst Sales Co. v. Grosscup, \n298 \nU.S. 226, 228\n, 56 S.Ct. 754, 755\n\n\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice REED concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMATY v. GRASSELLI CHEMICAL CO.(1938)\nNo. 378\nArgued: February 3, 1938Decided: February 14, 1938\n\n\n\n Messrs. Thomas F. Gain and Charles L. Guerin, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. Louis Rudner, of Trenton, N.J., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner (plaintiff) filed a complaint alleging that he was injured while employed in the silicate department of respondent's (defendant's) chemical plant. Later, and more than two years after the date of his injuries, he amended his complaint. The only effect of the amend- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 197, 198]\n\u00a0\n ment was to broaden the description of the place of employment where the injuries were sustained so as to include the phosphate department located in the same plant but in a different building 500 feet removed from the silicate department.\n The sole question is: Did the New Jersey statute of limitations of two years bar the amendment because it set out a new cause of action?\n The cause, originally brought in the New Jersey state court, was removed, because of diversity of citizenship, to the District Court of New Jersey, where a verdict for plaintiff was set aside and judgment entered for defendant. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the amendment to the complaint set out a new cause of action and was barred by the New Jersey statute of limitations. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The pertinent part of the New Jersey statute of limitations reads:2 'All actions hereafter accruing for injuries to persons caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default of any ... corporation or corporations within this state, shall be commenced and instituted within two years next after the cause of such action shall have accrued and not after.'\n The original complaint alleged:\n'1. The plaintiff was in the employ of the defendant in the month of November, 1933, and for some time prior thereto at defendant's plant in Grasselli, County of Union and State of New Jersey.\n\n'2. The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as furnace man, operator and general worker in the Silicate Department of defendant's plant.' \n\n[303 \nU.S. 197, 199]\n\u00a0\n The complaint further alleged that plaintiff was injured while so employed by inhaling gases or injurious substances proximately caused by respondent's failure to protect plaintiff from unnecessary dangers and to provide plaintiff a reasonably safe place in which to work.\n\n The amendment-added more than two years after the injuries were sustained-caused paragraph 2 of the complaint to read as follows: '2. The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as furnace man, operator and general worker in the Silicate Department of defendant's plant and was also employed in other Departments of the defendant's plant where he performed his duties as he was directed to do during his employment in the Phosphate Department and Dorr department.' (New matter represented by italics.)\n This amendment did not change plaintiff's cause of action. The original action was brought for injuries sustained by inhaling harmful substances while the plaintiff was in the defendant's employ previous to and including November, 1933. The essentials of this cause of action were employment; injury by or from harmful gases or substances while engaged in the employment; and proof that the injuries resulted from the negligent failure of defendant to protect plaintiff from unnecessary dangers and to provide plaintiff with a reasonably safe place in which to work. The responsibility of respondent was the same whether the harmful gases or substances were inhaled in the silicate department, the phosphate department, the dorr department, or any other department where plaintiff was performing his duties under his employment. It is not reasonably possible to say that petitioner's right of recovery under the original complaint and under the amended complaint were two separate and distinct causes of action.\n Petitioner can have only one recovery for the one single injury alleged as a result of a breach of one continuing duty under one continuous employment. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 197, 200]\n\u00a0\n The New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals very clearly declared that state's rule applying to the operation of its statute of limitations, in 1935, as follows: 'Amendments in causes where the statute of limitations has run, ... will not as a rule be held to state a new cause of action if the facts alleged show substantially the same wrong with respect to the same transaction, or if it is the same matter more fully or differently laid, or if the gist of the action or the subject of the controversy remains the same; and this is true although ... the alleged incidents of the transaction may be different. Technical rules will not be applied in determining whether the cause of action stated in the original and amended pleadings are identical, since in the strict sense almost any amendment may be said to change the original cause of action.' \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n Under this rule laid down by the New Jersey Court, as to New Jersey's statute of limitations, the amended complaint here substantially alleged the same wrong as the original complaint; relied upon the identical matter more fully and differently laid; and the essential elements of the action and the controversy remained the same between the parties after as before the amendment.\n Pleadings are intended to serve as a means of arriving at fair and just settlements of controversies between litigants. They should not raise barriers which prevent the achievement of that end. The original complaint in this cause and the amended complaint were not based upon different causes of action. They referred to the same kind of employment, the same general place of employ- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 197, 201]\n\u00a0\n ment, the same injury and the same negligence. Proper pleading is important, but its importance consists in its effectiveness as a means to accomplish the end of a just judgment. The effect of the amendment here was to facilitate a fair trial of the existing issues between plaintiff and defendant. The New Jersey statute of limitations did not bar the amended cause of action. The court below was in error. Since the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was based only on a consideration and improper application of the statute of limitations, the cause is reversed and remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings in harmony with these views.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 3 Cir., 89 F.2d 456, certiorari granted \n302 \nU.S. 663\n, 58 S.Ct. 51, 82 L.Ed. --.

INDIANAPOLIS WATER CO.(1938)\nNo. 90\nArgued: December 15, 1937Decided: January 3, 1938\n\n\n\n Mr. Urban C. Stover, Dep. Atty. Gen., for petitioners.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n This suit was originally brought by the Indianapolis Water Company to restrain the enforcement of an order of the Public Service Commission of Indiana fixing a temporary schedule of rates pending the Commission's investigation. The District Court of three judges, 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S. C.A.  380, denied an interlocutory injunction, and the temporary rates became effective. The Commission on \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 420]\n\u00a0\n December 30, 1932, adopted a different and permanent schedule of rates to be effective January 1, 1933. The Company then filed an amended and supplemental bill assailing those rates as confiscatory and invoking the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. An interlocutory injunction was not sought and the case was properly heard in the District Court by a single judge. Indianapolis Water Company v. McCart, 13 F.Supp. 107; Smith v. Wilson, \n273 \nU.S. 388\n, 47 S.Ct. 385; Stratton v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 10\n, 51 S.Ct. 8; Healy v. Ratta, \n289 \nU.S. 701\n, 53 S.Ct. 522. Pursuant to the Commission's final order, the Company filed the schedule of rates as prescribed, and these rates went into effect on January 1, 1933, and under that order have since been in effect without limitation of time.\n The Commission found that the fair value of the Company's property as of November 1, 1932, was not less than $22,500,000 and that the income under the new rates would be 'approximately $1,400,000, or a return slightly in excess of six per cent' on that amount. The District Court appointed a special master, who received evidence between May 1, 1933, and August 10, 1933, and held a further and reopened session on October 18, 1933, when the hearing of evidence was closed. On April 18, 1934, the master offered to receive evidence as to the actual operations of the Company for 1933, but the respective parties informed the master that they did not desire to offer any such testimony. The master filed his report on May 18, 1934. The appraisals before the master were made as of April 1, 1933. He found the fair value of the Company's property to be $20,282,143 as of that date and also as of the time of filing his report. He estimated and found that the income applicable to return for the year 1933 and for a reasonable time thereafter would be $1,294,566.51. He concluded that the rates were not confiscatory. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 421]\n\u00a0\n After a hearing upon exceptions to the master's report, the District Court entered a final decree on November 29, 1935, dismissing the amended and supplemental bill of complaint. 13 F.Supp. 110. The court found that the value of the Company's property was $21,392,821 as of April 1, 1933, and, although the evidence of value had been addressed to that date, the court went further and found in its decree that this amount 'was the fair and reasonable value thereof as of the time of filing the report of the Special Master herein and as of the date of these findings and that such value will continue to be a fair and reasonable value of the plaintiff's used and useful property for a reasonable time in the future.' The court adopted the finding of the master that the income would be not less than $ 1,294,566.51 for the year 1933 and for a reasonable time thereafter.\n Upon appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals, reviewing the evidence upon disputed points, found that there should be certain increases, amounting to $975,437, in the rate base, making it $22,368,258. The court observed that from April 1, 1933, the valuation date, to the date of the decree of the District Court, November, 29, 1935, thirty-two months had intervened; that this period was no longer one for prophecy but had passed 'from the field of speculation to one of experience'; and that experience had shown that in that period there had been 'a constant and definite trend upward in commodity values.' 7 Cir., 89 F.2d 522, 525, 526. With respect to income, the court said that the amount found by the master for 1933 ($1,294,566.51) was about $57,000 higher than that indicated by the testimony of any witness, but the finding was not overruled in view of the failure of the Company to take advantage of its opportunity to show the actual receipts and disbursements for that calendar year. 7 Cir., 89 F.2d 522, at pages 527, 528. Holding that the District Court \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 422]\n\u00a0\n had erred in determining in its decree that the valuations as of April 1, 1933, were applicable to the date of the decree in November, 1935, without taking appropriate account of changed conditions in the interval, the court reversed the decree and remanded the cause for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed in its opinion. 7 Cir., 89 F.2d 522, at page 528.\n Petitioners urge that the Circuit Court of Appeals has virtually required the District Court to find confiscation. We do not think that this is the necessary import of the opinion. The appellate court took judicial notice of an upward trend in prices but did not attempt to make a specific application of that trend. The reversal of the decree requires a hearing anew in the District Court, and upon that hearing all questions pertinent to the issue of confiscation should be open. The economic changes to which the Circuit Court of Appeals has referred may affect income as well as values.\n In the instant case, we do not have a situation in which rates as fixed by a Commission have been enjoined. Here the rates prescribed by the Commission's order have been in effect all through this litigation, and are now in effect. A decree for injunction could operate only as to the future. Another special circumstance is that the decree of the District Court expressly provided that the value it found was the value as of the date of the decree, November 29, 1935, although the evidence before the court related to April 1, 1933. A decree speaking as of the later date and operating thereafter should have a basis in evidence. On the hearing required by the Circuit Court of Appeals, the District Court will be able to ascertain what have been the actual results of the Company's business during the intervening years and thus to base its decree upon known conditions as to those years which may show clearly, in the light of the economic changes which have occurred, whether the prescribed rates are or \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 423]\n\u00a0\n are not of a confiscatory character and whether an injunction restraining the enforcement of the rates should be granted or denied.\n To leave no question as to the authority of the District Court thus fully to rehear and determine the cause, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is modified so as to provide that the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with the views expressed in this opinion. As thus modified, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed. It is so ordered.\n Modified and affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n I cannot agree that this cause brought here by the Public Service Commission and the Attorney General of the State of Indiana should be sent back to the District Court for a new trial. After an examination of the record, I am persuaded that the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals was wrong and that its judgment should not be affirmed either as rendered or in any modified form. The importance of the questions here involved leads me to set out some of my reasons for this belief.\n Six years ago (1931) the City of Indianapolis filed a petition with the Public Service Commission of Indiana against the Indianapolis Water Company, seeking a reduction of water rates for small consumers. The Commission fixed the rates in December, 1932. A master appointed by the District Court reported that there was no confiscation May 18, 1934. The District Court held there was no confiscation November, 1935. The Circuit Court of Appeals found there was confiscation March, 1937. Now, January, 1938, this Court sends the case back to the District Court for trial 'anew.' The cause goes back to the District Court with the admonition from the Circuit Court of Appeals \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 424]\n\u00a0\n that a 'general and persistent rise in prices should have been given effect in fixing a fair valuation.' Affirmance of the Circuit Court of Appeals' decree necessarily approves this statement and this statement requires an increased valuation of the Company's property. Experience demonstrates that rate cases continue to come to this Court until final decisions are reached. If the second trial follows the course of the first, the case should return to this Court by 1943. However, it will now be the duty of the District Court, in trying the case anew, to make a forecast as to probable commodity values covering this future period up to 1943.1 If its forecast should be wrong, the present case will be a precedent for reversing the cause in 1943 for still another trial. Sending the case back indicates that the Circuit Court of Appeals was right in reversing the District Court.\n I believe the Circuit Court of Appeals was in error, that the evidence did not show confiscation, and I cannot agree to the action of the majority. This Court has announced the doctrine that the States have full and complete rights to regulate the rates of local intrastate utilities and that the federal courts cannot and will not interfere with this regulation unless the rates are confiscatory. Furthermore, 'upon that question (of confiscation) the complainant has the burden of proof, and the court may not interfere with the exercise of the state's authority unless confiscation is clearly established.' 2 The judicial function does not extend beyond the decision of the constitutional question. Unless, therefore, the Water Company satisfactorily overcame the presumption that the rate set by the Commission is not confiscatory, this Court should not invade the constitutional sphere of state rate regulation. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 425]\n\u00a0\n I cannot say that the evidence in the District Court 'compelled a conviction that the rate would prove inadequate';4 or that the rates were 'palpably and grossly unreasonable';5 nor was the evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption that the rates, as fixed by the Commission and reinforced by the judgment of the master and the District Court, were not confiscatory. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The master reported the value of the Company's property to be $20,282, 143 as of April 1, 1933. December, 1935, the District Court, after a review of the evidence and the report of the master, refused to enjoin the enforcement of the rates fixed by the Commission. That court excluded from consideration for rate-making purposes a group of farms owned by the Company and estimated by the master to have a value of $264,050, but increased the master's estimate of the value of 'water rights' to $500,000. Evidence having been given of the 'reproduction value' of the Company's property, the District Court increased by $1,333,333 the master's 'estimate' of the 'estimated cost' of labor necessary to 'reproduce' the Company's property; it raised the master's total 'estimate' of this wholly imaginary reproduction from $20,282,143 to $21,392,821.\n March 23, 1937, six years after the City of Indianapolis had originally initiated its efforts to obtain a reduction in water rates, the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded this cause. In doing so, it ordered that the Company's Indiana farms be included in the total valuation upon which the people of Indianapolis must pay the Company an income; added $361,308 to the 'estimate' of the master and District Court for 'undistributed construction costs'; and raised 'going value' $250,079. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 426]\n\u00a0\n The principal reason given for the reversal, however, was that general price levels had arisen, during the thirty-two months intervening between the date at which valuations were fixed (April 1, 1933) to the date of the District Court's decree (November 29, 1935). Looking at price index figures, the Circuit Court of Appeals decided that prices had ascended about 25 per cent. during that period, and that, if the District Court had given proper consideration to this increase in determining the value of the Company's property, that court would have found that the rate fixed by the commission was 'clearly confiscatory.'\n One month and three days, however, after the price index method had been used by the Circuit Court of Appeals in finding the Indianapolis water rates confiscatory, this Court, in the case of Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, \n301 \nU.S. 292\n, 57 S.Ct. 724, struck down a reduced telephone rate fixed by the Ohio Public Service Commission. The people of Ohio were deprived of the benefit of a reduced telephone rate because the decision of the Public Service Commission rested upon price indices. Yet, if the District Court follows the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals which is here affirmed, the people of Indianapolis will be deprived of a reduced water rate because a price index, not introduced in evidence, indicated to the Circuit Court of Appeals that the valuation fixed by the District Court was wrong. This opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals as to value is not repudiated by the affirmance. The majority does not reverse the Circuit Court of Appeals' finding of confiscation.\n I cannot agree that the District Court should be reversed for failure to prophesy the exact future course of commodity prices. The legal knowledge of few judges is such that they can accurately foresee and forecast all price fluctuations. In the delays incident to rate litigation it is probably true that prices will fluctuate many \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 427]\n\u00a0\n times between the beginning of a litigation and the time when the cause is won, lost, or abandoned.\n It has now been more than five years since the Commission fixed a valuation for this waterworks property and it has been more than four years since the master reached his conclusion. If it requires four more years for this case to return to the Circuit Court of Appeals, there can be no doubt but that some price index can be found to show other changes in prices. Such a result will add still further to the confusion and chaos of judicial rate making. I believe it forecasts a day when the present long delays in rate regulation will be endless.\n The City of Indianapolis should not be subjected to another trial unless this Court believes the rates to be confiscatory. When the District Court tries the case anew it will be constrained to follow the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals that a 'general and persistent rise in prices should have been given effect in fixing a fair valuation.' In the meantime, can a judge be found who can accurately divine all future prices of commodities to be used for imaginary reproductions of this Company's property?\n I believe this cause should be brought to a conclusion at this time. \n7\n My belief that the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed is strengthened by a study of the record in the case of McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., \n272 \nU.S. 400\n, 47 S.Ct. 144, of which record we take judicial notice. \n 8\n\u00a0\n\n For the first hundred years of this Nation's history, federal courts did not interfere with state legislation fixing maximum rates for public services performed within the respective states. The state legislatures, according to a custom which this Court declared had existed 'from time immemorial,'9 decided what those maximum rates should \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 428]\n\u00a0\n be. This Court also said that 'for protection against abuses by legislatures the people must resort to the polls, not to the courts.' \n10\n It was not until 1890 that a divided court finally repudiated its earlier constitutional interpretation and declared that due process of law requires judicial invalidation of legislative rates which the courts believe confiscatory. \n11\n The dissenting Justices adhered to the long existing principle that regulation of public utilities was a 'legislative prerogative, and not a judicial one.' \n12\n\u00a0\n\n From this decision in 1890, supra, has come the doctrine that the federal courts have jurisdiction to determine whether a rate fixed by a state for a purely local utility is confiscatory. This doctrine does not purport to give to federal courts more than the limited jurisdiction to determine whether a given state rate is so low as to be confiscatory.\n The determination by the Circuit Court of Appeals that the rates in the present case are confiscatory can only be supported, if at all, by giving underserved weight to evidence given to support the 'reproduction cost' theory. The experience of the people of Indianapolis in their efforts to obtain fair and reasonable water rates from this company which has long had a monopoly in their community discloses what appears to me to be the complete unreliability of the 'reproduction cost' theory. Wherever the question of utility valuation arises today, it is exceedingly difficult to discern the truth through the maze of formulas and the jungle of metaphysical concepts sometimes conceived, and often fostered, by the ingenuity of those who seek inflated valuations to support excessive rates. Even the testimony of engineers, with wide \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 429]\n\u00a0\n experience in developing this theory and expounding it to courts, is not in agreement as to the meaning of the vague and uncertain terms created to add invisible and intangible values to actual physical property. Completely lost in the confusion of language-too frequently invented for the purpose of confusing-commissions and courts passing upon rates for public utilities are driven to listen to conjectures, speculations, estimates, and guesses, all under the name of 'reproduction costs.' In the testimony of professional witnsses employed by the litigants, courts listen to guesses about 'going value'; 'undistributed construction costs'; 'water rights.' \n13\n This Court has even said, 'Reproduction value, however, is not a matter of outlay, but of estimate, and ... proof of actual expenditures originally made, while it would be helpful, is not indispensable.' \n14\n Courts have gone further and further away from considering cost in determining the value of utility property. The cost of this Company's property apparently was given little weight \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 430]\n\u00a0\n in previous litigation which came to this Court. \n15\n This Company's property was valued by this Court at $19,000,000 in the prior litigation, although the Commission's valuation was $16,495,000. It is interesting to note what this property valued at $19,000,000 actually cost.\n The record in the McCardle Case, supra, showed that the property was bought at a judicial sale in 1881 by the present Company at a cost of not more than $535,000, the purchase being financed by a sale of bonds; that apparently no cash was paid for the $500,000 face value of stock issued at that time; that the maximum book value of the Company's assets on December 31, 1923, was $9,195,908, but a witness called by the Commission testified that the Company's records disclosed the actual book value of the property used for the public convenience to be only $7,967,649; that from 1881 to December 31, 1923, stockholder's average annual net profits were $189,255; that practically all of the added book value was the result of additional investments financed by borrowing and not by investment by stockholders; that no other investment was made by the stockholders in the Company since 1881, but in 1909 a write-up of $5,556,071.85 was made on the books by virtue of which a common stock dividend of $4,500,000 was declared in 1910, making the total common stock $5,000,000; that the $5,000,000 stock was thereafter carried on the books of the Company; that the stockholders not only paid no additional money for stock, but that the profits made by the Company between 1881 and 1932 were not reinvested in the Company but were substantially all drawn out in dividends. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 431]\n\u00a0\n This Court found in the McCardle Case that the Company was entitled to a rate based on a $19,000,000, valuation as of December 31, 1923, although the record indicates that the total actual investment made by the Company up to that time was less than $9,000,000 and was not stockholders' investment but was substantially all borrowed money; that the stockholders apparently had made no investment unless (which is very doubtful from the record) they paid for the $500,000 stock in 1881; and that the stockholders had received the following percentage of return on common stock on a $500,000 valuation for the five years preceding this $19,000, 000 appraisal:\n 1919 69% 1920 75% 1921 88% 1922 96% 1923 96%\n\n While it is difficult to find in the present record what additional investments have been made since the $19,000,000 appraisal, it does appear that the Commission found \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 432]\n\u00a0\n that the books of the Company showed an additional investment of $6,661, 292. If this is added to the 1923 book value, it would appear that there is a possibility that, when the appraisal in this cause was made, there may have been between $13,000,000 and $16,000,000 invested through the Company's borrowing activities. But the indebtedness kept pace with the ivnestments and was $13,746,900 at this time. The District Court is now reversed, however, because the Circuit Court of Appeals found that rates based on an obviously inflated value of $21,392,821 fixed by the District Court would confiscate the property of the Company's stockholders.\n There is a marked disparity between the actual cost of this Company's property and its imaginary 'reproduction value.' I shall comment upon a few of many reasons for this disparity.\n First, the so-called 'waster rights'-The Company takes the position that water rights should have been valued at about $2,000,000. Expert witnesses for the City valued these right from nothing to $75,000, and expert witnesses for the Company at $1,000,000 or more. This illustration is typical of the wide variations in expert evidence on 'reproduction cost'; it is a typical 'estimate.' The Company claims that the element of greatest value in the water rights is the 'diversion right.' This 'diversion right' is based, in part, on the theory that for a long number of years the Company has diverted water from the White river. According to one theory, it is claimed water which would otherwise flow down stream is diverted by the Company; that the Tom Taggart Park in Indianapolis might possibly be injured by this diversion (but the City has not complained); that the stream offers possibilities of scenic beauty if there were adequate water and if it should be made suitable for navigation by small pleasure crafts. It does not appear that this formula evolved as a result of any one's \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 433]\n\u00a0\n expressed or frustrated desire to sail this stream. From the possibility, however, that the stream could be used for this purpose if imaginary people should so desire, an imaginary damage to these imaginary sailors is discovered. Based upon this potential menace to these imaginary people and their imaginary desire to use this stream, an imaginary value of $200,000 is suggested as the cost which the Company might incur in discharging its imaginary duty to improve the stream for these imaginary sailors.\n It is difficult to believe that such concepts of property can establish clear proof that the Constitution of the United States has been violated. Nor do I believe that, even if the people of Indianapolis and the surrounding community have permitted the Water Company to use this stream for a public service, there has been a grant of a prescriptive property right which can be capitalized by the Company, in order to exact higher water rates from the very people who granted the privilege.\n If the Company had made actual investments in its property between 1933 and 1935, resort to illusory property concepts would not be necessary. Clearly, it would be entitled to a reasonable return upon such actual investment. Such is not the case. The order for a new trial is not based on a claim that the Company has invested even one additional dollar. It is not claimed that the Company bought additional land; added an inch to any of its dams; extended its distribution pipes; improved its filtration system; or purchased one additional piece of property.\n This Court has frequently declared that, in reaching a conclusion as to a reasonable rate, the public must be considered as well as the stockholders and bondholders. \n17\n The doctrine against confiscatory rates is based upon \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 434]\n\u00a0\n the theory of protecting the right of bondholders to their interest and that of stockholders to a fair return upon the value of their actual investments. While this matter has been confused by the 'reproduction cost' theory, the fact remains that, as applied to corporations, it is the interest of the stockholders and bondholders which the due process clause protects.\n The evidence in this case clearly establishes that the bondholders have neverbeen, and are not now, in any jeopardy as to their interest payments. In the margin appears the record of stockholders' dividends since the $19,000,000 valuation. \n18\n In view of these dividends on this stock of uncertain cost, these stockholders were in no imminent peril because of the District Court's valuation of more than $21,000,000.\n[]\n Rate paid on inflated Rate paid Year Amount $5,000,000 on possible stock $500,000 valuation valuation []\n 1924 500,000.00 10% 100% 1925 1926 600,000.00 12% 120% 1927 950,000.00 19% 190% 1928 1,000,000.00 20% 200% 1929 650,000.00 13% 130% 1930 1,225,000.00 24 1\/2% 245% 1931 600,000.00 12% 120% 1932 375,000.00 7 1\/2% 75% []\n'surely, before the courts are called upon to adjudge an act of the legislature fixing the maximum passenger rates for railroad companies to be unconstitutional, on the ground that its enforcement would prevent the stockholders from receiving any dividends on their investments, or the bondholders any interest on their loans, they should be fully advised as to what is done with the receipts and earnings of the company; for, if so advised, it might clearly appear that a prudent and honest management would, within the rates prescribed, secure to the bondholders their interest, and to the stockholders reasonable dividends.'

Wellman, supra, \n143 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 12 S.Ct. 400, 402. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 435]\n\u00a0\n This case is an illustration of the almost insuperable obstables to rate regulation today. It involves a single Company supplying water to a single community. It does not present the difficulties of a far-flung utility system covering much territory with many separate corporate creatures. Nevertheless, this particular case has already consumed more than six years and is apparently destined to remain suspended for six more years. \n19\n More than 2,000 pages of records and exhibits appear in this Court in the appeal.\n\n This case was first heard by the Public Service Commission. Evidence and arguments were there introduced and the questions of value, rates, etc ., were fully explored. Thereafter the Commission which had been specially created by the State of Indiana to investigate such cases rendered its decree.\n Next, the case was investigated by a master in the District Court. This Court has admonished the lower court\n[]\n Bill Filed Decided Time [] United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Comm., \n278 \nU.S. 300\n, 49 S.Ct. 150 Dec. 1923 Jan. 1929 5 years United Fuel Gas Co. v.

By 1931 the Commission announced its tentative order. 1934 the Commission made what purports to be a final valuation. April, 1937, this Court returned the cause for further action. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 436]\n\u00a0\n that a master should be appointed for such purposes. \n20\n Extensive hearings before the master produced voluminous testimony at tremendous expense to the litigants. While this expense may appear on the books of the Company, it will ultimately be borne by the consumers.\n After the master heard the evidence, it went to the District Court for a third review. Thereafter it appeared in the Circuit Court of Appeals where it was again reviewed. Since it has come to this Court, I believe that the ends of justice require that it be concluded. History indicates that, if it is not concluded, this is not likely to be the last journey made by the cause from Indianapolis to Washington. Litigation costs in rate regulation today constitute a heavy burden.\n In the main, the dispute in this case, as in most rate cases, revolves around 'intangibles' and 'reproduction costs.'\n'Intangibles,' as expounded by hired experts in rate litigations, might well be defined as 'properties' that can neither be seen nor touched and which can rarely be understood. They can have little meaning when applied to property which is not for sale but for use. These property concepts are so uncertain, tenuous, and elusive that no two witnesses give them the same value except on occasions when several witnesses have been employed by the same litigant.21\n\n Witnesses in the present case varied as to 'organization' costs from $ 81,000 to $325,000. Experts differed as to 'going value' between $1,000, 000 and $2,700,000 and on water rights from nothing to $2,000,000. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 437]\n\u00a0\n Such differences are not exceptional. They occur in most cases that have reached this Court which involve expert appraisal of such phantom concepts of property.\n The estimates made by witnesses of 'reproduction costs' of pipes for this waterworks system strikingly illustrate this method of valuation. A Company expert estimated that the reproduction cost of the Company's 'main' pipes, as of 1923, was $7,024,289. In this guess it was assumed that the pipe had a life of 125 years and that, 'as a matter of fact, it does not wear out in use.' If these pipes last 125 years, the reproduction cost theory will subject the water consumers of Indianapolis to innumerable increases in the price of water during the next century. Experts can undoubtedly be found who will testify from time to time during the coming century that the hypothetical digging up of old pipes and the hypothetical laying of hypothetical new pipes will constantly increase the hypothetical reproduction value of pipes. In fact, the actual pipes will not be dug up. They will continue to lie untouched and at rest-under the soil.\n Under this reproduction cost theory, the constitutional water rate in Indianapolis must fluctuate during the next century with the price of cast- iron pipes. One of the principal elements of the so-called 'reproduction value' in this case is this very pipe. I do not believe that the constitutionality of action by a sovereign State of this Union is dependent upon the market fluctuations of cast iron pipe.\n Testimony was given in this case as to the 'reproduction cost' of a canal used by the Water Company. The State of Indiana constructed this canal for navigation purposes a hundred years ago. Some years after its completion, it was obtained by the Water Works Company of Indianapolis and, while the record is not clear, the price might have been as great as $35, 000. When the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 438]\n\u00a0\n reorganization of the company occurred in 1881, this canal was placed upon the books of the present company at $50,000. It remained on the books at this figure until the write-up in 1909 which preceded the $4,500,000 stock dividend. At that time, it was hoisted to $1,773,874. By 1911, this same canal apparently was carried at $2,746.538. In the rate valuation case in 1923, experts of the company valued it at more than $3,000,000. Extensive testimony has been given in this and the McCardle Case, supra, concerning the 'reproduction value' of this canal. The expert who was 'reproducing' the canal in 1923 'assumed a similar set of conditions to those existing at the time the canal was originally constructed.' In other words, the witness took himself and his staff back a hundred years to the conditions that existed in Indiana at the time and place of the construction of this State navigation canal. Thus projecting himself back into history, he found that the water consumers of Indianapolis should pay to the present owners of the canal 6 per cent. income on more than $3,000,000. I cannot subscribe to the belief that it would violate the Constitution of the United States for the State of Indiana to deny the company 6 per cent. income on a still higher valuation of a canal that never at the outside cost the Company more than $50,000. The question in the federal courts in connection with rates is not what would be a reasonable rate to be charged by such a company, but it is limited wholly and exclusively to a decision as to whether or not a rate will confiscate the property of the company. The evidence in this case is not so 'compelling' as to justify a reversal of the District Court's valuation, which valuation, itself, necessarily contains a finding of value far in excess of what this canal cost or what it is reasonably worth. In a dissenting opinion by certain commissioners of the Public Service Commission of Indiana in the McCardle Case, they said: \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 439]\n\u00a0\n 'Would any reasonable man entertain the proposition of duplicating the canal, if a new water-works system were to be constructed in Indianapolis? Certainly not.\n'In the estimated reconstruction new cost there is the highly fancied estimate of the cost of duplicating the canal as it was constructed ninety years ago. It would be just as germane to the ascertainment of the actual value of the petitioner's property used and useful in the present water service of Indianapolis to indulge in a magnified imagination of the expense of repopulating the canal banks with the Indians.'\n\n The State of Indiana did not appeal from the judgment of the District Court. We, therefore, are not called upon to decide whether the rates now in force are so extortionate as to confiscate the property of the consumers. The Company appealed from the District Court seeking a higher valuation. The Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the Company was entitled to a higher valuation.\n As a reason for reversing and remanding this cause, the majority opinion points to the fact that no interlocutory injunction has been issued. I believe that the fact that no injunction was issued after the Public Service Commission of Indiana, the master in the federal court, and the District Court had all found that the rates were not confiscatory, is but an added reason why this Court should not agree to overturn that finding and should reverse the cause. It will be wholly impossible in my judgment for any trial court to try this cause again free from the plain implication, in the action of this Court, that the value of the Company's property should be found to be approximately 25 per cent. greater than $22, 000,000. How can any trial court ignore the fact that the Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated a strong belief that the value should be raised 25 per cent.? How can any trial court escape the conclusion that an injunction should now be issued to prevent the enforcement of the rates that have been in effect? \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 440]\n\u00a0\n There is nothing strange or unusual about the decree of the District Court fixing a value as of November 23, 1935, as well as of April 1, 1933. Any other action by the court would have gone directly in the teeth of the plain mandates of this Court in other cases. Not only was the District Court compelled to attempt to find the value as of 1933 and as of 1935, but under the opinions of this Court it was necessary that it attempt to lift the veil of the future, peer into its mysteries, and determine the value of the Company's property for a reasonable time after 1935. Its action was dictated by the command of this Court that 'an honest and intelligent forecast of probable future vlaues, made upon a view of all the relevant circumstances, is essential.' State of Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 276, 288\n, 43 S.Ct. 544, 546, 31 A.L.R. 807. If this language was not sufficient as an imperative admonition for the judge to become a prophet, there was the statement made by this Court in connection with the appraisal of this particular Company's property in McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., \n272 \nU.S. 400, 408\n, 409 S., 47 S.Ct. 144, 148, that: 'It must be determined whether the rates complained of are yielding and will yield ... a reasonable rate of return on the value of the property at the time of the investigation and for a reasonable time in the immediate future.' Surely it is not a ground for reversing the cause now that the District Court has followed these instructions. Is the majority overruling these cases? Must the District Court, when the case is tried 'anew,' obey the former mandates 'to prophesy' or does the opinion of the majority mean it should not prophesy? If the trial court does prophesy, and human fallibility brings error into the prophecy, will this Court again six years hence reverse and remand for another trial 'anew'? I believe this affirmance adds additional uncertainty to the existing chaos of rules and formulas created by judicial pronouncement in the field of rate \n\n[302 \nU.S. 419, 441]\n\u00a0\n litigation. I further believe it to be wrong to send this case back for another trial, because I believe the record affirmatively shows that the consumers of water in Indianapolis are already compelled to pay an unjustifiable price for their water on account of previous judicial overvaluation of this property.\n I believe the State of Indiana has the right to regulate the price of water in Indianapolis free from interference by federal courts. The courts did not deny this right to the states for the first hundred years after the adoption of the Constitution. \n22\n But, even under the comparatively recent doctrine purporting to give federal courts jurisdiction to invalidate rates fixed by a state, I am of the opinion that the federal courts have no jurisdiction to proceed in this cause. I base this belief on the record which does not show clearly that the stockholders of the Indianapolis Water Company hve ever made any substantial investment which could be confiscated. I further believe that the evidence does not clearly establish that the rates fixed by the Commission will fail to provide an income amply adequate to pay all interest on the Company's funded debt and provide far more than a 6 per cent. profit on any actual value in excess of the borrowed capital remaining unpaid. I, therefore, believe that this Court should order this cause dismissed for want of jurisdiction or that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed and the opinion of the District Court dismissing the Company's bill should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] McCardle v.

Meacham, of Chattanooga, Tenn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Section 5197, Revised Statutes, as amended,1 governs the rates of interest to be taken by national banking associations and \n\n[303 \nU.S. 245, 246]\n\u00a0\n section 51982 declares that the receiving of a rate of interest greater than that allowed, when knowingly done, shall be deemed a forfeiture of the entire interest and provides that, in case a greater rate has been paid, the person paying it may recover back twice the amount, in a suit in the nature of an action of debt. Petitioner is trustee in bankruptcy of Lookout Planing Mills, a corporation. He brought this suit under section 5198 in the chancery court of Hamilton county, Tennessee, to recover from respondent the penalty imposed by that section. Respondent answered denying liability, and by cross-bill alleged the bankrupt owed it $25,493. 70 on notes, and prayed that it be allowed to set off its claim against any judgment that petitioner might obtain. Petitioner's answer to the crossbill asserted that recover of the penalty did not depend on payment of the debt.\n The chancellor found that the bankrupt paid and respondent knowingly received $5,235.55 as interest based on a rate in excess of that permitted and gave him judgment for double that amount. He ruled that after judgment petitioner's claim was subject to set-off and ordered that the amount awarded him be applied as a credit upon the debt. The state supreme court* held the set-off permissible under the Bankruptcy Act,  68a, 11 U.S.C.A.  108, and expressly authorized by section 8769 of the Tennessee Code and \n\n[303 \nU.S. 245, 247]\n\u00a0\n declared that petitioner would be required to do equity by having his claim credited on the larger one owing to the respondent by the bankrupt.\n The question is whether respondent is entitled to have the amount of the judgment for penalty credited on its claim against the bankrupt estate.\n When the bank knowingly received illegal interest, it immediately became liable for, and the borrower became entitled to recover from it, a penalty of twice the amount of the interest thus paid. Farmers', etc., National Bank v. Dearing, \n91 \nU.S. 29\n; Lake Benton First National Bank v. Watt, \n184 \nU.S. 151\n, 22 S.Ct. 457. Upon petitioner's appointment as trustee in bankruptcy, the bankrupt's right to recover the penalty vested in him. Bankruptcy Act,  70a, as amended, 11 U. S.C.  110(a), 11 U.S.C.A.  110(a); First National Bank v. Lasater, \n196 \nU.S. 115, 118\n, 25 S.Ct. 206; Reed v. American-German National Bank, C.C., 155 F. 233. The penalty is to be enforced according to the terms of the statute. Guilt being established, the law itself fixes the punishment at precisely twice the usurious exaction paid; it may not be enhanced or mitigated because of aggravating circumstances or equitable considerations. As the sum demanded is certain, recovery in an action of debt is authorized, though the claim arises not in contract but in tort. Chaffee & Co. v. United States, 18 Wall. 516, 538. The liability can only be enforced in an action 'brought specially and exclusively for that purpose-where the sole issue is the guilt or innocence of the accused, without the presence of any extraneous facts which might confuse the case.' Barnet v. National Bank, \n98 \nU.S. 555\n, 559. One paying a national bank usurious interest and entitled to enforce the penalty may not recover it by way of set-off in a suit brought upon his note to the bank. Haseltine v. Central Bank of Springfield, \n183 \nU.S. 132, 137\n, 22 S.Ct. 50; Barnet v. National Bank, supra; Dreisbach v. National bank, \n104 \nU.S. 52\n; Stephens v. Monongahela Bank, \n111 \nU.S. 197\n, 4 S.Ct. 336. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 245, 248]\n\u00a0\n See Schuyler Nat. Bank v. Gadsden, \n191 \nU.S. 451, 456\n, 24 S.Ct. 129.\n Reasons, at least as cogent as those that uphold that rule, support the contention that the state court erred in permitting respondent to credit the amount of petitioner's judgment for penalty upon the notes given it by the bankrupt. To allow respondent to satisfy the judgment for penalty by mere deduction from its claim against the bankrupt's estate is to detract from the punishment definitely prescribed. The sentence specifically required by the law may not be cut down by implication, set- off or construction; for that would narrow the statute the tend to defeat its purpose. See United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95; Fasulo v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 620, 628\n, 47 S.Ct. 200, 201.\n The right of set-off here involved does not at all depend upon the Tennessee statute upon which, at least in part, the state supreme court rested its ruling. Sections 5197 and 5198, Revised Statutes, 12 U.S.C.A.  85, 86, define petitioner's right to recover, and respondent's liability for, the penalty; the Bankruptcy Act governs liquidation and distribution of the bankrupt's estate. It results that the validity of the challenged provision of the decree depends upon the right of set-off in bankruptcy. Bankruptcy Act,  68a, 11 U.S.C.  108(a), 11 U.S.C.A.  108(a). Cf. Yates v. Jones National Bank, \n206 \nU.S. 158, 179\n, 27 S.Ct. 638; Farmers', etc., National Bank v. Dearing, supra; McDaniel National Bank v. Bridwell, 8 Cir., 74 F.2d 331.\n Section 68a declares: 'In all cases of mutual debts or mutual credits between the estate of a bankrupt and a creditor the account shall be stated and one debt shall be set off against the other, and the balance only shall be allowed or paid.' The words 'debts' and 'credits' as there used are correlative. What is a debt on one side is a credit on the other. Libby v. Hopkins, 104 U.S. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 245, 249]\n\u00a0\n 303, 309. Liability for the penalty does not arise in contract but is laid in invitum as a disciplinary measure. Nor does the judgment determining the extent of guilt and declaring sentence change the liability for penalty to one for debt. Chase v. Curtis, \n113 \nU.S. 452, 463\n, 464 S., 5 S.Ct. 554; Boynton v. Ball, \n121 \nU.S. 457, 465\n, 466 S., 7 S.Ct. 981.\n As the penalty may be enforced only in a suit brought exclusively for that purpose so that the trial of guilt or innocence may not be embarrassed by any other question, it is plain that the payment of any debt owed by the plaintiff to the bank may not be held a condition precedent to the determination of that issue. Punishment for usury does not depend upon payment of the borrower's debt. It follows that respondent is not entitled to satisfy petitioner's judgment by deducting the amount of it from respondent's claim against the bankrupt's estate. Meredith v. American Nat. Bank, 127 Tenn. 90, 94, 153 S.W. 479; Exeter Nat. Bank v. Orchard, 43 Neb. 579, 582, 61 N.W. 833; Morehouse v. Second National Bank, 30 Hun, N.Y., 628. Reason, well supported by authority, requires that the penalty for usury so specifically prescribed shall be paid according to the terms of the statute.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 12 U.S.C.  85, 12 U.S.C.A.  85. \n\n[\nFootnote *\n] No opinion for publication.-Editor. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 12 U.S.C.  86, 12 U.S.C.A.  86: 'The taking, receiving, reserving, or charging a rate of interest greater than is allowed by the preceding section, when knowingly done, shall be deemed a forfeiture of the entire interest which the note, bill, or other evidence of debt carries with it, or which has been agreed to be paid thereon.

THOMPSON(1938)\nNo. 55\nArgued: Decided: December 5, 1938\n\n\n\n Messrs. Lloyd E. Price and T. S. Christopher, both of Fort Worth, Tex ., for petitioner.\n Messrs. William McCraw and Albert G. Walker, both of Austin, Tex., for respondents. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 263, 264]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner brought this suit in the federal court for the northern district of Texas against the members of the Texas Railroad Commission and its enforcement officers to enjoin them from enforcing against him the state Motor Truck Law. 1 Respondents answered; there was a trial; the court made findings of fact, stated its conclusions of law, and entered a decree permanently enjoining respondents from interfering with petitioner's business in interstate transportation. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded with directions to dismiss the bill. 5 Cir., 95 F.2d 937. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n305 \nU.S. 580\n, 59 S. Ct. 64, 83 L.Ed. --.\n Section 3 of the state law requires every carrier of property by motor for hire over public highways of the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 263, 265]\n\u00a0\n State to obtain from the Railroad Commission a certificate of convenience and necessity. Section 4 makes it the duty of the commission to regulate the transportation, to prescribe rules for safety of carriers' operations, and to supervise all matters affecting relationships between the carriers and the public.\n The federal Motor Carrier Act, 1935,2  206(a), declares that no common carrier by motor vehicle subject to its provisions shall engage in interstate commerce unless there is in force with respect to such carrier a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission authorizing the operation. A proviso in that section declares that, if any such carrier 'was in bona fide operation as a common carrier by motor vehicle on June 1, 1935,' over routes for which application is made and has so operated since that time, the commission shall issue the certificate without requiring further proof that public convenience and necessity will be served by the carrier's operation. Pending determination of the application, the applicant is authorized to continue operations.\n Since some time before the passage of the Act, petitioner has been continuously using Texas highways in interstate transportation of property by motor vehicle for hire. Claiming to have been in bona fide operation as contemplated by the proviso, he made timely application to the Interstate Commerce Commission for a certificate authorizing him to continue to operate over the highways he has been using. The application is still pending, and petitioner insists that, notwithstanding state law, he is entitled to continue operations under the proviso. The question first to be decided is whether his claim of bona fide operation is well founded.\n In May of 1934 he applied to the state commission for a certificate authorizing operation as a common carrier in \n\n[305 \nU.S. 263, 266]\n\u00a0\n interstate commerce. July 14, 1934, the commission denied the application on the ground that the proposed operations would subject the highways named in it to excessive burden and endanger and interfere with ordinary use by the public. Petitioner appealed to the district court of Travis county and obtained a decree enjoining the commission from interfering with his operations. The Court of Civil Appeals, January 8, 1936, reversed and dissolved the injunction. Railroad Commission v. McDonald, 90 S.W.2d 581. Thus it appears that petitioner's operations have been without authority of the Texas Commission and, unless within the proviso of the federal Act, without authority of federal law.\n Exact definition of 'bona fide operation' is not necessary. As the Act is remedial and to be construed liberally, the proviso defining exemptions is to be read in harmony with the purpose of the measure and held to extend only to carriers plainly within its terms. Piedmont & Northern Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm., \n286 \nU.S. 299, 311\n, 52 S.Ct. 541, 545. To limit the meaning to mere physical operation would be to eliminate 'bona fide'. That would be contrary to the rule that all words of a statute are to be taken into account and given effect if that can be done consistently with the plainly disclosed legislative intent. Ginsberg & Sons v. Poplin, \n285 \nU.S. 204, 208\n, 52 S.Ct. 322, 323; Ginsberg & Sons v. Popkin, \n285 \nU.S. 49\n S.Ct. 43, 44. There is nothing to justify rejection of these qualifying words. The expression, 'in bona fide operation', suggests absence of evasion, excludes the idea that mere ability to serve as a common carrier is enough, includes actual rather than potential or simulated service, and in context implies recognition of the power of the State to withhold or condition the use of its highways in the business of transportation for hire. Plainly the proviso does not extend to one operating as a common carrier on public highways of a State in defiance of its laws. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 263, 267]\n\u00a0\n As petitioner is not protected in his operation as a common carrier by the proviso, we need not consider to what extent, if at all, the federal Motor Carrier Act superseded the state Motor Truck Law, or any other question presented by petitioner.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Acts Reg.Sess., 42d Leg., 1931, c. 277, Vernon's Tex.Ann.Civ.St. Art. 911b. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of August 9, 1935, 49 Stat. 543, 551, 49 U.S.C.  306(a), 49 U.

HELVERING(1938)\nNo. 106\nArgued: December 16, 1937Decided: January 17, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 609, 610]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James G. Nye, of Duluth, Minn., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, in 1928, brought about the organization of the Peterson Investment Company, and transferred to it certain assets in exchange for the entire capital stock of that company. The stock was immediately distributed to petitioner's stockholders. Soon thereafter, petitioner transferred its remaining assets to Grand Union Company in exchange for 18, 000 shares of that company's stock and $426,842.52 in cash. The cash was immediately transferred to and divided among petitioner's stockholders, in proportion to their stock holdings, in pursuance of a plan of reorganization. The Board of Tax Appeals, upon its first consideration of the case, held that no reorganization had been effected under section 112( i)(1)(B) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A.  112 note. Minnesota Tea Co. v. Com'r, 28 B.T.A. 591. The Circuit Court of Appeals concluded otherwise, reversed the Board, and remanded the case to the Board for further consideration. 8 Cir., 76 F.2d 797. Upon review, pursuant to a writ of certiorari, we affirmed the judgment of the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 609, 611]\n\u00a0\n Circuit Court of Appeals. Helvering v. Minnesota Tea Co., \n296 \nU.S. 378\n, 56 S.Ct. 269.\n Upon the remand, the Board, after consideration, refused to follow the ruling of the Commissioner that $106,471.73 of the $426,842.52 constituted taxable assets in the hands of petitioner. Minnesota Tea Co. v. Com'r, 34 B.T.A. 145. The court below, reversing the action of the Board, sustained the view of the Commissioner, 8 Cir., 89 F.2d 711; and the case again comes here upon writ of certiorari. \n302 \nU.S. 665\n, 58 S.Ct. 16, 82 L. Ed. --.\n The facts are not in dispute. In addition to those already stated, it appears that immediately before the receipt by petitioner of the $426,842. 52, its stockholders, at a special meeting, adopted the following resolution: 'Resolved further that all moneys received by Minnesota Tea Company on such sale of its assets and in consideration thereof, whenever received, shall be immediately distributed to the stockholders of Minnesota Tea Company ratably and in the proportion of their respective stockholdings in Minnesota Tea Company upon the assumption by the stockholders of all the corporate debts of Minnesota Tea Company in order to enable the company to hold all the corporate stock or securities received by it for its assets on such sale thereof without being compelled to sell any part of the same, and the Board of Directors are hereby authorized and directed to so distribute the said moneys as aforesaid and in behalf of the company enter into a written agreement with the stockholders, signed and executed by the company and all the stockholders whereby said stockholders, in consideration of such distribution and for the purpose of enabling the company to continue to hold the said corporate stock and securities without being compelled to sell any part thereof for the payment of existing debts, agree to pay all the corporate debts of the Minnesota Tea Company whether due and payable or not and whether certain or contingent.' \n\n[302 \nU.S. 609, 612]\n\u00a0\n When the cash was 'distributed,' petitioner's debts amounted to $106, 471.73, about $6,500 of which was owing to the stockholders themselves. In pursuance of the resolution, the stockholders paid all the debts, retaining sums, aggregating about $6,500, necessary to discharge the amount of petitioner's indebtedness to them.\n The question for determination is whether the delivery of the $106, 471.73 by petitioner to the stockholders, an equal sum thereafter being applied by them to the payment of petitioner's debts in pursuance of the resolution, constituted a distribution within the meaning of the provisions of section 112(d)(1) and (2) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S. C.A.  112(d)(1, 2) and note, copied in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n These provisions plainly establish that, in respect of any cash received and not 'distributed,' there was a taxable gain to petitioner. And, quite as plainly, payment of the debts by petitioner, if made directly by petitioner to the creditors, would not have been a distribution under the statute; for that contemplates a distribution to stockholders, and not payment to creditors. If, then, petitioner had followed the simple course of retaining in its own hands the sum here in question, and subsequently paying it directly to the creditors, it necessarily would \n\n[302 \nU.S. 609, 613]\n\u00a0\n result that liability of petitioner for a tax on the amount of gain could not be avoided. And, obviously, this is the effect of what was done, although circuitously.\n The money was received by petitioner and was available for the payment of its debts. It was put into the hands of the stockholders upon the express understanding, as shown by the resolution heretofore quoted, that they would assume all the corporate debts of petitioner, and would enter into a written agreement with petitioner 'whereby said stockholders, in consideration of such distribution and for the purpose of enabling the company to continue to hold' the corporate stock and securities which it had received in the reorganization 'without being compelled to sell any part thereof for the payment of existing debts, agree to pay all the corporate debts of the Minnesota Tea Company. ...'\n In pursuance of the resolution, the stockholders received the money from petitioner to the extent of $106,471.73, not as a distribution for their benefit, but as a fund the equivalent of which they were bound to pass on, and did pass on, to the creditors. The conclusion is inescapable, as the court below very clearly pointed out, that by this roundabout process petitioner received the same benefit 'as though it had retained that amount from distribution and applied it to the payment of such indebtedness.' Payment of indebtedness, and not distribution of dividends, was, from the beginning, the aim of the understanding with the stockholders and was the end accomplished by carrying that understanding into effect. A given result at the end of a straight path is not made a different result because reached by following a devious path. The preliminary distribution to the stockholders was a meaningless and unnecessary incident in the transmission of the fund to the creditors, all along intended to come to their hands, so transparently artificial that further discussion would be a needless waste of time. The \n\n[302 \nU.S. 609, 614]\n\u00a0\n relation of the stockholders to the matter was that of a mere conduit. The controlling principle will be found in Gregory v. Helvering, \n293 \nU.S. 465, 469\n, 470 S., 55 S.Ct. 266, 267, 97 A.L.R. 1355; and applying that principle here, the judgment of the court below is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '(d) Same-Gain of corporation. If an exchange would be within the provisions of subsection (b)(4) of this section if it were not for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of stock or securities permitted by such paragraph to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of other property or money, then-\n'(1) If the corporation receiving such other property or money distributes it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, no gain to the corporation shall be recognized from the exchange, but\n\n'(2) If the corporation receiving such other property or money does not distribute it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, the gain, if any, to the corporation shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property so received, which is not so distributed.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","102":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOOKINI v.

The act authorized this Court 'to prescribe, from time to time, rules of practice and procedure with respect to any or all proceedings after verdict, or finding of guilt by the court if a jury has been waived, or plea of guilty, in criminal cases in district courts of the United States, including the District Courts of Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Canal Zone, and Virgin Islands, in the Supreme Courts of the District of Columbia, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, in the United States Court for China, in the United States Circuit Courts of Appeals, in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, and in the Supreme Court of the United States.'\n In order to aid the Court in exercising its authority under the statute, the Attorney General of the United States at the request of the Court submitted on May 26, 1933, a draft of proposed rules. These were expressly limited to proceedings in cases brought in the District Courts of the United States and in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. The reason for this limitation was thus stated by the Attorney General: 'The Rules are limited in their application to proceedings in cases instituted in the District Courts of the United States and in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. There is not sufficient data at hand upon \n\n[303 \nU.S. 201, 204]\n\u00a0\n which to predicate proposals at this time relative to practice and procedure in cases instituted in the District Courts of Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Canal Zone, and Virgin Islands, or in the Supreme Courts of Hawaii and Puerto Rico, or in the United States Court for China. It is thought that it would be the part of wisdom to establish the rules for practice and procedure for Continental United States before attempting to provide for the Territories, Insular Possessions and Consular Courts, as these situations will undoubtedly require special treatment because of local conditions and the distance separating the trial court from the Appellate Court.'\n In considering and revising the draft thus submitted, we approved this suggestion. The rules were accordingly limited to proceedings 'in criminal cases in District Courts of the United States and in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, and in all subsequent proceedings in such cases in the United States Circuit Courts of Appeals, in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, and in the Supreme Court of the United States.' Order of May 7, 1934, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723a; \n292 \nU.S. 661\n.\n No provision was made with respect to proceedings in cases brought in the District Courts of Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Canal Zone, and Virgin Islands, in the Supreme Courts of Hawaii and Puerto Rico, or in the United States Court for China. We entertain no doubt of our authority to limit the application of the new rules in this way. The statute empowered the Court to prescribe rules 'from time to time' with respect 'to any or all proceedings,' after determination of guilt, in criminal cases in the courts which were severally described. The statute contains no requirement that the Court must prescribe identical rules with respect to all the courts mentioned regardless of varying conditions, or that rules for all these courts must be prescribed at one and the same time. On \n\n[303 \nU.S. 201, 205]\n\u00a0\n the contrary, the manifest intention of the Congress was to permit the Court to exercise its discretion concerning the application of the rules.\n The term 'District Courts of the United States,' as used in the rules, without an addition expressing a wider connotation, has its historic significance. It describes the constitutional courts created under article 3 of the Constitution. Courts of the Territories are legislative courts, properly speaking, and are not District Courts of the United States. We have often held that vesting a territorial court with jurisdiction similar to that vested in the District Courts of the United States does not make it a 'District Court of the United States.'

Not only did the promulgating order use the term District Courts of the United States in its historic and proper sense, but the omission of provision for the application of the rules to the territorial courts and other courts mentioned in the authorizing act clearly shows the limitation that was intended.\n As the Criminal Appeals Rules were not made applicable to the District Court of the Territory of Hawaii, they did not supersede or alter the provisions of the Act of February 13, 1925, as to appeals from that court to the Circuit Court of Appeals. 28 U.S.C.  225, 230, 28 U.S.C.A.  225, 230. The provision of the Organic Act of Hawaii, 48 U.S.C.  645, 48 U.S.C.A.  645, to which the court below refers, that appeals from the District Court of the Territory to the Circuit Court of Appeals should be taken in the same manner as appeals from District Courts, was always subject to modification in the discretion of the Congress which in its future legislation could make or authorize such distinctions in ap- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 201, 206]\n\u00a0\n pellate procedure as appeared to be wise. The act authorizing this Court to promulgate rules for criminal appeals, which should have the effect of legislation, necessarily modified the former statutory provisions so as to give the Court full authority to prescribe the time and manner of taking appeals and to leave the Court free to determine to what courts, within the range of the authorization, its rules should apply. Pursuant to this authority, the Court has limited its rules so that they do not govern appeals from the District Court of the Territory of Hawaii, and there is nothing in the earlier legislation which compels the extension of the rules beyond their intended and expressed application.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] For opinion of Circuit Court of Appeals after remandment, see 95 F. 2d 960. \n\n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOREHEAD v.

Packers and Stockyards Act 1921, 42 Stat. 159; 7 U.S.C.  181-229, 7 U.S.C.A.  181 et seq. The District Court of three judges dismissed the bills of complaint in fifty suits ( consolidated for hearing) challenging the validity of the rates, and the plaintiffs brings this direct appeal. 7 U.S.C.  217, 7 U.S.C.A.  217; 28 U.S.C.  47, 28 U.S.C.A.  47.\n The case comes here for the second time. On the former appeal we met, at the threshold of the controversy, the contention that the plaintiffs had not been accorded the hearing which the statute made a prerequisite to a valid order. The District Court had struck from plaintiffs' bills the allegations that the Secretary had made the order \n\n[304 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n without having heard or read the evidence and without having heard or considered the arguments submitted, and that his sole information with respect to the proceeding was derived from consultation with employees in the Department of Agriculture. We held that it was error to strike these allegations, that the defendant should be required to answer them, and that the question whether plaintiffs had a proper hearing should be determined. \n298 \nU.S. 468\n, 56 S.Ct. 906\n\n\n After the remand, the bills were amended and interrogatories were directed to the Secretary which he answered. The court received the evidence which had been introduced at its previous hearing, together with additional testimony bearing upon the nature of the hearing accorded by the Secretary. This evidence embraced the testimony of the Secretary and of several of his assistants. The District Court rendered an opinion, with findings of fact and conclusions of law, holding that the hearing before the Secretary was adequate and, on the merits, that his order was lawful. On this appeal, plaintiffs again contend (1) that the Secretary's order was made without the hearing required by the statute; and (2) that the order was arbitrary and unsupported by substantial evidence.\n The first question goes to the very foundation of the action of administrative agencies intrusted by the Congress with broad control over activities which in their detail cannot be dealt with directly by the Legislature. The vest expansion of this field of administrative regulation in response to the pressure of social needs is made possible under our system by adherence to the basic principles that the Legislature shall appropriately determine the standards of administrative action and that in administrative proceedings of a quasi-judicial character the liberty and property of the citizen shall be protected by the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n rudimentary requirements of fair play. These demand 'a fair and open hearing,' essential alike to the legal validity of the administrative regulation and to the maintenance of public confidence in the value and soundness of this important governmental process. Such a hearing has been described as an 'inexorable safeguard.' St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 38, 73\n, 56 S.Ct. 720, 735; Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n301 \nU.S. 292, 304\n, 305 S., 57 S.Ct. 724, 730; Railroad Commission of California v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co., \n302 \nU.S. 388, 393\n, 58 S.Ct. 334, 338; Morgan v. United States, supra. And in equipping the Secretary of Agriculture with extraordinary powers under the Packers and Stockyards Act, the Congress explicitly recognized and emphasized this requirement by making his action depend upon a 'full hearing.' Section 310.1\n In the record now before us the controlling facts stand out clearly. The original administrative proceeding was begun on April 7, 1930, when the Secretary of Agriculture issued an order of inquiry and notice of hearing with re- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n spect to the reasonableness of the charges of appellants for stockyards services at Kansas City. The taking of evidence before an examiner of the Department was begun on December 3, 1930, and continued until February 10, 1931. The Government and appellants were represented by counsel, and voluminous testimony and exhibits were introduced. In March, 1931, oral argument was had before the Acting Secretary of Agriculture and appellants submitted a brief. On May 18, 1932, the Secretary issued his findings and an order prescribing maximum rates. In view of changed economic conditions, the Secretary vacated that order and granted a rehearing. That was begun on October 6, 1932, and the taking of evidence was concluded on November 16, 1932. The evidence received at the first hearing was resubmitted, and this was supplemented by additional testimony and exhibits. On March 24, 1933, oral argument was had before Rexford G. Tugwell as Acting Secretary.\n It appears that there were about 10,000 pages of transcript of oral evidence and over 1,000 pages of statistical exhibits. The oral argument was general and sketchy. Appellants submitted the brief which they had presented after the first administrative hearing and a supplemental brief dealing with the evidence introduced upon the rehearing. No brief was at any time supplied by the Government. Apart from what was said on its behalf in the oral argument, the Government formulated no issues and furnished appellants no statement or summary of its contentions and no proposed findings. Appellants' request that the examiner prepare a tentative report, to be submitted as a basis for exceptions and argument, was refused.\n Findings were prepared in the Bureau of Animal Industry, Department of Agriculture, whose representatives had conducted the proceedings for the Government, and were submitted to the Secretary who signed them, with a few \n\n[304 \nU.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n changes in the rates, when his order was made on June 14, 1933. These findings, 180 in number, were elaborate. They dealt with the practices and facilities at the Kansas City livestock market, the character of appellants' business and services, their rates and the volume of their transactions, their gross revenues, their methods in getting and maintaining business, their joint activities, the economic changes since the year 1929, the principles which governed the determination of reasonable commission rates, the classification of cost items, the reasonable unit costs plus a reasonable amount of profits to be covered into reasonable commission rates, the reasonable amounts to be included for salesmanship, yarding salaries and expenses, office salaries and expenses, business getting and maintaining expenses, administrative and general expenses, insurance, interest on capital, and profits, together with summary and the establishment of the rate structure. Upon the basis of the reasonable costs as thus determined, the Secretary found that appellants' schedules of rates were unreasonable and unjustly discriminatory, and fixed the maximum schedules of the just and reasonable rates thereafter to be charged.\n No opportunity was afforded to appellants for the examination of the findings thus prepared in the Bureau of Animal Industry until they were served with the order. Appellants sought a rehearing by the Secretary, but their application was denied on July 6, 1933, and these suits followed.\n The part taken by the Secretary himself in the departmental proceedings is shown by his full and candid testimony. The evidence had been received before he took office. He did not hear the oral argument. The bulky record was placed upon his desk and he dipped into it from time to time to get its drift. He decided that probably the essence of the evidence was contained in appellants' briefs. These, together with the transcript of the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n oral argument, he took home with him and read. He had several conferences with the Solicitor of the Department and with the officials in the Bureau of Animal Industry, and discussed the proposed findings. He testified that he considered the evidence before signing the order. The substance of his action is stated in his answer to the question whether the order represented his independent conclusion, as follows: 'My answer to the question would be that that very definitely was my independent conclusion as based on the findings of the men in the Bureau of Animal Industry. I would say, I will try to put it as accurately as possible, that it represented my own independent reactions to the findings of the men in the Bureau of Animal Industry.'\n Save for certain rate alterations, he 'accepted the findings.'\n In the light of this testimony there is no occasion to discuss the extent to which the Secretary examined the evidence, and we agree with the Government's contention that it was not the function of the court to probe the mental processes of the Secretary in reaching his conclusions if he gave the hearing which the law required. The Secretary read the summary presented by appellants' briefs and he conferred with his subordinates who had sifted and analyzed the evidence. We assume that the Secretary sufficiently understood its purport. But a 'full hearing'-a fair and open hearing-requires more than that. The right to a hearing embraces not only the right to present evidence, but also a reasonable opportunity to know the claims of the opposing party and to meet them. The right to submit argument implies that opportunity; otherwise the right may be but a barren one. Those who are brought into contest with the Government in a quasijudicial proceeding aimed at the control of their activities are entitled to be fairly advised of what the Government pro- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n poses and to be heard upon its proposals before it issues its final command.\n No such reasonable opportunity was accorded appellants. The administrative proceeding was initiated by a notice of inquiry into the reasonableness of appellants' rates. No specific complaint was formulated and, in a proceeding thus begun by the Secretary on his own initiative, none was required. Thus, in the absence of any definite complaint, and in a sweeping investigation, thousands of pages of testimony were taken by the examiner and numerous complicated exhibits were introduced bearing upon all phases of the broad subject of the conduct of the market agencies. In the absence of any report by the examiner or any findings proposed by the Government, and thus without any concrete statement of the Government's claims, the parties approached the oral argument.\n Nor did the oral argument reveal these claims in any appropriate manner. The discussion by counsel for the Government was 'very general,' as he said, in order not to take up 'too much time.' It dealt with generalities both as to principles and procedure. Counsel for appellants then discussed the evidence from his standpoint. The Government's counsel closed briefly, with a few additional and general observations. The oral argument was of the sort which might serve as a preface to a discussion of definite points in a brief, but the Government did not submit a brief. And the appellants had no further information of the Government's concrete claims until they were served with the Secretary's order.\n Congress, in requiring a 'full hearing,' had regard to judicial standards-not in any technical sense but with respect to those fundamental requirements of fairness which are of the essence of due process in a proceeding of a judicial nature. If in an equity cause, a special master \n\n[304 \nU.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n or the trial judge permitted the plaintiff's attorney to formulate the findings upon the evidence, conferred ex parte with the plaintiff's attorney regarding them, and then adopted his proposals without affording an opportunity to his opponent to know their contents and present objections, there would be no hesitation in setting aside the report or decree as having been made without a fair hearing. The requirements of fairness are not exhausted in the taking or consideration of evidence, but extend to the concluding parts of the procedure as well as to the beginning and intermediate steps.\n The answer that the proceeding before the Secretary was not of an adversary character, as it was not upon complaint but was initiated as a general inquiry, is futile. It has regard to the mere form of the proceeding and ignores realities. In all substantial respects, the Government acting through the Bureau of Animal Industry of the Department was prosecuting the proceeding against the owners of the market agencies. The proceeding had all the essential elements of contested litigation, with the Government and its counsel on the one side and the appellants and their counsel on the other. It is idle to say that this was not a proceeding in reality against the appellants when the very existence of their agencies was put in jeopardy. Upon the rates for their services the owners depended for their livelihood and the proceeding attacked them at a vital spot. This is well shown by the fact that, on the merits, appellants are here contending that under the Secretary's order many of these agencies, although not found to be inefficient or wasteful, will be left with deficits instead of reasonable compensation for their services, and will be compelled to go out of business. And to this the Government responds that if as a result of the prescribed rates some agencies may be unable to \n\n[304 \nU.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n continue, because through existing competition there are too many, that fact will not invalidate the order. While we are not now dealing with the merits, the breadth of the Secretary's discretion under our rulings applicable to such a proceeding, Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420\n, 50 S.Ct. 220; Acker v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 426\n, 56 S.Ct. 824, places in a strong light the necessity of maintaining the essentials of a full and fair hearing, with the right of the appellants to have a reasonable opportunity to know the claims advanced against them as shown by the findings proposed by the Bureau of Animal Industry.\n Equally unavailing is the contention that the former Secretary of Agriculture had made an order in May, 1932, containing findings of fact and fixing a schedule of rates, of which appellants were apprised. Because of changes in economic conditions, the Secretary himself had set aside that order and directed a rehearing. This necessarily involved, as the Secretary found, a consideration 'of changes both general and particular' which had 'occurred since the year 1929' and brought up all the questions pertinent to the new situation to which the additional evidence upon the rehearing was directed. The former findings and order were no longer in effect, and it is with the conduct of the later pro that we are concerned.\n The Government adverts to an observation in our former opinion that, while it was good practice-which we approved-to have the examiner, receiving the evidence in such a case, prepare a report as a basis for exceptions and argument, we could not say that that particular type of procedure was essential to the validity of the proceeding. That is true, for, as we said, what the statute requires 'relates to substance and not form.' Conceivably, the Secretary, in a case the narrow limits of which made such a procedure practicable, might himself hear \n\n[304 \nU.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n the evidence and the contentions of both parties and make his findings upon the spot. Again, the evidence being in, the Secretary might receive the proposed findings of both parties, each being notified of the proposals of the other, hear argument thereon, and make his own findings. But what would not be essential to the adequacy of the hearing if the Secretary himself makes the findings is not a criterion for a case in which the Secretary accepts and makes as his own the findings which have been prepared by the active prosecutors for the Government, after an ex parte discussion with them and without according any reasonable opportunity to the respondents in the proceeding to know the claims thus presented and to contest them. That is more than an irregularity in practice; it is a vital defect.\n The maintenance of proper standards on the part of administrative agencies in the performance of their quasijudicial functions is of the highest importance and in no way cripples or embarrasses the exercise of their appropriate authority. On the contrary, it is in their manifest interest. For, as we said at the outset, if these multiplying agencies deemed to be necessary in our complex society are to serve the purposes for which they are created and endowed with vast powers, they must accredit themselves by acting in accordance with the cherished judicial tradition embodying the basic concepts of fair play.\n As the hearing was fatally defective, the order of the Secretary was invalid. In this view, we express no opinion upon the merits. The decree of the District Court is reversed.\n It is so ordered.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK dissents.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n\n PER CURIAM.\n The Solicitor General moves for a rehearing of this case upon two grounds:\n First. The first ground is that the Court has reversed itself; that the present decision is 'directly contrary to the law of the case' as established by the Court's decision on the former appeal (Morgan v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 468\n, 56 S.Ct. 906); and that 'a procedural omission' previously held 'to be of no significance' is now regarded as 'fatally defective'.\n These assertions are unwarranted. Not only are the two decisions consistent, but the rule announced in our former opinion was applied and was decisive of the present appeal. And the Government is in no position to claim surprise. The question whether there had been a fair hearing in the present case, in the light of the situation disclosed by the Secretary's testimony and the other evidence, was fully argued at the bar. Appellants presented both orally and in an elaborate brief, with copious references to the record, the contention which we sustained.\n The first appeal was brought to this Court because the plaintiffs had been denied an opportunity to prove that the Secretary of Agriculture had failed to give them the full hearing which the statute required. Their allegations to that effect had been struck out by the District Court, 8 F. Supp. 766. We held its ruling to be erroneous and that the question whether the plaintiffs had a proper hearing should be determined, saying:\n'But there must be a hearing in a substantial sense. And to give the substance of a hearing, which is for the purpose of making determinations upon evidence, the officer who makes the determinations must consider and appraise the evidence which justifies them.' \n\n[304 \nU.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n The case was then tried by the District Court upon that issue. From the Secretary's frank disclosure it appeared that findings of fact necessary to sustain the order had not been made by him upon his own consideratio of the evidence but as stated below. Because such action fails to satisfy the requirement of a full hearing stated in our first opinion and quoted above, we reversed the judgment of the District Court which sustained the order.\n\n Testimony of the Secretary and his associates disclosed what had actually occurred. It appeared that the oral argument before the Assistant Secretary had been general and sketchy; that, aside from the oral argument, which did not reveal the claims of the Government in any appropriate manner, the Government had submitted no brief and no statement of its contentions had been furnished; that in this situation findings had been prepared in the Bureau of Animal Industry, Department of Agriculture, whose representatives had conducted the proceedings for the Government; that these findings, 180 in number, were elaborate, dealing with all phases of the practices and facilities at the Kansas City live-stock market, the services and methods of the plaintiffs, and the costs and profits which should be allowed them as reasonable. These findings, prepared not by the Secretary but by those who had prosecuted the case for the Government, were adopted by the Secretary with certain rate alterations. No opportunity was afforded to the plaintiffs for the examination of the findings thus prepared until they were served with the Secretary's order and their request for a rehearing was denied.\n The statement made in the petition for rehearing that the present decision is contrary to the law of the case as declared in our first opinion is wholly unfounded. Our decision was not rested upon the absence of an examiner's report. So far from departing from our former opinion, \n\n[304 \nU.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n or from the statement that the mere matter of the presence or absence of an examiner's report was not itself determinative, we reiterated both that statement and the principle underlying it in our opinion on the present appeal. We said (page 776 of 58 S.Ct.):\n'Those who are brought into contest with the Government in a quasijudicial proceeding aimed at the control of their activities are entitled to be fairly advised of what the Government proposes and to be heard upon its proposals before it issues its final command.\n\n'No such reasonable opportunity was accorded appellants. ...\n\n'The Government adverts to an observation in our former opinion that, while it was good practice-which we approved-to have the examiner, receiving the evidence in such a case, prepare a report as a basis for exceptions and argument, we could not say that that particular type of procedure was essential to the validity of the proceeding. That is true, for, as we said, what the statute requires 'relates to substance and not form.' Conceivably, the Secretary, in a case the narrow limits of which made such a procedure practicable, might himself hear the evidence and the contentions of both parties and make his findings upon the spot. Again the evidence being in, the Secretary might receive the proposed findings of both parties, each being notified of the proposals of the other, hear argument thereon, and make his own findings.'\n\n And, then, pointing out the distinction and the serious defect in the procedure in the instant case, we added:\n'But what would not be essential to the adequacy of the hearing if the Secretary himself makes the findings is not a criterion for a case in which the Secretary accepts and makes as his own the findings which have been prepared by the active prosecutors for the Government, after \n\n[304 \nU.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n an ex parte discussion with them and without according any reasonable opportunity to the respondents in the proceeding to know the claims thus presented and to contest them. That is more than an irregularity in practice; it is a vital defect.'\n\n The distinction was again brought out in our recent decision in the case of National Labor Relations Board v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co., \n304 \nU.S. 333\n, 58 S.Ct. 904, 82 L.Ed. --, May 16, 1938, where the mere absence of an examiner's report was found not to be controlling, as the record showed that in that case the contentions of the parties had been clearly defined and that there had been in the substantial sense a full and adequate hearing.\n The effort to establish a case for rehearing, either because of an asserted inconsistency in our rulings or because of lack of opportunity for full argument, is futile.\n Second. The second ground upon which a rehearing is sought is that there is impounded in the District Court a large sum representing charges paid in excess of the rates fixed by the Secretary. The Solicitor General raises questions both of substance and procedure as to the disposition of these moneys. These questions are appropriately for the District Court and they are not properly before us upon the present record. We have ruled that the order of the Secretary is invalid because the required hearing was not given. We remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with our opinion. What further proceedings the Secretary may see fit to take in the light of our decision, or what determinations may be made by the District Court in relation to any such proceedings, are not matters which we should attempt to forecast or hypothetically to decide.\n The petition for rehearing is denied.\n Mr. Justice BLACK dissents.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration of this petition. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n304 \nU.S. 1\n, 58 S.Ct. 999, 82 L.Ed. --.[ Morgan v.

These requirements were not complied with prior to July 1, 1933.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held the suit was not brought in time to toll the statute, and with this conclusion we agree. The opinion there adequately refers to the sundry opinions which have considered the subject, discloses the claims of the parties, and reasons for the judgment.\n Affirmation here, upon authority of United States v. Larkin, \n208 \nU.S. 333\n, 28 S.Ct. 417, of the District Court's judgment in United States v. Mill Creek, etc., and two similar causes (Nos. 103, 104, 105, Oct. Term 1919), \n251 \nU.S. 539\n, 40 S.Ct. 118, cannot properly be regarded as authority for a view contrary to the one we now approve. Those causes came up under a statute which permitted direct appeals from District Courts solely upon questions of jurisdiction. We determined only that the District Court had power to hear and rule upon the questions presented to it-among them whether the suits were brought in time. The merits of the controversy-whether in reality the suits were in time-we did not consider. Examination of the opin- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 36, 41]\n\u00a0\n ion in Larkin's Case and the statute then in force will make this clear enough.\n Suits against the United States can be maintained only by permission, in the manner prescribed and subject to the restrictions imposed. Reid v. United States, \n211 \nU.S. 529, 538\n, 29 S.Ct. 171. The Conformity Act, 28 U.S.C.A.  724, cannot be relied upon to change any of these.\n The district attorney had no power to waive conditions or limitations imposed by statute in respect of suits against the United States.

BETHLEHEM SHIPBUILDING CORP.(1938)\nNo. 181\nArgued: January 5, 1938Decided: January 31, 1938\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 41, 43]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Robert B. Watts, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Providence, R.I., for respondent Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation.\n Mr. B. A. Brickley, of Boston, Mass., for respondents MacKenzie and others.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether a federal District Court has equity jurisdiction to enjoin the National Labor Relations Board from holding a hearing upon a complaint filed by it against an employer alleged to be engaged in unfair labor practices prohibited by National Labor Relations Act, July 5, 1935, c. 372, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held in these cases that the District Court possesses such jurisdiction; and granted preliminary injunctions. Every other Circuit Court of Appeals in which the question has arisen has \n\n[303 \nU.S. 41, 44]\n\u00a0\n held the contrary. \n1\n Because of the importance of the questions presented, the conflict in the lower courts and alleged conflict with our own decisions, we granted these writs of certiorari. \n302 \nU.S. 667\n, 58 S.Ct. 26, 27, 82 L.Ed. --.\n The declared purpose of the National Labor Relations Act is to diminish the causes of labor disputes burdening and obstructing interstate and foreign commerce; and its provisions are applicable only to such commerce. In order to protect it, the act seeks to promote collective bargaining; confers upon employees engaged in such commerce the right to form, and join in, labor organizations; defines acts of an employer which shall be deemed unfair labor practice; and confers upon the Board certain limited powers with a view to preventing such practices. If a charge is made to the Board that a person 'has engaged in or is engaging in any ... unfair labor practice,' and it appears that a proceeding in respect thereto should be instituted, a complaint stating the charge is to be filed, and a hearing is to be held thereon upon notice to the person complained of.\n The Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America, Local No. 5, made to the Board a charge that the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Limited,2 was engaging in unfair labor practices at its plant in Quincy, Mass., for the production, sale, and \n\n[303 \nU.S. 41, 45]\n\u00a0\n distribution of boats, ships, and marine equipment. Upon that charge the Board filed, on April 13, 1936, a complaint which alleged, among other things, that the company dominates and interferes in the manner described 'with a labor organization known as Plan of Representation of Employees in Plants of the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Ltd.'; that such action leads to strikes interfering with interstate commerce; and that 'the aforesaid acts of respondent constitute unfair labor practices affecting commerce, within the meaning of Section 8, subdivisions (1) and (2) and Section 2, subdivisions (6) and (7) of said (National Labor Relations) Act ( 29 U.S.C.A.  158(1, 2), 152(6, 7)).'\n The complaint alleged, specifically:\n'The respondent in the course and conduct of its business causes and has continuously caused large quantities of the raw materials used in the production of its boats, ships and marine equipment to be purchased and transported in interstate commerce from and through states of the United States other than the State of Massachusetts to the Fore River Plant in the State of Massachusetts, and causes and has continuously caused the boats, ships and marine equipment produced by it to be sold and transported in interstate commerce from the Fore River Plant in the State of Massachusetts to, into and through states of the United States other than the State of Massachusetts, all of the aforesaid constituting a continuous flow of trade, traffic and commerce among the several states.'\n\n The Board duly notified the corporation that a hearing on the complaint would be held on April 27, 1936, at Boston, Mass., in accordance with rules and regulations of the Board, a copy of which was annexed to the notice; and that the corporation 'will have the right to appear, in person or otherwise, and give testimony.' \n\n[303 \nU.S. 41, 46]\n\u00a0\n On that day the corporation filed, in the federal court for Massachusetts, the bill in equity, herein numbered 181, against A. Howard Myers, acting regional director for the First Region, National Labor Relations Board, Edmund J. Blake, its regional attorney for the First Region, and Daniel M. Lyons, trial examiner, to enjoin them from holding 'a hearing for the purpose of determining whether or not the plaintiff has engaged at its Fore River Plant in any so-called unfair labor practices under the National Labor Relations Act, and from having any proceedings or taking any action whatsoever, at any time or times, with respect thereto.' There were prayers for a restraining order, an interlocutory injunction, and a permanent injunction; and also a prayer that the court declare that the National Labor Relations Act and 'defendants' actions and proposed actions thereunder' violate the Federal Constitution.\n On May 4, 1936, another bill in equity, herein numbered 182, against the same defendants, seeking, on largely the same allegations of fact, substantially the same relief, was brought in the same court by Charles MacKenzie, James E. Manning, and Thomas E. Barker, employees of the Bethlehem Corporation and officers of the so-called Plan of Representation at the Fore River Plant. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Upon the filing of each bill, the District Court issued a restraining order and an order of notice to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue. In each case the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the bill of complaint and also a return to the order to show cause. The cases were heard together. In each, the District Court issued the preliminary injunction; and the decrees therefor are still in efect. They were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on Febru- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 41, 47]\n\u00a0\n ary 12, 1937. 88 F.2d 154. Petitions for a rehearing, based upon the conflict with the decisions of other circuit courts of appeals, were denied. And the court denied also motions for leave to file a second petition for rehearing, based upon the decisions of this Court in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 108 A.L.R. 1352, and other cases rendered April 12, 1937. 1 Cir., 89 F.2d 1000. The District Court denied the motions to dismiss the bills. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp. v. Meyers, 15 F.Supp. 915. But the review by the Circuit Court of Appeals dealt only with the decrees for a preliminary injunction.\n The two cases present, in the main, the same questions. In discussing them reference will be made, in the first instance, only to the suit brought by the corporation.\n We are of opinion that the District Court was without power to enjoin the Board from holding the hearings.\n First. There is no claim by the corporation that the statutory provisions and the rules of procedure prescribed for such hearings are illegal; or that the corporation was not accorded ample opportunity to answer the complaint of the Board; or that opportunity to introduce evidence on the allegations made will be denied. The claim is that the provisions of the act are not applicable to the corporation's business at the Fore River Plant, because the operations conducted there are not carried on, and the products manufactured are not sold, in interstate or foreign commerce; that, therefore, the corporation's relations with its employees at the plant cannot burden or interfere with such commerce; that hearings would, at best, be futile; and that the holding of them would result in irreparable damage to the corporation, not only by reason of their direct cost and the loss of time of its officials and employees, but also because the hearings would cause serious impairment of the good will and harmonious relations existing between the corporation \n\n[303 \nU.S. 41, 48]\n\u00a0\n and its employees, and thus seriously impair the efficiency of its operations. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The District Court is without jurisdiction to enjoin hearings because the power 'to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair practice affecting commerce' has been vested by Congress in the Board and the Circuit Court of Appeals, and Congress has declared: 'This power shall be exclusive, and shall not be affected by any other means of adjustment or prevention that has been or may be established by agreement, code, law, or otherwise.' \n5\n The grant of that exclusive power is constitutional, because the act provided for appropriate procedure before the Board and in the review by the Circuit Court of Appeals an adequate opportunity to secure judicial protection against possible illegal action on the part of the Board. No power to enforce an order is conferred upon the Board. To secure enforcement, the Board must apply to a Circuit Court of Appeals for its affirmance. And, until the Board's order has been affirmed by the appropriate Circuit Court of Appeals, no penalty accrues for disobeying it. The independent right to apply to a Circuit Court of Appeals to have an order set aside \n\n[303 \nU.S. 41, 49]\n\u00a0\n is conferred upon any party aggrieved by the proceeding before the Board. The Board is even without power to enforce obedience to its subpoena to testify or to produce written evidence. To enforce obedience it must apply to a District Court; and to such an application appropriate defense may be made. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n As was said in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1, 46\n, 47 S., 57 S.Ct. 615, 628, 108 A.L. R. 1352, the procedural provisions 'do not offend against the constitutional requirements governing the creation and action of administrative bodies. See Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 33 S.Ct. 185. The act establishes standards to which the Board must conform. There must be complaint, notice and hearing. The Board must receive evidence and make findings. The findings as to the facts are to be conclusive, but only if supported by evidence. The order of the Board is subject to review by the designated court, and only when sustained by the court may the order be enforced. Upon that review all questions of the jurisdiction of the Board and the regularity of its proceedings, all questions of constitutional right or statutory authority are open to examination by the court. We construe the procedural provisions as affording adequate opportunity to secure judicial protection against arbitrary action in accordance with the well-settled rules applicable to administrative agencies set up by Congress to aid in the enforcement of valid legislation.'\n It is true that the Board has jurisdiction only if the complaint concerns interstate or foreign commerce. Unless the Board finds that it does, the complaint must be dismissed. And, if it finds that interstate or foreign commerce \n\n[303 \nU.S. 41, 50]\n\u00a0\n is involved, but the Circuit Court of Appeals concludes that such finding was without adequate evidence to support it, or otherwise contrary to law, the Board's petition to enforce it will be dismissed, or the employer's petition to have it set aside will be granted. \n7\n Since the procedure before the Board is appropriate and the judicial review so provided is adequate, Congress had power to vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Board and the Circuit Court of Appeals. Anniston Manufacturing Co. v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 337\n, 343-346, 57 S.Ct. 816, 819, 820\n\n\n Third. The corporation contends that, since it denies that interstate or foreign commerce is involved and claims that a hearing would subject it to irreparable damage, rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution will be denied unless it be held that the District Court has jurisdiction to enjoin the holding of a hearing by the Board. \n8\n So to hold would, as the government insists, in effect substitute the District Court for the Board as the tribunal to hear and determine what Congress declared the Board exclusively should hear and determine in the first instance. The contention is at war with the long-settled rule of judicial administration that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the pre- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 41, 51]\n\u00a0\n scribed administrative remedy has been exhausted. \n9\n That rule has been repeatedly acted on in cases where, as here, the contention is made that the administrative body lacked power over the subject matter. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Obviously, the rules requiring exhaustion of the administrative remedy cannot be circumvented by asserting that the charge on which the complaint rests is groundless and that the mere holding of the prescribed administrative hearing would result in irreparable damage. \n11\n Lawsuits also often prove to have been ground- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 41, 52]\n\u00a0\n less; but no way has been discovered of relieving a defendant from the necessity of a trial to establish the fact.\n Fourth. The Circuit Court of Appeals should have reversed the decrees for a preliminary injunction. It is true that ordinarily the decree of a District Court granting or denying a preliminary injunction will not be disturbed on appeal. But that rule of practice has no application where, as here, there was an insuperable objection to the maintenance of the suit in point of jurisdiction and where it clearly appears that the decree was the result of an improvident exercise of judicial discretion. \n12\n Since the constitutionality of the act has been determined by our decision in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 108 A.L.R. 1352, and \n\n[303 \nU.S. 41, 53]\n\u00a0\n the defect in the bill is incapable of remedy by amendment, its dismissal should be directed. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n Fifth. In No. 182, also, the Circuit Court of Appeals should have reversed the decree for a preliminary injunction and directed dismissal of the bill. The plaintiffs, officers of the so-called Plan of Representation of Employees, alleged, in addition to the facts already stated, that the employees are satisfied with their existing contracts of employment and desire to retain the existing plan without change; that the holding of the proposed hearing will discredit the plan and destroy its usefulness to the employees; that they will be deprived of their right to negotiate by the method of their choice, the value of which has been proved by years of operation; that alteration of the plan will cause dissatisfaction among the employees; that operation of plant will be disrupted by labor disturbances; that employment will be interrupted; and that the damage to the employees will be irreparable. These additional allegations furnish no reason why the Board should be prevented from exercising the exclusive initial jurisdiction conferred upon it by Congress.\n Decrees for preliminary injunction reversed, with direction to dismiss the bills.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] E.

Although the proceedings were eventually dismissed, the hearings consumed a total of some 2,500 hours of working time of officials and employees and cost the corporation more than $15,000, none of which could be recovered. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Compare House Committee Report, H.R. Rep. 1147, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 24: 'any person aggrieved by a final order of the Board granting or denying in whole or in part the relief sought may claim a review of such order in the appropriate circuit court of appeals, or in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. It is intended here to give the party aggrieved a full, expeditious, and exclusive method of review in one proceeding after a final order is made. Until such final order is made the party is not injured, and cannot be heard to complain, as has been held in cases under the Federal Trade Commission Act.' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Section 11 of the Act and article II, sections 20 and 21, of the Rules and Regulations issued April 27, 1936.

It maintains an office in San Francisco for the transaction of its business wherein it employs upwards of sixty supervisors, operators and clerks, many of whom are members of Local No. 3 of the American Radio Telegraphists Association, a national labor organization; the membership of the local comprising 'point-to-point' or land operators employed by respondent at San Francisco. Affiliated with the national organization also were locals whose members are exclusively marine operators who work upon ocean-going vessels. The respondent, at its San Francisco office, dealt with committees of Local No. 3; and its parent company, whose headquarters were in New York, dealt with representatives of the national organization. Demand was made by the latter for the execution of agreements respecting terms and conditions of employment \n\n[304 \nU.S. 333, 337]\n\u00a0\n of marine and point-to-point operators. On several occasions when representatives of the union conferred with officers of the respondent and its parent company the latter requested postponement of discussion of the proposed agreements and the union acceded to the requests. In September, 1935, the union pressed for immediate execution of agreements and took the position that no contract would be concluded by the one class of operators unless an agreement were simultaneously made with the other. Local No. 3 sent a representative to New York to be in touch with the negotiations and he kept its officers advised as to what there occurred. The local adopted a resolution to the effect that if satisfactory terms were not obtained by September 23 a strike of the San Francisco point-to-point operators should be called. The national officers determined on a general strike in view of the unsatisfactory state of the negotiations. This fact was communicated to Local No. 3 by its representative in New York and the local officers called out the employees of the San Francisco office. At midnight Friday, October 4, 1935, all the men there employed went on strike. The respondent, in order to maintain service, brought employees from its Los Angeles office and others from the New York and Chicago offices of the parent compay to fill the strikers' places.\n Although none of the San Francisco strikers returned to work Saturday, Sunday, or Monday, the strike proved unsuccessful in other parts of the country and, by Monday evening, October 7th, a number of the men became convinced that it would fail and that they had better return to work before their places were filled with new employees. One of them telephoned the respondent's traffic supervisor Monday evening to inquire whether the men might return. He was told that the respondent would take them back and it was arranged that the official should meet the employees at a downtown hotel and make a statement to \n\n[304 \nU.S. 333, 338]\n\u00a0\n them. Before leaving the company's office for this purpose the supervisor consulted with his superior, who told him that the men might return to work in their former positions but that, as the company had promised eleven men brought to San Francisco they might remain if they so desired, the supervisor would have to handle the return of the striking employees in such fashion as not to displace any of the new men who desired to continue in San Francisco. A little later the supervisor met two of the striking employees and gave them a list of all the strikers together with their addresses, and the telephone numbers of those who had telephones, and it was arranged that these two employees should telephone the strikers to come to a meeting at the Hotel Bellevue in the early hours of Tuesday, October 8th. In furnishing this list the supervisor stated that the men could return to work in a body but he checked off the names of eleven strikers who he said would have to file applications for reinstatement which applications would be subject to the approval of an executive of the company in New York. Because of this statement the two employees, in notifying the strikers of the proposed meeting, with the knowledge of the supervisor, omitted to communicate with the eleven men whose names had been checked off. Thirty-six men attended the meeting. Some of the eleven in question heard of it and attended. The supervisor appeared at the meeting and reiterated his statement that the men could go back to work at once but read from a list the names of the eleven who would be required to file applications for reinstatement to be passed upon in New York. Those present at the meeting voted on the question of immediately returning to work and the proposition was carried. Most of the men left the meeting and went to the respondent's office Tuesday morning, October 8th, where on that day they resumed their usual duties. Then or shortly thereafter six of the eleven in question took their places and resumed \n\n[304 \nU.S. 333, 339]\n\u00a0\n their work without challenge. It turned out that only five of the new men brought to San Francisco desired to stay.\n Five strikers who were prominent in the activities of the union and in connection with the strike, whose names appeared upon the list of eleven, reported at the office at various times between Tuesday and Thursday. Each of them was told that he would have to fill out an application for employment; that the roll of employees was complete, and that his application would be considered in connection with any vacancy that might thereafter occur. These men not having been reinstated in the course of three weeks, the secretary of Local No. 3 presented a charge to the National Labor Relations Board that the respondent had violated section 8(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act. \n4\n Thereupon the Board filed a complaint charging that the respondent had discharged and was refusing to employ the five men who had not been reinstated to their positions for the reason that they had joined and assisted the labor organization known as Local No. 3 and had engaged in concerted activities with other employees of the respondent for the purpose of collective bargaining and other mutual aid and protection; that by such discharge respondent had interfered with, restrained, and coerced the employees in the exercise of their rights guaranted by section 75 of the National Labor Relations Act and so had been guilty of an unfair labor practice within the meaning of section 8(1) of the act. The complaint further alleged that the discharge of these men was a discrimination in respect of their hire and tenure of employment and a discouragement of membership in Local No. 3, and thus an unfair labor practice within the meaning of section 8(3) of the act. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 333, 340]\n\u00a0\n The respondent filed an answer denying the allegations of the complaint, and moved to dismiss the proceeding on the ground that the act is unconstitutional. The motion was taken under advisement by the Board's examiner and the case proceeded to hearing. After the completion of its testimony the Board filed an amended complaint to comport with the evidence, in which it charged that the respondent had refused to re-employ the five operators for the reason that they had joined and assisted the labor organization known as Local No. 3 and engaged with other employees in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining and other mutual aid and protection; that the refusal to re-employ them restrained and coerced the employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed by section 7, and so constituted an unfair labor practice within section 8(1) of the act. The amended complaint further asserted that the refusal to reemploy the men discriminated in regard to their hire and tenure of employment and discouraged membership in Local No. 3 and thus amounted to an unfair labor practice under section 8(3) of the act. The respondent entered a general denial to the amended complaint and presented its evidence. At the conclusion of the testimony the Board transferred the cause for further hearing before the members of the Board at Washington and, after oral argument and the filing of a brief, made its findings of fact.\n The subsidiary or evidentiary facts were found in great detail and, upon the footing of them, the Board reached conclusions of fact to the effect that Local No. 3 is a labor organization within the meaning of the act; that 'by refusing to reinstate to employment' the five men in question, 'thereby discharging said employes,' the respondent by 'each of said discharges,' discriminated in regard to tenure of employment and thereby discouraged membership in the labor organization known as Local No. 3, and, by the described acts, 'has interfered with, restrained, \n\n[304 \nU.S. 333, 341]\n\u00a0\n and coerced its employes in the exercise of the rights guaranteed by section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.' As conclusions of law the Board found that the respondent had engaged in unfair labor practices affecting commerce within the meaning of section 8, subsections (1) and (3 ), and section 2, subsections (6) and (7),6 of the act. It entered an order that respondent cease and desist from discharging, or threatening to discharge, any of its employees for the reason that they had joined or assisted Local No. 3 or otherwise engaged in union activities; from interfering with, restraining or coercing its employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed by section 7 of the act; offer the five men immediate and full reinstatement to their former positions, without prejudice to rights and privileges previously enjoyed, and make each of them whole for any loss of wages due to their discharge; post notices that the respondent would not discharge or discriminate against members of, or those desiring to become members of, the union, and keep the notices posted for thirty days.\n As permitted by the act, the Board filed in the Circuit Court of Appeals a transcript of the record of its proceeding, and a petition for enforcement of its order. In its answer the respondent denied the jurisdiction of the court on the ground that the act violated article 3, and the Fifth, Seventh, andTe nth Amendments of the Constitution; that the order amounted to an abuse of discretion because arbitrary and capricious, and was not supported by the evidence; that the trial examiner erred in his rulings on evidence; that the Board erred in overruling exceptions to his rulings, and that the Board's findings of fact and conclusions of law were erroneous.\n Upon the hearing before the Circuit Court of Appeals one judge held that the action of the Board was within \n\n[304 \nU.S. 333, 342]\n\u00a0\n the power sought to be conferred upon it by the statute, but that the grant of power violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and the award of back pay to the employees, without a jury trial, violated the Seventh Amendment. Another judge held that as the statute defined employees to include a person whose work had ceased 'as a consequence of, or in connection with, any current labor dispute,' section 2(3), 29 U.S.C. A.  152(3), and since there was no allegation, evidence, or finding as to such a dispute, the strikers had ceased to be employees within the meaning of the act and the respondent's treatment of them could not violate the act One judge dissented, holding that the Board's order was within its statutory authority, and did not violate the Constitution. A petition and supplemental petition for rehearing were granted and, after argument, the court reaffirmed its former decision. The judge who had previously declared the Board's action within the terms of the statute, but unconstitutional, construed the act as not intended to work the unconstitutional result of compelling an employer to enter into a contract of employment against his will and, hence, as requiring only that the strikers be reinstated to the position of applicants for employment rather than employees. The other judges adhered to the views they had previously expressed.\n The petitioner contends the court erred in holding that men who struck because of a failure of negotiations concerning wages and terms of employment ceased to be employees within the meaning of the statute; erred in not holding it an unfair labor practice, forbidden by the statute, for an employer to discriminate because of union activities in the reinstatement of men who have gone on strike because of a failure of negotiations concerning wages and terms of employment; erred in failing to hold that the act authorizes the Board to order reinstatement of persons thus discriminated against; and one of the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 333, 343]\n\u00a0\n judges erred in holding that the act, if construed to authorize the Board to require such reinstatement, violates the Fifth Amendment.\n On the other hand, the respondent insists that it was not accorded due process of law because the unfair labor practice charged in the original complaint was abandoned and the action of the Board was based upon a conclusion of fact not within the issues presented; that there is no basis for the Board's order because there is no finding that the strikers ceased work as a consequence of, or in connection with, any labor dispute, as defined in the statute; that the act does not empower the Board to compel an employer to re-employ or reinstate those who have abandoned negotiations and gone on strike prior to any unfair labor practice, where the employer, after the strike is effective, and before committing any unfair labor practice, has permanently employed others in place of the strikers; that, if the act be held to authorize the Board's order, it violates the Fifth Amendment; that article 3 of the Constitution requires that the court render its independent judgment upon the quasijurisdictional facts upon which the Board's order was based; that the Board's order was, in the light of the facts, so arbitrary and capricious as to warrant the court's refusal to enforce it; and that the case is not properly before us because certiorari was not sought within the time fixed by law.\n We hold that we have jurisdiction; that the Board's order is within its competence and does not contravene any provision of the Constiut ion.\n First. Within the thirty days prescribed by the rules of the Circuit Court of Appeals the petitioner moved for a rehearing and for leave, if deemed appropriate, to take further evidence and add the same to the record before the Board. While this application was pending a supplemental petition for rehearing was presented. During the term the court entertained both petitions and granted a re- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 333, 344]\n\u00a0\n hearing and, after oral argument and submission of briefs, wrote further opinions based upon the petitions for rehearing. We think the court had not lost jurisdiction of the cause; that its final judgment was the order entered upon the petitions for rehearing and that the three months within which the petitioner must apply for certiorari ran from the date of the order dismissing the petition for rehearing and confirming the original order.\n Second. Under the findings the strike was a consequence of, or in connection with, a current labor dispute as defined in section 2(9) of the act, 29 U.S.C.A.  152(9). That there were pending negotiations for the execution of a contract touching wages and terms and conditions of employment of point-to-point operators cannot be denied. But it is said the record fails to disclose what caused these negotiations to fail or to show that the respondent was in any wise in fault in failing to comply with the union's demands; and, therefore, for all that appears, the strike was not called by reason of fault of the respondent. The argument confuses a current labor dispute with an unfair labor practice defined in section 8 of the act, 29 U.S.C.A.  158. True, there is no evidence that respondent had been guilty of any unfair labor practice prior to the strike, but within the intent of the act there was an existing labor dispute in connection with which the strike was called. The finding is that the strike was deemed 'advisable in view of the unsatisfactory state of the negotiations' in New York. It was unnecessary for the Board to find what was in fact the state of the negotiations in New York when the strike was called, or in so many words that a labor dispute as defined by the act existed. The wisdom or unwisdom of the men, their justification or lack of it, in attributing to respondent an unreasonable or arbitrary attitude in connection with the negotiations, cannot determine whether, when they struck, they did so as a consequence of, or in connection with, a current labor dispute. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 333, 345]\n\u00a0\n Third. The strikers remained employees under section 2(3) of the act, 29 U.S.C.A.  152(3), which provides: 'The term 'employee' shall include ... any individual whose work has ceased as a consequence of, or in connection with, any current labor dispute or because of any unfair labor practice, and who has not obtained any other regular and substantially equivalent employment ....' Within this definition the strikers remained employees for the purpose of the act and were protected against the unfair labor practices denounced by it.\n Fourth. It is contended that the Board lacked jurisdiction because respondent was at no time guilty of any unfair labor practice. Section 8 of the act denominates as such practice action by an employer to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights to organize, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, and to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, or 'by discrimination in regard to ... tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization. ...' There is no evidence and no finding that the respondent was guilty of any unfair labor practice in connection with the negotiations in New York. On the contrary, it affirmatively appears that the respondent was negotiating with the authorized representatives of the union. Nor was it an unfair labor practice to replace the striking employees with others in an effort to carry on the business. Although section 13 f the act, 29 U.S.C.A.  163, provides, 'Nothing in this Act (chapter) shall be construed so as to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to strike,' it does not follow that an employer, guilty of no act denounced by the statute, has lost the right to protect and continue his business by supplying places left vacant by strikers. And he is not bound to discharge those hired to fill the places of strikers, upon the election of the latter to resume their employ- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 333, 346]\n\u00a0\n ment, in order to create places for them. \n7\n The assurance by respondent to those who accepted employment during the strike that if they so desired their places might be permanent was not an unfair labor practice, nor was it such to reinstate only so many of the strikers as there were vacant places to be filled. But the claim put forward is that the unfair labor practice indulged by the respondent was discrimination in reinstating striking employees by keeping out certain of them for the sole reason that they had been active in the union. As we have said, the strikers retained, under the act, the status of employees. Any such discrimination in putting them back to work is, therefore, prohibiting by section 8.\n Fifth. The Board's findings as to discrimination are supported by evidence. We shall not attempt a discussion of the conflicting claims as to the proper conclusions to be drawn from the testimony. There was evidence, which the Board credited, that several of the five men in question were told that their union activities made them undesirable to their employer; and that some of them did not return to work with the great body of the men at 6 o'clock on Tuesday morning because they understood they would not be allowed to go to work until the superior officials had passed upon their applications. When they did apply at times between Tuesday morning and Thursday they were each told that the quota was full and that their applications could not be granted in any event until a vacancy occurred. This was on the ground that five of the eleven new men remained at work in San Francisco. On the other hand, six of the eleven strikers listed for separate treatment who reported for work early Tuesday morning, or within the next day or so, were permitted to go back to work and were not compelled to await the approval of their applications. It appears that all of the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 333, 347]\n\u00a0\n men who had been on strike signed applications for re-employment shortly after their resumption of work. The Board found, and we cannot say that its finding is unsupported, that, in taking back six of the eleven men and excluding five who were active union men, the respondent's officials discriminated against the latter on account of their union activities and that the excuse given that they did not apply until after the quota was full was an afterthought and not the true reason for the discrimination against them.\n As we have said, the respondent was not bound to displace men hired to take the strikers' places in order to provide positions for them. It might have refused reinstatement on the grounds of skill or ability, but the Board found that it did not do so. It might have resorted to any one of a number of methods of determining which of its striking employees would have to wait because five men had taken permanent positions during the strike, but it is found that the preparation and use of the list, and the action taken by respondent, was with the purpose to discriminate against those most active in the union. There is evidence to support these findings.\n Sixth. The Board's order does not violate the Fifth Amendment. The respondent insists that the relation of employer and employee ceased at the inception of the strike. The plain meaning of the act is that if men strike in connection with a current labor dispute their action is not to be construed as a renunciation of the employment relation and they remain employees for there medial purposes specified in the act. We have held that, in the exercise of the commerce power, Congress may impose upon contractual relationships reasonable regulations calculated to protect commerce against threatened industrial strife. National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, \n301 \nU.S. 1, 48\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 629, 108 A.L.R. 1352. The Board's order there sustained required the reinstatement of discharged employees. The \n\n[304 \nU.S. 333, 348]\n\u00a0\n requirement interfered with freedom of contract which the employer would have enjoyed except for the mandate of the statute. The provision of the act continuing the relationship of employer and employee in the case of a strike as a consequence of, or in connection with, a current labor dispute is a regulation of the same sort and within the principle of our decision.\n Seventh. The affirmative relief ordered by the Board was within its powers and its order was not arbitrary or capricious.\n As we have held in National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, Inc., \n303 \nU.S. 261\n, 58 S.Ct. 571, the relief which the statute empowers the Board to grant is to be adapted to the situation which calls for redress. On the basis of the findings, five men who took part in the strike were discriminated against in connection with a blanket offer to reinstate striking employees. The Board enjoined further discrimination against employees by reason of union affiliation, but it could not grant complete relief in respect of the five men short of ordering that the discrimination be neutralized by their being given their former positions and reimbursed for the loss due to their lack of employment consequent upon the respondent's discrimination. The order is criticized as arbitrary in that it is said to award back pay to date of reinstatement with deductions only for what was earned to the date of the order. We do not so read it, and the Board admits that credit must be given for all sums earned to date of reinstatement, and so construes the order. It is further said that the order arbitrarily and unreasonably requires the notices to be posted to state that respondent will not discharge its reinstated employees for any reason whatever. This clause of the order is inartificially drawn, and counsel for the Board admit that it should be read in connection with the remainder of the order forbidding discharge on the ground of union activity. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 333, 349]\n\u00a0\n Eighth. The respondent was not denied a hearing with respect to the offense found by the Board. The respondent says that it was summoned to answer a complaint that it discriminated by discharging the five men and that, after all the evidence was in, this complaint was withdrawn and a new one presented asserting that its refusal to re-employ the five men was the head and front of its offending. Then it is said that when the Board came to make its findings it reverted to the position that what the respondent did had not been a failure to employ but a wrongful discharge. Thus the respondent claims that it is found guilty of an unfair labor practice which was not within the issues upon which the case was tried. The position is highly technical. All parties to the proceeding knew from the outset that the thing complained of was discrimination against certain men by reason of their alleged union activities. If there was a current labor dispute the men were still employees by virtue of section 2(3), and the refusal to let them work was a discharge. The respondent says that as the Board failed to find, in so many words, that there was a current labor dispute its conclusion of fact that the men were discharged has no basis. But the Board found that the strike was called because the strikers were informed that the negotiations for a working agreement in New York were not proceeding satisfactorily. We think its action cannot be overturned for the mere reason that it failed to characterize the situation as a current labor dispute. The respondent further urgs that, when the amended complaint was filed and the original one withdrawn, the charge it had to meet was a refusal to re-employ; that the phrase 're-employ' means 'employ anew'; that if the Board had found a failure to employ the five men because of discrimination forbidden by the act, the findings would have followed the complaint, whereas the Board, in its conclusions of fact, referred to respondent's action as 'refusal to reinstate to \n\n[304 \nU.S. 333, 350]\n\u00a0\n employment' and as a discharge; and the argument is that the findings do not follow the pleadings.\n A review of the record shows that at no time during the hearings was there any misunderstanding as to what was the basis of the Board's complaint. The entire evidence, pro and con, was directed to the question whether, when the strike failed and the men desired to come back and were told that the strike would be forgotten and that they might come back in a body save for eleven men who were singled out for different treatment, six of whom, however, were treated like everyone else, the respondent did in fact discriminate against the remaining five because of union activity. While the respondent was entitled to know the basis of the complaint against it, and to explain its conduct, in an effort to meet that complaint, we find from the record that it understood the issue and was afforded full opportunity to justify the action of its officers as innocent rather than discriminatory.\n At the conclusion of the testimony, and prior to oral argument before the examiner, the Board transferred the proceeding to Washington to be further heard before the Board. It denied respondent's motion to resubmit the cause to the trial examiner with directions to prepare and file an intermediate report. In the Circuit Court of Appeals the respondent assigned error to this ruling. It appears that oral argument was had and a brief was filed with the Board after which it made its findings of fact and conclusions of law. The respondent now asserts that the failure of the Board to follow its usual practice of the submission of a tentative report by the trial examiner and a hearing on exceptions to that report deprived the respondent of opportunity to call to the Board's attention the alleged fatal variance between the allegations of the complaint and the Board's findings. What we have said sufficiently indicates that the issues and contentions of \n\n[304 \nU.S. 333, 351]\n\u00a0\n the parties were clearly defined and as no other detriment or disadvantage is claimed to have ensued from the Board's procedure the matter is not one calling for a reversal of the order. The Fifth Amendment guarantees no particular form of procedure; it protects substantial rights. Compare Morgan v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 468, 478\n, 56 S.Ct. 906, 910. The contention that the respondent was denied a full and adequate hearing must be rejected.\n Ninth. The other contentions of the respondent are overruled because foreclosed by earlier decisions of this court.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 9 Cir., 87 F.2d 611; 9 Cir., 92 F.2d 761. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 1 N.L.R.B. 201. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Jeffery-DeWitt Insulator Co. v.

PACIFIC GREYHOUND LINE(1938)\nNo. 504\nArgued: February 4, 1938Decided: February 28, 1938\n\n\n\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Charles Fahy, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Ivan Bowen, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondents. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 272, 273]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case, which comes here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, presents the same issues discussed in National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, Inc., \n303 \nU.S. 261\n, 58 S. Ct. 571, decided this day, but on a somewhat different state of facts. The only question requiring separate consideration is whether, in a case in which the National Labor Relations Board has ordered respondent to cease certain unfair labor practices, including the domination and financial support of a company union, the facts justify its further order that respondent withdraw all recognition of the union and give appropriate notice of the withdrawal to employees.\n The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit sustained the Board's findings and all of its order except the affirmative parts relating to withdrawal of recognition of the company union, which it set aside. 91 F. 2d 458. The authority conferred on the Board by section 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  160(c), to direct withdrawal of employer recognition when such an order will carry out the policies of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., was considered and sustained in the Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, Inc., Case, supra. The question calling for attention here is whether the facts found by the Board afford a basis for its conclusion that the policies of the Act will be effectuated by the present order.\n The findings show that respondent, an interstate carrier by motorbus, took an active and leading part in the organization in 1933 of the Drivers' Association, a labor organization of its employees; that respondent had since continuously interfered with and dominated the internal administration of the Association, and contributed to its support; that through such domination it had obtained a \n\n[303 \nU.S. 272, 274]\n\u00a0\n 'working agreement' with the Association in which it was stipulated that grievances of any employee should be presented first to his superior officer and then to respondent's president, whose decision should be final.\n Before the enactment of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A .  151 et seq., respondent twice made successful use of the Association as a means to forestall attempts to organize its employees, one in 1933 by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and another in 1934 by the employees themselves who sought to establish a Brotherhood of Motor Coach Operators. Respondent's officers were active in persuading, threatening and coercing employees to join or remain members of the Drivers' Association, and not to join the rival unions. In 1935, following the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, there was a renewed but unsuccessful attempt by respondent's employees to establish an organization affiliated with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen. The attempt was met by persuasions and warnings of respondent's employees, by its officers, not to join the new union, and by threats of discharge if they should join. The Board found that the respondent had engaged in unfair labor practices in violation of section 8(1, 2), 29 U.S. C.A.  158(1, 2), and ordered the cessation of these practices and withdrawal of respondent's recognition of the Drivers' Association.\n While the formal provisions, in constitution and by-laws, for insuring employer control of the company union in the Pennsylvania Case are wanting here, the record shows, as the Board found, that employer control of the Drivers' Association was none the less effective. During a period of three years it had been successfully used by respondent as an instrument for preventing three successive attempts for the organization by respondent's employees of a union free from company domination. In \n\n[303 \nU.S. 272, 275]\n\u00a0\n ordering withdrawal of recognition of the Drivers' Association by respondent, the Board pointed out that a mere order to cease the unfair labor practices 'would not set free the employee's impulse to seek the organization which would most effectively represent him'; that continued recognition of the Drivers' Association would provide respondent 'with a device by which its power may now be made effective unobtrusively, almost without further action on its part. Even though he would not have freely chosen' the Association 'as an initial proposition, the employee, once having chosen, may by force of a timorous habit, be held firm to his choice. The employee must be released from these compulsions.'\n Whether the continued recognition of the Drivers' Association by respondent would be a continuing obstacle to the exercise of the employees' right of self-organization and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, was an inference of fact which the Board could draw if there was evidence to support it. Section 10(e), 29 U. S.C.A.  160(e); see Swayne & Hoyt, Ltd., v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 297\n, 57 S.Ct. 478. We cannot say that the Board's conclusion was without support in the evidence and in the subsidiary findings which respondent does not challenge.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD v. PENNSYLVANIA GREYHOUND LINES(1938)\nNo. 413\nArgued: February 4, 1938Decided: February 28, 1938\n\n\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 261, 262]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Charles Fahy, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Ivan Bowen, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The main question for decision is whether, upon a finding that an employer has created and fostered a labor organization of employees and dominated its administration in violation of section 8(1, 2) of the National Labor Relations Act of July 5, 1935, c. 372, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S. C.  151, et seq., the National Labor Relations Board, in addition to ordering the employer to cease these practices, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 261, 263]\n\u00a0\n can require him to withdraw all recognition of the organization as the representative of its employees and to post notices informing them of such withdrawal.\n Respondent Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, Inc., is a corporation operating a passenger motorbus system between the Atlantic Coast and Chicago and St. Louis. Respondent Greyhound Management Company, an affiliate of the Pennsylvania Company, performs various services relating to employee personnel of the latter and its affiliated corporations. Together, respondents act as employers of those employees working at the Pittsburgh Garage of the Pennsylvania Company and together actively deal with labor relations of those employees.\n Upon charges filed by Local Division No. 1063, Amalgamated Association of Street, Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America, a labor organization, the Board issued its complaint, as permitted by section 10(b) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  160(b), charging that respondents had engaged in specified unfair labor practices affecting interstate commerce, in violation of section 8, 29 U.S.C.A.  158. After notice to respondents, and hearing, the Board found that they had engaged in unfair labor practices by interfering with, restraining, and coercing employees in the exercise of their rights, guaranteed by section 7, 29 U.S. C.A.  157, in that they had dominated and interfered with the formation and administration of a labor organization of their employees, employees Association of the Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, Inc., and had contributed financial and other support to it in violation of section 8(1), (2), 29 U. S.C.A.  158(1, 2).\n The Board ordered that respondents cease each of the specified unfair labor practices. It further ordered that they withdraw recognition from the Employees Association as employee representative authorized to deal with respondents concerning grievances, terms of employment, and labor disputes, and that they post conspicuous notices in all the places of business where such employees are en- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 261, 264]\n\u00a0\n gaged, stating that the 'Association is so disestablished and that respondents will refrain from any such recognition thereof.' 1 N.L.R.B. 1.\n Upon the Board's petition under section 10(e), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(e), to enforce the order, heard April 1, 1936, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit gave judgment after a delay of one year and two months, during which there were three postponements and two rearguments. It struck from the order all provisions requiring the withdrawal by respondents of recognition of the Employees Association and publication of notice of withdrawal, and directed that in other respects the Board's order be enforced. 3 Cir., 91 F.2d 178. The court thought that the Board was without authority to order the employers to withhold recognition from the Association, without notice to it and opportunity for a hearing, and without an election by the employees to choose a labor organization to represent them. We granted certiorari, \n302 \nU.S. 676\n, 58 S.Ct. 139, 82 L.Ed . --, the questions involved being of importance in the administration of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq.\n Respondents do not assail the Board's findings of fact as without support in the evidence, and the principal questions for decision are of law, whether in the circumstances disclosed by the findings the Board acted within the authority conferred upon it by sections 7, 8, and 10 of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  157, 158, 160.\n Section 7 provides: 'Employees shall have the right to self- organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.'\n Section 8 declares:\n'It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer-\n\n'(1) To interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7 (section 157 of this title). \n\n[303 \nU.S. 261, 265]\n\u00a0\n '(2) To dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute financial or other support to it.'\n\n By section 10(b), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(b) the Board is given authority to hear complaints of unfair labor practices upon evidence; and section 10( c)1 directs that when the Board finds that any person has engaged in unfair labor practices it 'shall issue and cause to be served on such person an order requiring such person to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action ... as will effectuate the policies of this Act (chapter).'\n Notwithstanding the mandatory form of section 10(c), its provisions in substance lease to the Board some scope for the exercise of judgment and discretion in determining, upon the basis of the findings, whether the case is one requiring an affirmative order, and in choosing the particular affirmative relief to be ordered. Hence, upon the challenge of the affirmative part of an order of the Board, we look to the Act itself, read in the light of its history, to ascertain its policy, and to the facts which the Board has found, to see whether they afford a basis for its judgment that the action ordered is an appropriate means of carrying out that policy.\n The history of the Act and its language show that its ruling purpose was to protect interstate commerce by \n\n[303 \nU.S. 261, 266]\n\u00a0\n securing to employees the rights established by section 7, 29 U.S.C.A.  157, to organize, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in concerted activities for that and other purposes. National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1, 23\n, 33 S., 57 S.Ct. 615, 617, 622, 108 A.L.R. 1352. This appears both from the formal declaration of policy in  1 of the Act, National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., supra, \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, at pages 22-24, 57 S.Ct. 615, 617, 108 A.L.R. 1352, and from section 7, in itself a declaration of the policy which, in conjunction with section 10(c), it adopts as the controlling guide to administrative action.\n Before enactment of the National Labor Relations Act this Court had recognized that the maintenance of a 'company union,' dominated by the employer, may be a ready and effective means of obstructing self- organization of employees and their choice of their own representatives for the purpose of collective bargaining. Section 2(3) of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 577, had provided that representatives, for the purposes of the Act, should be designated by employer and employees 'without interference, influence, or coercion exercised by either party over the self-organization or designation of representatives by the other.' We had held that in enforcing this provision, employer recognition of a company union might be enjoined and the union 'disestablished,' as an appropriate means of preventing interference with the rights secured to employees by the statute. Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway & Steamship Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 560\n, 50 S.Ct. 427, 430; see, also, Virginian Railway Co. v. System Federation No. 40, \n300 \nU.S. 515\n, 542 et seq., 57 S.Ct. 592, 596.\n Congress, in enacting the National Labor Relations Act, had in mind the experience in the administration of the Railway Labor Act, and declared that the former was 'an amplification and further clarification of the principles' of the latter. Report of the House Committee on \n\n[303 \nU.S. 261, 267]\n\u00a0\n Labor, H.R. 1147, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 3. It had before it the Railway Clerks Case which had emphasized the importance of union recognition in securing collective bargaining, Report of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, S.Rep. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 17, and there were then available data showing that once an employer has conferred recognition on a particular organization it has a marked advantage over any other in securing the adherence of employees, and hence in preventing the recognition of any other. \n2\n The National Labor Relations Act continued and amplified the policy of the Railway Labor Act by its declaration in section 7, 29 U.S.C.A.  157, and by providing generally in section 8, 29 U.S.C.A.  158, that any interferences in the exercise of the rights guaranteed by section 7 and specifically the domination or interference with the formation or administration of any labor organization were unfair labor practices. To secure to employees the benefits of self-organization and collective bargaining through representatives of the employees' own choosing, the Board was authorized by section 10(c), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(c), to order the abandonment of unfair labor practices and to take affirmative action which would carry out the policy of the Act.\n In recommending the adoption of this latter provision the Senate Committee called attention to the decree which, in the Railway Clerks Case, had compelled the employer to 'diseastablish its company union as representative of its employees.' Report of the Senate Committee \n\n[303 \nU.S. 261, 268]\n\u00a0\n on Education and Labor, supra. The report of the House Committee on Labor on this feature of the Act, after pointing out that collective bargaining is 'a sham when the employer sits on both sides of the table by supporting a particular organization with which he deals,' declared: 'The orders will of course be adopted to the need of the individual case; they may include such matters as refraining from collective bargaining with a minority group, recognition of the agency chosen by the majority for the purposes of collective bargaining, posting of appropriate bulletins, refraining from bargaining with an organization corrupted by unfair labor practices.' Report of the House Committee on Labor, supra, pp. 18, 24.\n It is plain that the challenged provisions of the present order are of a kind contemplated by Congress in the enactment of section 10(c) and are within its terms. There remains the question whether the findings adequately support them.\n The Board's subsidiary findings of fact fully sustain its conclusion that respondents had engaged in unfair labor practices, by active participation in the organization and administration of the Employees Association, which they dominated throughout its history, and to whose financial support they had contributed; and that they had interfered with, restrained and coerced their employees in the exercise of the rights confirmed by section 7 to form to themselves a labor organization and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing.\n It is unnecessary to repeat in full detail the facts disclosed by the findings. They show that before the enactment of the National Labor Relations Act, respondents, whose employees were unorganized, initiated a project for their organization under company domination. In the course of its execution officers or other representatives of respondent were active in promoting the plan, in \n\n[303 \nU.S. 261, 269]\n\u00a0\n urging employees to join, in the preparation of the details of organization, including the by-laws, in presiding over organization meetings, and in selecting employee representatives of the organization.\n The by-laws and regulations provided that all motorbus operators, maintenance men and clerical employees, after three months service, automatically became members of the Association, and that only employees were eligible to act as employee representatives. No provisions were made for meetings of members, nor was a procedure established whereby employees might instruct their representatives, or whereby those representatives might disseminate information or reports. Grievances were to be taken up with regional committees with final review by a Joint Reviewing Committee made up of an equal number of regional chairmen and of menagement representatives, but review in those cases could not be secured unless there was a joint submission of the controversy by employee and management representatives. Change of the by-laws without employer consent was precluded by a provision that amendment should be only on a two-thirds vote of the Joint Reviewing Committee, composed of equal numbers of employer and employee representatives. Employees paid no dues, all the Association expenses being borne by the management.\n Although the Association was in terms created as a bargaining agency for the purpose of 'providing adequate representation' for respondents' employees by 'securing for them satisfactory adjustment of all controversial matters,' it has functioned only to settle individual grievances. On the one recorded occasion when the employees sought a wage increase, the company representatives prevented its consideration by refusing to join in the submission to the Joint Reviewing Committee.\n In May, 1935, shortly before the passage of the Act, certain of respondents' Pittsburgh employees organized a local union, Local Division No. 1063 of the Amalga- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 261, 270]\n\u00a0\n mated Association of Street, Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America, affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, and continued to hold meetings of the organization after the passage of the Act on July 5, 1935, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq. Before and after that date, respondents' officers were active in warning employees against joining the union and in threatening them with discharge if they should join and in keeping the union meetings under surveillance.\n Section 10(e), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(e) declares that the Board's findings of fact 'if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive.' Whether the continued recognition of the Employees Association by respondents would in itself be a continuing obstacle to the exercise of the employees' right of sell-organization and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, is an inference of fact to be drawn by the Board from the evidence reviewed in its subsidiary findings. See Swayne & Hoyt, Ltd. v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 297\n, 57 S.Ct. 478.\n We may assume that there are situations in which the Board would not be warranted in concluding that there was any occasion for withdrawal of employer recognition of an existing union before an election by employees under section 9(c), 29 U.S.C.A.  159(c), even though it had ordered the employer to cease unfair labor practices. But here respondents, by unfair labor practices, have succeeded in establishing a company union so organized that it is incapable of functioning as a bargaining representative of employees. With no procedure for meetings of members or for instructing employee representatives, and with no power to bring grievances before the Joint Reviewing Committee without employer consent, the Association could not without amendment of its by-laws be used as a means of the collective bargaining contemplated by section 7; and amendment could not be had without the employer's approval. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 261, 271]\n\u00a0\n In view of all the circumstances the Board could have thought that continued recognition of the Association would serve as a means of thwarting the policy of collective bargaining by enabling the employer to induce adherence of employees to the Association in the mistaken belief that it was truly representative and afforded an agency for collective bargaining, and thus to prevent self-organization. The inferences to be drawn were for the Board and not the courts. Swayne & Hoyt, Ltd. v. United States, supra. There was ample basis for its conclusion that withdrawal of recognition of the Association by respondents, accompanied by suitable publicity, was an appropriate way to give effect to the policy of the Act.\n As the order did not run against the Association it is not entitled to notice and hearing. Its presence was not necessary in order to enable the Board to determine whether respondents had violated the statute or to make an appropriate order against them. See General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & M.S.R. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 261, 285\n, 286 S., 43 S.Ct. 106, 116.\n Respondents suggest that the case has become moot by reason of the fact that since the Board made its order it has certified the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen as representative of the motorbus drivers of the Pennsylvania company for purposes of collective bargaining and that in a pending proceeding under section 9(c) for the certification of a representative of the other Pittsburgh employees, to which the Employees' Association is not a party, the Pennsylvania company and Local Division No. 1063, who are parties, have made no objection to the proposed certification. But an order of the character made by the Board, lawful when made, does not become moot because it is obeyed or because changing circumstances indicate that the need for it may be less than when made. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 261, 272]\n\u00a0\n We have considered but find it unnecessary to comment upon other objections to the order, of less moment.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 10(c).

Since 1918 it has issued noncancelable health and accident policies. The Insurance Commissioner of California determined that, while the life and general health and accident business was in sound condition, there was an over-all deficit in reserves due to the unprofitable nature of outstanding noncancelable health and accident risks, with the result that the company was insolvent within the meaning of the Code. July 22, 1936, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, on his application, appointed him conservator. On the same day he applied for and obtained an order which appointed him liquidator of the company. On the same day, as conservator, he petitioned for authority to rehabilitate \n\n[305 \nU.S. 297, 300]\n\u00a0\n the company and submitted a plan embodying an agreement, to be executed by the company and himself as Commissioner, with a new corporation, which he would form, all of whose capital stock he would purchase with the assets of the company, and to which he would transfer most of the assets, retaining the stock of the new company and certain other assets of the old. The new company was to assume the policies and obligations of the old company to the extent provided in the agreement. Policy holders were to have the option of taking insurance from the new company or proving their claims for breach of their contracts, provision for payment being made by covenants of the new company and the retained assets of the old. The court approved the plan and authorized the execution and performance of the agreement.\n Shortly afterwards it was discovered that the judge who acted in the cause was probably disqualified by ownership of a policy issued by the company. August 11, 1936, another judge entered an order, which, after adverting to the possible disqualification of the judge who made the earlier orders, ratified, approved, and confirmed the order appointing the Commissioner conservator and, on the basis of the petition filed on July 22, independently, and as an original order, appointed the Commissioner conservator, invested him with title to all the company's assets, and authorized him to endeavor to consummate a rehabilitation or reinsurance plan. On September 25 the Commissioner presented a further petition for approval of the rehabilitation and reinsurance agreement, which recited his actions taken pursuant to the court's orders and to the plan of rehabilitation, and asked approval thereof. An order issued which directed all interested persons to show cause why the agreement, and what had been done pursuant to it, should not be approved and all the prior acts of the Commissioner ratified and confirmed, and fixed a hearing. At the hear- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 297, 301]\n\u00a0\n ing, which lasted from November 19 to December 4, many officers, stockholders and policy holders who had intervened, including the petitioners, were heard. Plans of rehabilitation presented by some of them were considered; evidence was taken and argument was had. December 4 an order was entered approving the Commissioner's plan and agreement, ratifying the action he had taken, and authorizing him as conservator, and as liquidator, if he should be appointed as such, to carry out the rehabilitation agreement. The court retained jurisdiction to make further orders for the effectuation of the plan and agreement.\n The Supreme Court of California affirmed the order. \n3\n The action of that court in overruling certain of petitioners' contentions is claimed to have deprived them of their property without due process.\n The Court declared that the orders of July 22, 1936, were void because of the disqualification of the judge who made them. The petitioners argue that in consequence the Commissioner's transfer of assets to a new company pursuant to the approved plan was void and that its illegality could not be cured by subsequent court action. The Supreme Court held, however, that the court in which the Commissioner's original petition was filed thereby acquired jurisdiction and that the avoidance of the orders made by the disqualification of the judge who entered them did not disenable a qualified judge thereafter from entering valid orders based on the petition. It is further urged that as the old company's assets were transferred to the new pursuant to a void order there was nothing on which any later order could operate. The later order, which is the subject of review, ratified and confirmed the transfer, and the Supreme Court held the order affective under the Insurance Code. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 297, 302]\n\u00a0\n It is said that the Code does not authorize the Commissioner to delegate to a corporation organized by him powers and duties in aid of his administration of the assets of an insolvent insurance company. The state court has held such procedure is in accordance with the Code provisions.\n It is argued that the authority which the Code confers on the Commissioner to enter into rehabilitation or reinsurance agreements does not embrace a contract for assumption of the insolvent company's policies by a new company organized by the Commissioner. The court below held the provisions of the statute contemplated such action.\n It is claimed that the Commissioner's action violated certain state statutes concerning fraudulent conveyances. The state court held the contrary.\n All of these holdings concern matters of state law and amount at most to alleged erroneous constructions of the State's statutes by its own court of last resort. Such decisions would not be a denial of the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A. Const. amend. 14. 4 We are, therefore, without jurisdiction to review the state court's decision of any of those questions.\n It is argued that the Code unconstitutionally delegates legislative functions to the Commissioner, and that the Supreme Court erred in not so holding. This, again, is a question of state law the decision of which by the State's highest court is binding upon us. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The Insurance Code provides: 'In any proceeding under this article, the commissioner, as conservator ... \n\n[305 \nU.S. 297, 303]\n\u00a0\n may, subject to the approval of said court, ... mutualize or reinsure the business of' an insurance company 'or enter into rehabilitation agreements.' Section 1043, p. 547. The petitioners assert that this language is so vague that no one can determine what powers are intended to be conferred upon the Commissioner and that the state courts, in construing the Code to authorize the plan and procedure here in question unconstitutionally attempted to read a meaning into the statute of which it is not susceptible, and thus deprived the petitioners of their property without due process. The court below fully considered the contention and overruled it. We think its decision was justified by the criteria approved by this court. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioners unsuccessfully claimed in the Supreme Court that the method of liquidation adopted by the Commissioner and approved by the court, even if authorized by the Insurance Code, denies them due process and impairs the obligation of their policy contracts. Because of these contentions we granted certiorari.\n One of the petitioners holds a life policy which, if he assents to the plan, will be replaced by a policy of the new company for the same amount. The others are holders of noncenacelable health and accident policies no liability under which has accrued. If they assent to the plan and accept the obligation of the new company, in lieu of that of the old, they will receive insurance for only a percentage of the face value of their old policies. The alternative open to all is to dissent from the plan and to prove their claims for breach of their policy contracts against the liquidator of the old company. They insist this option is not available to them as no liquidator has been appointed. When they took their appeal to the State Supreme Court, there was pending an application for the appointment of the Commissioner as liquidator, \n\n[305 \nU.S. 297, 304]\n\u00a0\n and no reason is assigned why action cannot be taken upon this petition pursuant to the plan. The Supreme Court has said: 'The proposal contemplates that in due course the commissioner will be appointed liquidator of the old company, and in that capacity will receive, liquidate, and pay all claims against the old company from the old company's assets not transferred to the new company (including the new company's stock), and from certain moneys furnished to the liquidator by the new company as provided in the agreement.' 74 P.2d 771. The petitioners assert that the funds provided will be insufficient for the payment of their claims and others of like character, should they dissent from the plan. The order of the Superior Court recites that the plan makes adequate provision for each class of policy holders, for the creditors, and for the stockholders; that the plan is fair and equitable; that it does not discriminate unfairly or illegally in favor of any class of policy holders; that the intangible assets conserved by the plan are worth several million dollars and that if the old company were dissolved and its assets sold their value would be substantially less than the amount which will be realized from them under the plan.\n The record upon which the appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the State, and which has been brought here by our writ, contains only the judgment roll. The evidence is not before us and the court below has held that, under the state law, the judge was not bound to make special findings. We must presume that there was substantial evidence to sustain the court's decree. On account of the state of the record the petitioners are unable to point to any evidence to sustain their contention that if they dissent they will not receive as much in liquidation of their claims for breach of their policy contracts as they would upon a sale of assets and distribution of the proceeds. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 297, 305]\n\u00a0\n The petitioners have no constitutional right to a particular form of remedy. 7 They are not entitled, as against their fellows who prefer to come under the plan and accept its benefits, to force, at their own wish or whim, a liquidation which under the findings will not advantage them and may seriously injure those who accept the benefit of the plan. They are not bound, as were the dissenting creditors in Doty v. Love, \n295 \nU.S. 64\n, 55 S.Ct. 558, 96 A.L.R. 1438, to accept the obligation of the new company but are afforded an alternative whereby they will receive damages for breach of their contracts. They have failed to show that the plan takes their property without due process.\n It is not contended that a statutory scheme for the liquidation of an insolvent domestic corporation is per se an impairment of the obligation of the company's contracts. The argument is that the impairment of contract arises from the less favorable terms and conditions of the new noncancelable policies which are to be substituted for the old ones and, in the case of the life policies, by the substitution of a new company as contractor in place of the old, without the consent of the policy holder. This position is bottomed upon the theory that the policy holders are compelled to accept the new company as insurer on the terms set out in the rehabilitation agreement. As has been pointed out, they are not so compelled but are given the option of a liquidation which on this record appears as favorable to them as that which would result from the sale of the assets and pro rata distribution in solution of all resulting claims for breach of outstanding policies.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Statutes 1935, Chap. 145, pp. 540-553.

Coulter Wells, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 552, 554]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The matter in controversy is whether the case made by the pleadings involves or grows out of a labor dispute within the meaning of section 13 of the Norris-La Guardia Act. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The respondent, by bill filed in the District Court of the District of Columbia, sought an injunction restraining the petitioners and their agents from picketing its stores and engaging in other activities injurious to its business. The petitioners answered, the cause was heard upon bill and answer, and an injunction was awarded. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the decree. \n2\n The importance of the question presented and asserted conflict with the decisions of this and other federal courts moved us to grant certiorari. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 552, 555]\n\u00a0\n As the case was heard upon the bill and a verified answer, the facts upon which decision must rest are those set forth in the bill and admitted or not denied by the answer and those affirmatively set up in the answer.\n The following facts alleged in the bill are admitted by the answer: Respondent, a Delaware corporation, operates 255 retail grocery, meat, and vegetable stores, a warehouse and a bakery in the District of Columbia, and employs both white and colored persons. April 3, 1936, it opened a new store at 1936 Eleventh Street N.W., installing personnel having an acquaintance with the trade in the vicinity. Petitioner, the New Negro Alliance, is a corporation composed of colored persons, organized for the mutual improvement of its members and the promotion of civic, educational, benevolent, and charitable enterprises. The individual petitioners are officers of the corporation. The relation of employer and employees does not exist between the respondent and the petitioners or any of them. The petitioners are not engaged in any business competitive with that of the respondent, and the officers, members, or representatives of the Alliance are not engaged in the same business or occupation as the respondent or its employees.\n As to other matters of fact, the state of the pleadings may be briefly summarized. The bill asserts: The petitioners have made arbitrary and summary demands upon the respondent that it engage and employ colored persons in managerial and sales positions in the new store and in various other stores; it is essential to the conduct of the business that respondent employ experienced persons in its stores and compliance with the arbitrary demands of defendants would involve the discharge of white employees and their replacement with colored; it is imperative that respondent be free in the selection and control of persons employed by it without interference by the petitioners \n\n[303 \nU.S. 552, 556]\n\u00a0\n or others; petitioners have written respondent letters threatening boycott and ruination of its business and notices that by means of announcements, meetings, and advertising the petitioners will circulate statements that respondent is unfair to colored people and to the colored race and, contrary to fact, that respondent does not employ colored persons; respondent has not acceded to these demands. The answer admits the respondent has not acceded to the petitioners' demands, but denies the other allegations and states that the Alliance and its agents have requested only that respondent, in the regular course of personnel changes in its retail stores, give employment to negroes as clerks, particularly in stores patronized largely by colored people; that the petitioners have not requested the discharge of white employees nor sought action which would involve their discharge. It denies the making of the threats described and alleges the only representations threatened by the Alliance or its authorized agents are true representations that named stores of the respondent do not employ negroes as sales persons and that the petitioners have threatened no more than the use of lawful and peaceable persuasion of members of the community to withhold patronage from particular stores after the respondent's refusal to acknowledge petitioner's requests that it adopt a policy of employing negro clerks in such stores in the regular course of personnel changes.\n The bill further alleges that the petitioners and their authorized representatives 'have unlawfully conspired with each other to picket, patrol, boycott, and ruin the Plaintiff's business in said stores, and particularly in the store located at 1936 Eleventh Street, Northwest' and, 'in an effort to fulfill their threats of coercion and intimidation, actually have caused the said store to be picketed or patrolled during hours of business of the plaintiff, by their members, representatives, officers, agents, servants, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 552, 557]\n\u00a0\n and employees'; the pickets carrying large placards charging respondent with being unfair to negroes and reading, 'Do your Part! Buy Where You Can Work! No Negroes Employed Here!' for the purpose of intimidating and coercing prospective customers from entering the respondent's store until the respondent accedes to the petitioners' demands. 'Said defendants, their pickets or patrols or some of them have jostled and collided with persons in front of the said store and have physically hindered, obstructed, interfered with, delayed, molested, and harassed persons desiring to enter the place of business of the Plaintiff Corporation; said pickets, or some of them, have attempted to dissuade and prevent persons from entering plaintiff's place of business; said defendants, their pickets or patrols are disorderly while picketing or patrolling, and attract crowds to gather in front of said store, and encourage the crowds or members thereof to become disorderly, and to harass, and otherwise annoy, interfere with and attempt to dissuade, and to prevent persons from entering the place of business of the plaintiff, the disorder thereby preventing the proper conduct of and operation of the plaintiff's business. Defendants have threatened to use similar tactics of picketing and patrolling as aforesaid in front of the several other stores of the plaintiff.' Four photographs alleged to portray the picketing are annexed as exhibits to the bill. One of them shows a man carrying a sandwich placard on the sidewalk and no one else within the range of the camera. In another two children are seen beside the picket; in another two adults; in the fourth, one adult entering respondent's store at a distance from the picket and without apparent interference. The answer denies all these allegations save that it admits the petitioners did, during April 4, 1936, and at no other time, cause the store at 1936 Eleventh Street N.W. to be continuously picketed by a single person carrying a placard exhibiting \n\n[303 \nU.S. 552, 558]\n\u00a0\n the words quoted by the bill; and the petitioners, prior to the acts complained of in the bill, picketed, or expressed the intention of picketing, two other stores. It admits that the photographs correctly represent the picketing of April 4, 1936. The answer avers the information carried on the placards was true, was not intended to, and did not in fact, intimidate customers; there was no physical obstruction, interference, or harassment of any one desiring to enter the store; there was no disorderly conduct; and the picketing did not cause or encourage crowds to gather in front of the store.\n The bill states: 'As evidence of the widespread and concerted action planned by the Defendants herein, they have caused to be placed or have permitted to appear in the Washington Tribune ... the following statements. ...' There follow quotations from articles appearing in the newspaper purporting to report meetings of the Alliance and speeches made thereat. There is no statement that the facts reported in the articles are true. The answer denies that any of the petitioners is connected with or exercises any control over the Washington Tribune or caused or permitted that newspaper to publish any article or news item whatsoever or in any way acted in concert with the newspaper in those publications.\n The bill asserts that petitioners and their representatives, officers, and agents, unlawfully conspired to picket, boycott, and ruin the respondent's business in its stores, particularly the store at 1936 Eleventh street. This is denied by the answer.\n The bill says that the described conduct of petitioners will continue until respondent complies with petitioners' demands; is and will continue to be dangerous to the life and health of persons on the highway, to property thereon, and to respondent's employees, its property, and business, and will cause respondent irreparable injury; the petitioners' acts are unlawful, constitute a conspiracy in \n\n[303 \nU.S. 552, 559]\n\u00a0\n restraint of trade, and, if continued, will ruin the respondent's business. The answer denies these allegations so far as they constitute assertions of fact.\n The case, then, as it stood for judgment, was this: The petitioners requested the respondent to adopt a policy of employing negro clerks in certain of its stores in the course of personnel changes; the respondent ignored the request and the petitioners caused one person to patrol in front of one of the respondent's stores on one day carrying a placard which said, 'Do Your Part! Buy Where You Can Work! No Negroes Employed Here!' and caused or threatened a similar patrol of two other stores of respondent. The information borne by the placard was true. The patrolling did not coerce or intimidate respondent's customers; did not physically obstruct, interfere with, or harass persons desiring to enter the store; the picket acted in an orderly manner, and his conduct did not cause crowds to gather in front of the store.\n The trial judge was of the view that the laws relating to labor disputes had no application to the case. He entered a decree enjoining the petitioners and their agents and employees from picketing or patrolling any of the respondent's stores, boycotting or urging others to boycott respondent; restraining them, whether by inducements, threats, intimidation, or actual or threatened physical force, from hindering any person entering respondent's places of business, from destroying or damaging or threatening to destroy or damage respondent's property, and from aiding or abetting others in doing any of the prohibited things. The Court of Appeals thought that the dispute was not a labor dispute within the Norris-La Guardia Act because it did not involve terms and conditions of employment such as wages, hours, unionization or betterment of working conditions, and that the trial court, therefore, had jurisdiction to issue the injunction. We think the conclusion that the dispute was not a labor dispute \n\n[303 \nU.S. 552, 560]\n\u00a0\n within the meaning of the act, because it did not involve terms and conditions of employment in the sense of wages, hours, unionization or betterment of working conditions is erroneous.\n Subsection (a) of section 13 provides: 'A case shall be held to involve or to grow out of a labor dispute when the case involves persons who are engaged in the same industry, trade, craft, or occupation; or have direct or indirect interests therein; ... or when the case involves any conflicting or competing interests in a 'labor dispute' (as hereinafter defined) of 'persons participating or interested' therein (as hereinafter defined).' Subsection (b) characterizes a person or association as participating or interested in a labor dispute 'if relief is sought against him or it, and if he or it ... has a direct or indirect interest therein.' Subsection (c) defines the term 'labor dispute' as including 'any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment, ... regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employe.' These definitions plainly embrace the controversy which gave rise to the instant suit and classify it as one arising out of a dispute defined as a labor dispute. They leave no doubt that the New Negro Alliance and the individual petitioners are, in contemplation of the act, persons interested in the dispute. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n In quoting the clauses of section 13 we have omitted those that deal with disputes between employers and employees and disputes between associations of persons engaged in a particular trade or craft, and employers in the same industry. It is to be noted, however, that the inclusion in the definitions of such disputes, and the persons interested in them, serves to emphasize the fact that the quoted portions were intended to embrace contro- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 552, 561]\n\u00a0\n versies other than those between employers and employees; between labor unions seeking to represent employees and employers; and between persons seeking employment and employers.\n The act does not concern itself with the background or the motives of the dispute. The desire for fair and equitable conditions of employment on the part of persons of any race, color, or persuasion, and the removal of discriminations against them by reason of their race or religious beliefs is quite as important to those concerned as fairness and equity in terms and conditions of employment can be to trade or craft unions or any form of labor organization or association. Race discrimination by an employer may reasonably be deemed more unfair and less excusable than discrimination against workers on the ground of union affiliation. There is no justification in the apparent purposes or the express terms of the act for limiting its definition of labor disputes and cases arising therefrom by excluding those which arise with respect to discrimination in terms and conditions of employment based upon differences of race or color.\n The purpose and policy of the act respecting the jurisdiction of the federal courts is set forth in sections 4 and 7. The former deprives those courts of jurisdiction to issue an injunction against, inter alia, giving publicity to the existence of, or the facts involved in, any labor dispute, whether by advertising, speaking, patrolling, or by any other method not involving fraud or violence; against assembling peaceably to act or to organize to act in promotion of their interests in a labor dispute; against advising or notifying any person of an intention to do any of the acts specified; against agreeing with other persons to do any of the acts specified. \n4\n Section 7 deprives the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 552, 562]\n\u00a0\n courts of jurisdiction to issue an injunction in any case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, except after hearing sworn testimony in open court in support of the allegations of the complaint, and upon findings of fact to the effect (a) that unlawful acts have been threatened and will be committed unless restrained, or have been committed and will be continued, unless restrained, and then only against the person or persons, association or organization making the threat or permitting the unlawful act or authorizing or ratifying it; (b) that substantial and irreparable injury to complainant's property will follow; (c) that, as to each item of relief granted, greater injury will be inflicted upon the complainant by denial of the relief than will be inflicted on the defendant by granting it; (d) that complainant has no adequate remedy at law; and (e) that the public officers charged with the duty to protect complainant's property are unable or unwilling to furnish adequate protection. \n 5\n\u00a0\n\n The legislative history of the act demonstrates that it was the purpose of the Congress further to extend the prohibitions of the Clayton Act6 respecting the exercise of jurisdiction by federal courts and to obviate the results of the judicial construction of that act. \n7\n It was intended that peaceful and orderly dissemination of information by those defined as persons interested in a labor dispute concerning 'terms and conditions of employment' in an industry or a plant or a place of business should be lawful; that, short of fraud, breach of the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 552, 563]\n\u00a0\n peace, violence, or conduct otherwise unlawful, those having a direct or indirect interest in such terms and conditions of employment should be at liberty to advertise and disseminate facts and information with respect to terms and conditions of employment, and peacefully to persuade others to concur in their views respecting an employer's practices. \n8\n The District Court erred in not complying with the provisions of the act.\n The decree must be reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS (dissenting).\n Mr. Justice BUTLER and I cannot accept the view that a 'labor dispute' emerges whenever an employer fails to respond to a communication from A, B, and C-irrespective of their race, character, reputation, fitness, previous or present employment-suggesting displeasure because of his choice of employees and their expectation that in the future he will not fail to select men of their complexion.\n It seems unbelievable that, in all such circumstances, Congress intended to inhibit courts from extending protection long guaranteed by law and thus, in effect, encourage mobbish interference with the individual's liberty of action. Under the tortured meaning now attributed to the words 'labor dispute,' no employer-merchant, manufacturer, builder, cobbler, housekeeper or whatnot-who \n\n[303 \nU.S. 552, 564]\n\u00a0\n prefers helpers of one color or class can find adequate safeguard against intolerable violations of his freedom if members of some other class, religion, race, or color demand that he give them precedence. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Design thus to promote strife, encourage trespass, and stimulate intimidation, ought not to be admitted where, as here, not plainly avowed. The ultimate result of the view now approved to the very people whom present petitioners claim to represent, it may be, is prefigured by the grievous plight of minorities in lands where the law has become a mere political instrument. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act March 23, 1932, c. 90, 47 Stat. 70, 73, U.S.C., tit. 29,  113, 29 U.S.C.A.  113. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 67 App.D.C. 359, 92 F.2d 510, 65 W.L.R. 874. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Compare Senn v.

Petitioner had insured his life by a policy on which it agreed to pay his executors $10,000 upon proof of death without regard to its cause, or $20,000 in case of death resulting from accident as defined by a provision the pertinent parts of which follow: 'The Double Indemnity ... shall be payable upon receipt of due proof that the death of the Insured resulted directly and independently of all other causes from bodily injury effected solely through external, violent and accidental means ... Double Indemnity shall not be payable if the Insured's death resulted from self-destruction, whether sane or insane.'\n Respondent sued petitioner in a state court for $20,000. There being diversity of citizenship, defendant removed the case to the federal court for the District of Montana. The complaint alleges that the death of the insured resulted directly and independently of all other causes from bodily injury effected solely through external, violent, and accidental means and did not result from self-destruction but directly from the accidental discharge of a rifle. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 161, 166]\n\u00a0\n Defendant's answer concedes that plaintiff is entitled to the face of the policy, and alleges a deposit of that amount with interest in court. It denies that death resulted from bodily injury effected through accidental means; and specifically denies that it resulted from the accidental discharge of a rifle or other firearm. And 'as an affirmative defense,' it alleges that the death of the insured resulted from self- destruction by intentionally discharging a loaded rifle into his body with intent to take his life.\n The case came on for trial and, at the close of the evidence, the judge on motion of defendant directed the jury to return a verdict in its favor. Plaintiff appealed; the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the question whether the death was accidental should have been submitted to the jury, and reversed the judgment. 9 Cir., 76 F.2d 543. At the second trial plaintiff went forward; at the close of all the evidence defendant requested the court to direct a verdict in its favor, insisting that plaintiff had failed to prove accidental death and that the evidence showed death was caused by self-destruction, and was not sufficient to sustain a verdict for the plaintiff. The court denied the motion and submitted the case to the jury.\n Its charge contained the following:\n'In this case the defendant alleges that the death of E. Walter Gamer was caused by suicide. The burden of proving this allegation by a preponderance, or greater weight of the evidence, is upon the defendant. The presumption of law is that the death was not voluntary and the defendant ... must overcome this presumption and satisfy the jury by a preponderance of the evidence that his death was voluntary.\n\n'Ordinarily ... in the absence of a plea by the defendant of suicide or self-destruction the burden would be upon, and it still is upon, the plaintiff in this case to prove that Walter Gamer died from external, violent and acci- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 161, 167]\n\u00a0\n dental means, but by its answer ... the ... Company has admitted that ... (he) died through external and violent means. ... The question remains as to whether the death was accidentally caused, or the means of the death was accidental or whether it was suicide. But when the defendant took the position that it takes here it assumed the burden of proving to you by a preponderance of evidence that Walter Gamer killed himself voluntarily. ...\n\n'The presumption of law is that the death was not voluntary and the defendant in order to sustain the issue of suicide ... must overcome this presumption and satisfy the jury, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his death was voluntary. ...'\n\n The jury gave plaintiff a verdict for $20,000 with interest, and the court entered judgment in her favor for that amount. Defendant appealed, alleging that the trial judge erred in denying its motion for a directed verdict and in giving each of the quoted instructions. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 9 Cir., 90 F.2d 817. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n302 \nU.S. 670\n, 58 S.Ct. 46, 82 L.Ed. --. There are presented for decision, questions whether the trial court erred in refusing to direct a verdict for defendant or in giving any of the instructions quoted above.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals has twice held the evidence sufficient to sustain a verdict for plaintiff. It found that the facts brought forward at the second trial are not substantially different from those presented on the first appeal. There is no substantial controversy as to the principal evidentiary circumstances upon which depends decision of the controlling issue, whether the death of the insured was accidental. As we are of opinion that the trial court erred in giving the challenged instructions, and the judgment is to be reversed and the case remanded to the district court where another trial may be had, we \n\n[303 \nU.S. 161, 168]\n\u00a0\n refrain from discussion of the evidence. We find it sufficient to sustain a verdict for or against either party. Defendant was not entitled to a mandatory instruction.\n The form and substance of the challenged instructions suggest that the trial judge followed those brought before this Court in Travellers' Ins. Co. v. McConkey, \n127 \nU.S. 661\n, 8 S.Ct. 1360, 1361. The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals reads that case to require approval of the instructions here in question. As it has not been uniformly interpreted, we shall examine its principal features. There the accident policy sued on covered bodily injuries effected through external, violent, and accidental means when such injuries alone occasioned death or disability. A proviso declared that no claim should be made under the policy when the death or injury had been caused by suicide, or by intentional injuries inflicted by the insured or by any other person. The complaint alleged that the insured had been accidently shot by a person or persons unknown to plaintiff, by reason of which he instantly died. The answer denied that death was occasioned by bodily injuries effected through external, violent, and accidental means, and alleged that it was caused by suicide, or by intentional injuries inflicted either by the insured or by some other person.\n The statement of the case quotes the following instructions:\n'The plaintiff ... gives evidence of the fact that the insured was found dead ... from a pistol shot through the heart. This evidence satisfies the terms of the policy with respect to the fact that the assured came to his death by 'external and violent means,' and the only question is whether the means by which he came to his death were also 'accidental.'\n\n'It is manifest that self-destruction cannot be presumed. ... The plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover unless the defendant has by competent evidence overcome \n\n[303 \nU.S. 161, 169]\n\u00a0\n this presumption, and satisfied the jury by a preponderance of evidence that the injuries which caused the death of the insured were intentional on his part.\n\n'Neither is murder to be presumed ... but, if the jury find ... that the insured was in fact murdered, the death was an accident as to him . ... If ... the injuries of the insured ... were not intentional on his part, the plaintiff has a right to recover. ... The inquiry ... is resolved into a question of suicide, because, if the insured was murdered, the destruction of his life was not intentional on his part.\n\n'The defendant, in its answer, alleges that the death of the insured was caused by suicide. The burden of proving this allegation by a preponderance of evidence rests on the defendant.'\n\n This Court held that the trial judge erred in charging that if the insured was murdered plaintiff was entitled to recover and on that ground reversed the judgment and remanded the case with directions to grant a new trial.\n It was not necessary to consider any other question. But, for guidance of the trial ordered, the Court discussed other parts of the charge.\n At the outset the opinion declares that under the issue presented by the general denial it was incumbent on plaintiff to show that the death was the result not only of external and violent, but also of accidental means. It states that the two 'principal facts to be established, were external violence and accidental means, producing death. The first was established when it appeared that death ensued from a pistol shot through the heart of the insured. The evidence on that point was direct and positive. ... Were the means by which the insured came to his death also accidental? If he committed suicide, then the law was for the company, because the policy ... did not extend to ... self-destruction.'\n The opinion proceeds, \n127 \nU.S. 661\n, at page 667, 8 S.Ct. 1360, 1363: 'Did the court err in saying to the jury that, upon the issue as to suicide, the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 161, 170]\n\u00a0\n law was for the plaintiff, unless that presumption was overcome by competent evidence? This question must be answered in the negative. The condition that direct and positive proof must be made of death having been caused by external, violent, and accidental means, did not deprive the plaintiff when making such proof, of the benefit of the rules of law established for the guidance of courts and juries in the investigation and determination of facts.'\n The statement just quoted, lacking somewhat of the precision generally found in opinions of the Court prepared by its eminent author, has been variously construed. The question it propounds does not fully reflect the substance of the charge which put on the defendant the burden of proving suicide by preponderance of the evidence. However, the opinion shows that the burden was on plaintiff to prove death by accident as defined in the contract. It contains nothing to suggest that the court deemed the issue as to burden of proof arising on general denial to be affected by defendant's allegation of suicide. It held that if the insured committed suicide, plaintiff had no claim; that, from the fact of death by violence, accident would be presumed, and that unless the presumption was overcome by evidence the law was for plaintiff. The opinion does not indicate the quantum of proof required to put an end to the presumption. It is consistent with, if indeed it does not support, the rule that the presumption is not evidence and ceases upon the introduction of substantial proof to the contrary. Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence, p. 346; Mobile, J. & K.C.R. v. Turnipseed, \n219 \nU.S. 35, 43\n, 31 S. Ct. 136, 32 L.R.A.,N.S., 226, Ann.Cas.1912A, 463; Western & A. R. Co. v. Henderson, \n279 \nU.S. 639, 642\n, 644 S., 49 S.Ct. 445, 447; Heiner v. Donnan, \n285 \nU.S. 312, 329\n, 52 S.Ct. 358, 362; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v.

The opinion did not definitely sustain any of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 161, 171]\n\u00a0\n the charges to which it referred. It falls far short of sustaining the instructions challenged in the present case.\n Under the contract in the case now before us, double indemnity is payable only on proof of death by accident as there defined. The burden was on plaintiff to allege and by a preponderance of the evidence to prove that fact. The complaint alleged accident and negatived self-destruction. The answer denied accident and alleged suicide. Plaintiff's negation of self-destruction taken with defendant's allegation of suicide served to narrow the possible field of controversy. Only the issue of accidental death vel non remained. The question of fact to be tried was precisely the same as if plaintiff merely alleged accidental death and defendant interposed denial without more. Travelers' Ins. Co. v. Wilkes, 5 Cir., 76 F.2d 701, 705; Fidelity & Casualty Co. of New York v. Driver, 5 Cir., 79 F. 2d 713, 714; Cf. Home Benefit Association v. Sargent, \n142 \nU.S. 691\n, 12 S. Ct. 332\n\n\n Upon the fact of violent death without more, the presumption, i.e., the applicable rule of law, required the inference of death by accident rather than by suicide. As the case stood on the pleadings, the law required judgment for plaintiff. Travellers' Ins. Co. v. McConkey, supra, \n127 \nU.S. 661\n, at page 665, 8 S.Ct. 1360. It was not submitted on pleadings but on pleadings and proof. In his charge the judge had to apply the law to the case as it then was. The evidence being sufficient to sustain a finding that the death was not due to accident, there was no foundation of fact for the application of the presumption; and the case stood for decision by the jury upon the evidence unaffected by the rule that from the fact of violent death, there being nothing to show the contrary, accidental death will be presumed. The presumption is not evidence and may not be given weight as evidence. Despiau v. United States Casualty Co., 1 Cir., 89 F.2d 43, 44; Jefferson Standard Life \n\n[303 \nU.S. 161, 172]\n\u00a0\n Ins. Co. v. Clemmer, 4 Cir., 79 F.2d 724, 730, 103 A.L.R. 171; Travelers' Ins. Co. v.

Co., 8 Cir., 72 F.2d 306, 308, 310; Nichols v. New York Life Ins. Co., supra.\n In determining whether by the greater weight of evidence it has been established that the death of the insured was accidental, the jury is required to consider all admitted and proved facts and circumstances upon which the determination of that issue depends and, in reaching its decision, should take into account the probabilities found from the evidence to attend the claims of the respective parties.\n The challenged instructions cannot be sustained.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK (dissenting).\n The judgment below rests upon an insurance policy contract made in Butte, Montana. Plaintiff filed suit for more than $3,000 in a Montana state court, and the insurance company-because it was not a Montana corporation-was able to remove the suit to the Federal District Court. Plaintiff's judgment in the District Court was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. This Court now reverses plaintiff's judgment because the District Court instructed the jury that-evidence having established the death of the insured by violent and external means-the law presumed from these facts that the death 'was not voluntary and ... the defendant must overcome this presumption and satisfy the jury by a preponderance of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 161, 173]\n\u00a0\n the evidence, that his death was voluntary. ...' The policy of insurance was a Montana contract and even though the company was able to remove plaintiff's case to a federal court, I believe the plaintiff's rights should be determined by Montana law. Under Montana law I believe the above instructions were proper.\n The Supreme Court of Montana has said:1 'Where, as here, death is shown as the result of external and violent means and the issue is whether it was due to accident or suicide, the presumption is in favor of accident.'\n The majority agree with the Montana law up to this point, saying: 'Upon the fact of violent death without more, the presumption, i.e., the applicable rule of law, required the inference of death by accident rather than by suicide.' At this point, agreement ends between the rule here declared by the majority and the law of Montana.\n Under Montana law the presumption that violent death was accidental and not suicidal continues and does not disappear unless the evidence 'all points to suicide ... with such certainty as to preclude any other reasonable hypothesis'; and the presumption continues for the jury's consideration except 'when the evidence points overwhelmingly to suicide as the cause of death.' 2 \n\n[303 \nU.S. 161, 174]\n\u00a0\n Contrary to this clear statement by the Montana Supreme Court is the different rule clearly announced by the majority here in holding that the presumption disappears after the insurance company introduced evidence merely 'sufficient to sustain a finding that the death was not due to accident.'\n This Court does not find that the evidence in this case excludes every other reasonable hypothesis but suicide or that all of the evidence points 'unerringly to suicide as the cause of death.' \n3\n On the contrary the majority opinion states: 'We find it (the evidence) sufficient to sustain a verdict for or against either party. Defendant was not entitled to a mandatory instruction.'\n It is obvious that the majority here declare a rule based neither on Montana law nor federal statute. This federal judicial rule must none the less be followed in suits on insurance policies tried in federal courts. The result \n\n[303 \nU.S. 161, 175]\n\u00a0\n is that suits on policies for less than $3,000 tried in state courts will frequently be decided by rules different from the rule which governs similar suits tried in federal courts because they involve more than $3, 000. In an orderly and consistent system of jurisprudence, it is important that the same law should fix and control the right of recovery on substantially identical contracts made in the same jurisdiction and under the same circumstances. Neither the company nor the policy holder should obtain an advantage by the application of a different law governing the contract merely because the case can be removed to a federal court.\n It was to avoid such results-among other reasons-that section 725, U. S.C. title 28, 28 U.S.C.A.  725 was passed. It provides: 'The laws of the several States, except where the Constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law, in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply.'\n In this case, the law determining the burden of proof as to suicide affects the substantial rights of the parties. \n4\n Substantial rights arising from an insurance contract are governed by the law of the state where the contract is made. \n5\n Since the court below instructed the jury in accordance with the law of Montana, I do not believe the charge constituted reversible error.\n Nor can I agree that we should approve a general rule governing trials in federal courts which in my judgment transfers jury functions to judges. The effect of the decision here is to give the trial judge the right to decide when sufficient evidence has been introduced to take from the jury the right to find accidental death from proof of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 161, 176]\n\u00a0\n death by violent and external means. This inevitably follows if the presumption, or right of the jury to infer death by accident, 'disappears' whenever the judge believes sufficient evidence of suicide has been introduced.\n Stripped of discussions of legal formulas designated as 'presumptions' and 'burden of proof,' the net result of the rule of 'disappearing presumptions' is that trial judges in federal courts ( irrespective of state rules) have the power to determine when sufficient 'substantial evidence' has been produced to justify taking from the jury the right to render a verdict on evidence which-had the judge not found it overcome by contradictory evidence-would have justified a verdict. The judge exercises this power as a 'trier of fact' although evidence, previously introduced and sufficient to support a verdict, has neither been excluded nor withdrawn.\n Proof of death by external and violent means has uniformly been held to establish death by accident. The extreme improbability of suicide is complete justification for a finding of death from accident under these circumstances. While it has been said that this proof of accidental death was based on 'presumption,' in reality-whatever words or formulas are used- what is meant is that a litigant has offered adequate evidence to establish accidental death. To attribute this adequacy of proof to a 'presumption' does not authorize or empower the judge to say that this 'adequate proof' (identical with legal 'presumption') has 'disappeared.' If the evidence offered by plaintiff provides adequate proof of accidental death upon which a jury's verdict can be sustained, mere contradictory evidence cannot overcome the original 'adequate proof' unless the authority having the constitutional power to weigh the evidence and decide the facts believes the contradictory evidence has overcome the original proof. The jury-not the judge-should decide when there has been 'substantial' evidence which overcomes \n\n[303 \nU.S. 161, 177]\n\u00a0\n the previous adequate proof. Here, this Court holds that at the conclusion of plaintiff's evidence the jury had adequate proof upon which to find accidental death, and which would authorize a verdict that insured died as result of accident, but also holds that, after subsequent contradictory evidence of defendant, the judge (not the jury) could decide that plaintiff's adequate proof (presumption) had 'disappeared' or had been overcome by this subsequent contradictory testimony. This took from the jury the right to decide the weight and effect of this subsequent contradictory evidence. Such a rule gives parties a trial by judge, but does not preserve, in its entirety, that trial by jury guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution. I cannot agree to a conclusion which, I believe, takes away any part of the constitutional right to have a jury pass upon the weight of all of the facts introduced in evidence.\n I believe the judgment of the court below should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Nichols v.

In a case involving an action on an insurance policy, in which the McConkey Case, supra, was followed, the Supreme Court of Montana said:\n'The testimony as to the incidents connected with the death of the insured is slight, but is sufficient to establish the death of insured by external and violent means. ...\n\n\"If plaintiff had 'shown by the fair weight of the evidence that the assured came to his death as the result of a pistol shot, ... then the law will presume that the shot was accidental, and that it was not inflicted with murderous or suicidal intent.

Cox, Davidson Sommers, Sol Charles Levine, and Paul Windels, all of New York City, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is the constitutional validity of Local Laws of the City of New York, Local Law No. 21 (published as No. 22), p. 151 of 1934, as amended by Local Law No. 2, p. 94, of 1935, and extended by Local Law No. 30, p. 157 of 1935, which provide, section 2, that 'for the privilege of exercising its franchise or franchises, or of holding property, or of doing business in \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 576]\n\u00a0\n the city of New York' an excise tax shall be paid by every 'utility' doing business in the City of New York during 1935 and the first six months of 1936\n\n\n'Utility' is defined, section 1(e), to include 'any person subject to the supervision of either division of the department of public service,' and every person, whether or not subject to such supervision, engaged 'in the business of furnishing or selling to other persons gas, electricity, steam, water, refrigeration, telephony and\/or telegraphy' or service in these commodities. Each utility is required to pay a tax 'equal to three per centum of its gross income' (section 5) received during the effective period of the Local Laws, with a minor variation not here assailed for utilities not subject to the specified supervision. \n1\n The Local Laws specify that all revenues from the tax 'shall be deposited in a separate bank account or accounts, and shall be available and used solely and exclusively for the purpose of relieving the people of the city of New York from the hardships and suffering caused by unemployment'. Section 14. The Local Laws, admittedly passed under authority granted by the state Legislature,2 are assailed under the United States Constitution. For convenience we shall discuss the contentions of the New York Rapid Transit Corporation alone, as determination of the objections \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 577]\n\u00a0\n raised by it is conclusive of those advanced by the Brooklyn and Queens Transit Corporation.\n\n The New York Rapid Transit Corporation operates rapid transit railroads in the City of New York under a contract known as contract No. 4, dated March 19, 1913, made pursuant to the New York Rapid Transit Act Laws 1891, c. 4, as amended, between its predecessor (New York Municipal Railway Corporation) and the city. As a common carrier engaged in the operation of rapid transit railroads, the corporation is under the supervision of the transit commission, the head of the metropolitan division of the state department of public service. Accordingly, but under protest, it paid the taxes imposed by the Local Laws set out above, for the months January, 1935, to June, 1936, inclusive. It brought this action against the City of New York to recover the amounts paid,  1,408,697, with interest, on the ground that the Local Laws are unconstitutional. The case arises on the city's motion to dismiss the complaint.\n The Supreme Court of New York, Special Term, denied the motion to dismiss the complaint and found that the Local Laws denied equal protection because of gross inequality of burden in comparison with other utilities. This order was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, without opinion, on a 3-2 vote. Brooklyn & Queens Transit Corp. v. City of New York, 251 App.Div. 710, 296 N.Y.S. 1006. The Court of Appeals reversed (New York Rapid Transit Co. v. City of New York, 275 N.Y. 258, 9 N.E.2d 858), upheld the Local Laws against all attacks, and ruled that the complaint did not state a cause of action. Appeal was taken to this Court under section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344.\n The corporation challenges the Local Laws as violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the contracts clause of article 1,  10, of the Constitution. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 578]\n\u00a0\n I. Classification. No question is or could be made by the corporation as to the right of a state, or a municipality with properly delegated powers, to enact laws or ordinances, based on reasonable classification of the objects of the legislation or of the persons whom it affects. 'Equal protection' does not prohibit this. Although the wide discretion as to classification retained by a Legislature often results in narrow distinctions, these distinctions, if reasonably related to the object of the legislation, are sufficient to justify the classification. German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, \n233 \nU.S. 389, 418\n, 34 S.Ct. 612, L.R.A. 1915C, 1189; Atchison, Topeka & S.F.R.R. v. Matthews, \n174 \nU.S. 96, 105\n, 19 S.Ct. 609; Giozza v. Tiernan, \n148 \nU.S. 657\n, 13 S.Ct. 721. Indeed, it has long been the law under the Fourteenth Amendment that 'a distinction in legislation is not arbitrary, if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it.' Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 \nU.S. 342, 357\n, 36 S.Ct. 370, 374, L.R.A.1917A, 421, Ann.Cas.1917B, 455; Borden's Company v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 194, 209\n, 55 S.Ct. 187, 191; Metropolitan Casualty Co. v. Brownell, \n294 \nU.S. 580, 584\n, 55 S.Ct. 538, 540. 'The rule of equality permits many practical inequalities.'

Southern Coal & Coke Co., \n301 \nU.S. 495, 509\n, 57 S.Ct. 868, 872, 109 A.L.R. 1327. 'What satisfies this equality has not been, and probably never can be, precisely defined.' Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, supra, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 293\n, 18 S.Ct. 594, 598.\n The power to make distinctions exists with full vigor in the field of taxation, where no 'iron rule' of equality has ever been enforced upon the states. Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S.Ct. 533; Giozza v. Tiernan, \n148 \nU.S. 657, 662\n, 13 S.Ct. 721. A state may exercise a wide discretion in selecting the subjects of taxation (Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 294\n, 18 S. Ct. 594; Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59, 62\n, 32 S.Ct. 192; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 \nU.S. 245, 255\n, 43 S. Ct. 83, 84) 'particularly \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 579]\n\u00a0\n as respects occupation taxes.' Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord, \n262 \nU.S. 172, 179\n, 43 S.Ct. 526, 529; Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 563, 573\n, 30 S.Ct. 578; Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114, 121\n, 126 S., 30 S.Ct. 496; see Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n281 \nU.S. 146, 159\n, 50 S.Ct. 310, 313.\n Since carriers or other utilities with the right of eminent domain, the use of public property, special franchises or public contracts, have many points of distinction from other business, including relative freedom from competition, especially significant with increasing density of population and municipal expansion, these public service organizations have no valid ground by virtue of the equal protection clause to object to separate treatment related to such distinctions. Carriers may be treated as a separate class (compare Seaboard Air Line v. Seegers, \n207 \nU.S. 73\n, 28 S.Ct. 28) and, as such, taxed differently or additionally. Southern R. Co. v. Watts, \n260 \nU.S. 519, 530\n, 43 S.Ct. 192, 197. This Court has approved the adoption of modes and methods of assessment and administration peculiar to railroads (Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases, Cincinnati, N.O. & T.P.R. Co. v. Kentucky, \n115 \nU.S. 321, 337\n, 6 S. Ct. 57), and upheld tax rates for railroads differing from those on other property, and as between railroad taxpayers, Michigan Central R. Co. v. Powers, \n201 \nU.S. 245, 300\n, 26 S.Ct. 459; Ohio Tax Cases, \n232 \nU.S. 576, 590\n, 34 S.Ct. 372; Columbus & G. Ry. Co. v. Miller, \n283 \nU.S. 96\n, 51 S.Ct. 392. Similarly, we have explicitly recognized that a state may subject public service corporations to a special or higher income tax than individuals or other corporations. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Daughton, \n262 \nU.S. 413, 424\n, 43 S.Ct. 620, 624. The corporation concedes this general right to set apart the utilities in New York for taxation.\n The corporation is brought within the purview of the Local Laws because 'utility' is defined to include those 'subject to the supervision ... of the department of public service.' Section 1(e). It contends that classification in an \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 580]\n\u00a0\n excise tax, however, should be made by specific reference to the character of the business to be taxed, and that it is arbitrary to make taxability depend on whether a person is subject to the supervision of a commission. Valid reason for the definition utilized appears from the fact that the Local Laws merely adopted the classification previously established in the New York Public Service Law, N.Y.Laws 1910, c. 480, as amended, Consol. Laws, c. 48, which had selected those offering several kinds of public services, including the transportation of persons and property, section 25, 3 and made them subject to the supervision of the department of public service.\n Several reasons may be suggested for the selection for special tax burdens of the utilities embraced by the Local Laws under discussion. We mention a few. Those subject to the supervision of the department of public service are assured by statute that new private enterprises may not enter into direct competition without a showing of convenience and necessity for the public service. \n4\n See New York Steam Corp. v. City of New York, 268 N.Y. 137, 147, 197 N.E. 172, 99 A.L.R. 1157. The corporation suggests that the statute does not curb competition from the city's own rapid transit lines and from taxicabs. Freedom from unlimited, direct, private competition is of itself a sufficient advantage over ordinary businesses to warrant the imposition of a heavier tax burden. Reports which must be filed with the department of public service on the basis of approved systems of accounting suggest an administrative convenience in the collection and verification of the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 581]\n\u00a0\n tax5 which might properly have been taken into account by the city's Legislature. See Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., \n301 \nU.S. 495, 511\n, 57 S.Ct. 868, 873, 109 A.L.R. 1327, and cases cited. The Legislature may reasonably have conceived that the revenues of utilities furnishing indispensable services are subject to relatively little fluctuation, even in depression times, and reasonably have shaped its tax system accordingly.\n II. Discrimination. The corporation urges here, as the lower state courts held, that these general principles of classification are not effective to validate legislation where, as in these Local Laws, arbitrary, unreasonable and hostile discrimination against certain railroad companies is shown. This unlawful discrimination appears, because 'they are,' as the corporation sees it, 'in a far poorer position to bear the burden of unemployment relief than is business in general.' Business may pass on taxes. Other utilities may apply to the commission and perhaps to the courts for an adequate rate increase. This corporation cannot do so as by contract No. 4 with the city it is bound to furnish transportation for a five-cent fare, which by city charter provision cannot be changed without the approval of the proposal by a majority of the qualified voters, on referendum. \n6\n It is alleged in the complaint that rapid transit corporations are less able to pay a gross receipts tax than other utilities, whose \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 582]\n\u00a0\n gross income yields a higher percentage of profit, that the operation and maintenance expenses of these corporations are higher in relation to gross receipts than those of other utilities, the ratio of net income to gross receipts, lower. It is said to be highly discriminatory to classify these railroads apart from other businesses, or in the same group as other utilities. The differences from business are not enough and from other utilities too great to justify this attempted classification, which sets them apart from business as a whole, and yokes them with other utilities.\n The disadvantages complained of, as to fare limitations, are applicable only to the corporation, a single member of a class of utilities. It is quite fortuitous that this particular corporation must seek adjustments in fare in a peculiar way. 'The legislature is not required to make meticulous adjustments in an effort to avoid incidental hardships.' See Great Atlantic & Pac. Tea Co. v. Grosjean, \n301 \nU.S. 412, 424\n, 57 S.Ct. 772, 776, 112 A.L.R. 293. 'If the accidents of trade lead to inequality or hardship, the consequences must be accepted as inherent in government by law instead of government by edict.' Fox v. Standard Oil Co., \n294 \nU.S. 87, 102\n, 55 S.Ct. 333, 339.\n In comparing its burdens with those of other utilities, the corporation, by its argument, suggests that a gross receipts tax is invalid while a net income tax is valid. In taxing utilities as a class the Legislature is not required to make 'meticulous adjustments' for a particular sub-class of utility. See Great Atlantic & Pac. Tea Co. v. Grosjean, \n301 \nU.S. 412\n, at page 424, 57 S.Ct. 772, 776, 112 A.L.R. 293, supra. Moreover, while taxation of net income is apportioned to ability to pay, and is therefore 'an equitable method of distributing the burdens of government,' see New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, \n300 \nU.S. 308, 313\n, 57 S.Ct. 466, 467, 108 A.L.R. 721, it is not a compulsory method. There are other justifications for the gross receipts tax. Unconcerned \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 583]\n\u00a0\n with disputes about permissible deductions, it has greater certitude and facility of administration than the net income tax, an important consideration to taxpayer and tax gatherer alike. And the volume of transactions indicated on the taxpayer's books may bear a closer relation to the cost of governmental supervision and protection than the annual profit and loss statement. In Clark v. Titusville, \n184 \nU.S. 329\n, at page 334, 22 S.Ct. 382, 384 we rejected an equal protection objection to a license tax on merchants, which we said was 'a tax on the privilege of doing business, regulated by the amount of sales, and ... not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.' And we have heretofore had occasion to remark that gross receipts from an occupation constitutes an 'appropriate measure of the value of the privilege' of engaging in that occupation. Western Live Stock v. Bingaman, \n303 \nU.S. 250\n, 58 S.Ct. 546, 549, decided February 28, 1938; American Manufacturing Co. v. St. Louis, \n250 \nU.S. 459, 463\n, 39 S.Ct. 522; State of Maine v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co., \n142 \nU.S. 217, 228\n, 12 S.Ct. 121, 163.\n Reliance is placed upon certain language of the opinion in Stewart Dry Goods Co. v. Lewis, \n294 \nU.S. 550\n, 55 S.Ct. 525. But the tax on retailers held invalid in that case increased in rate with increasing volume. The Court said that the excise was laid upon the making of a sale, and that the statute 'exacts from two persons different amounts for the privilege of doing exactly similar acts because the one has performed the act oftener than the other.' \n294 \nU.S. 550\n, at page 566, 55 S. Ct. 525, 532. For that reason it was thought necessary to inquire whether the tax could be justified as related to ability to pay, an inquiry we need not here pursue. The Court did not condemn a fixed-rate gross receipts tax, such as is involved in the present case. Indeed it suggested that the 'desired end' might have been secured by the widely adopted 'flat tax on sales' (at page 563 of 294 U.S., 55 S.Ct. 525, 531), and indicated by way of contrast that though such a tax 'would impose a heavier burden on the taxpayer having the greater volume \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 584]\n\u00a0\n of sales' the graduated tax under consideration exacted not only a larger gross amount but one 'larger in proportion to sales' (at page 564 of 294 U. S., 55 S.Ct. 525, 531).\n III. Relation to Object of Legislation. As a further ground for the invalidity of the Local Laws the corporation urges that 'the classification must rest upon some ground of difference, having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation.' It is asserted and correctly so, that the Local Laws in question, as well as the state enabling statutes, show by their titles and content that the proceeds of the challenged taxes were for the relief of unemployment. \n7\n Violation of the rule invoked, it is asserted, occurs from the discrimination shown by the legislation in raising 'a special fund for the particular purpose' from taxpayers no more responsible than others for the conditions. The corporation seems to be of the opinion that no 'state or city can, without conflict with the Constitution, adopt a tax statute, which states a specific object sought to be accomplished thereby and which at the same time puts the entire burden of the tax \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 585]\n\u00a0\n upon one particular class of business, even though that class is in no different position in relation to the object sought to be accomplished than business in general.' The brief states the point to be 'that there is a distinction between the ordinary excise tax with no specific purpose attached thereto, and a tax which is a part of a plan for the accomplishment of a specified object.' The 'object of the legislation,' to the taxpayer, is apparently the relief of unemployment.\n While, of course, the object of this legislation is in a sense to relieve unemployment, this is the object of the appropriation of the proceeds of the tax. The 'object,' as used in the rule and cases referred to by the corporation, is the object of the taxing provisions, i.e., the raising of the money. If the designation of utilities as the only taxpayers under the legislation in question does not deny to them the equal protection of the laws, the fact that an appropriation of the funds, for relief is a part of the legislation is not significant. 'A tax is not an assessment of benefits.' Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 586]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n301 \nU.S. 495, 522\n, 57 S.Ct. 868, 878, 109 A.L.R. 1327. Taxes are repeatedly imposed on a group or class without regard to responsibility for the creation or relief of the conditions to be remedied. Idem, note 14, at page 522 of 301 U.S., 57 S.Ct. 868, 878, 109 A.L.R. 1327. The Carmichael Case involved a state act which levied a tax on employers of eight or more to provide unemployment benefits for workers employed by this class of employers. It was urged that the classification should have been based on the unemployment record of the employer i.e., should have borne a relation to the object of unemployment relief. Against this contention, that there was no relation between the class of taxpayers and the purpose for which the fund was raised, this Court held that it is not necessary that there be 'such a relationship between the subject of the tax (the exercise of the right to employ) and the evil to be met by the appropriation of the proceeds (unemployment).' At page 522 of 301 U.S., 57 S.Ct. 868, 878, 109 A.L.R. 1327. See, also, Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, \n301 \nU.S. 308, 313\n, 57 S. Ct. 764, 766. The corporation suggests that in the Carmichael Case there was a special relationship between the class taxed and the purpose for which the proceeds were spent, but the Court expressly said that this was something 'the Constitution does not require.' At page 523, of 301 U.S., 57 S.Ct. 868, 879, 109 A.L.R. 1327. There need be no relation between the class of taxpayers and the purpose of the appropriation.\n The cases cited by the corporation, to sustain its contention that classification must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, do not support the conclusion that the 'object' referred to is the purpose for which the proceeds are to be spent. These authorities rather support the view that the 'object' is the revenue to be raised by the acts. In Colgate v. Harvey, \n296 \nU.S. 404\n at pages 423, 424, 56 S.Ct. 252, 256, 102 A.L.R. 54, it was recognized that the classification 'must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation' but it \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 587]\n\u00a0\n was said that 'the object of the act ... simply is to secure revenue.' In Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137\n, 45 S.Ct. 424, 44 A.L.R. 1454, Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, \n253 \nU.S. 412\n, 40 S.Ct. 560, and Air Way Electric Appliance Corporation v. Day, \n266 \nU.S. 71\n, 45 S. Ct. 12, the rule contended for by the corporation was recognized but with no intimation that the 'object' was considered to be the purpose for which the proceeds of the tax were spent. The 'object' of the Local Laws under consideration, as in the case with most tax statutes, was obviously to secure revenue. In some cases a classification of taxpayers may be upheld as having a fair and substantial relation to a constitutional nonfiscal object (Alaska Fish Salting & By-Products Co. v. Smith, \n255 \nU.S. 44, 48\n, 41 S.Ct. 219, 220; Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59, 62\n, 63 S., 32 S.Ct. 192; Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, \n295 \nU.S. 285, 291\n, 55 S.Ct. 709, 711), but it is not constitutionally necessary that the classification be related to the appropriation. In United States v. Butler, \n297 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 312, 102 A.L.R. 914, also relied upon by the corporation, the attack on the federal statute was successful because the tax was said to be a part of an unconstitutional scheme to regulate production through expenditures. It was not held invalid because there was no relation between the taxpayer and the appropriation. See Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, supra. We conclude, therefore, that the provisions of the legislation earmarking the funds collected are not of importance in determining whether or not the classification of the challenged acts is discriminatory.\n What we have said in showing that the Local Laws do not deny the equal protection of the laws also disposes of the corporation's contention that the Local Laws constitute a deprivation of due process, as being measured without regard to the net income of or ruinous effect on the taxpayers, and as laying on a particular class a burden which should be borne by all. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 588]\n\u00a0\n IV. Contracts Clause. \n8\n The corporation contends that, in contravention of the Constitution, article 1,  10, the Local Laws impair the obligation of the contract known as contract No. 4, entered into March 19, 1913, between its predecessor and the city, under which it operates its owned and leased properties in New York.\n By the terms of the contract, as summarized in the corporation's complaint, the city agreed to construct certain rapid transit railroads, and the New York Municipal Railway Corporation, appellant's predecessor, agreed to contribute a portion of the cost of construction and to equip the railroads for operation. The latter further agreed to reconstruct and build additions to certain existing railroads, which it then had the right and duty to operate, so as to adapt them for operation in conjunction with the railroads to be constructed by the city. Under the terms of contract No. 4, the city leased the railroads which it agreed to construct, and their equipment, which was to be furnished by the lessee, to the New York Municipal Railway Corporation, its successors and assigns, for a term of 49 years commencing on or about the first day of January, 1917, and the lessee agreed to operate said railroads to be constructed by the city in conjunction with the existing railroads as one system, and for a single fare not exceeding five cents.\n The gross receipts of all the railroads combined from whatever source derived, directly or indirectly, were to be pooled. The city and its lessee were to share the receipts equally after the deduction of certain items provided in article XLIX of contract No. 4. It will suffice here if we summarize the provisions for deductions in \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 589]\n\u00a0\n the language of appellant. The deductions were for the following purpose and in the following order:\n'1. Rentals actually paid by Lessee under leases approved by the Commission;\n\n'2. Taxes (The full provision as to 'taxes' is set forth later);\n\n'3. Operating expenses exclusive of maintenance;\n\n'4. Charges for maintenance of both the Railroad and the Existing Railroads (Railroad refers to the system to be constructed by the City; Existing Railroads refers to the company-owned lines as they existed at the time of execution of the contract);\n\n'5. Charges for depreciation of the Railroad, the equipment, and the Existing Railroads;\n\n'6. To be retained by the Lessee: 1\/4th of $3,500,000, representing the average income from operation of the Existing Railroads;\n\n'7. To be retained by the Lessee: 1\/4th of 6% per annum on (a) the Lessee's contribution to cost of construction of the Railroad, (b) cost of equipment furnished by the Lessee, (c) cost of extensions and additional tracks constructed by the Lessee, and (d) cost of reconstruction of Existing Railroads (out of which quarterly payments the Lessee is required to amortize such costs);\n\n'8. To be retained by the Lessee: 1\/4th of the actual annual interest payable by Lessee upon the cost of additional equipment, plus an amortization charge;\n\n'9. To be paid to the City: 1\/4th of the annual interest payable by it upon its share of the cost of construction of the Railroad plus an amortization charge;\n\n'10. To be paid to the City: 1\/4th of the annual interest payable by the City upon cost of construction of additions to the Railroad plus an amortization charge;\n\n'11. 1% of the gross receipts, to be paid into a contingent reserve fund. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 590]\n\u00a0\n 'In connection with the above allocation provisions, Contract No. 4 provided (Art. LI) that if in any quarter the gross receipts should be insufficient to meet the various obligations and deductions above recited, the deficits should be cumulative, and payment thereof should be made in the order of priority above set forth.'\n\n The corporation does not claim that contract No. 4 exempts it or its property from taxation generally. It does assert that the city 'may not, in the exercise of its governmental power, subject appellant to the payment of a tax on or measured by the gross receipts of the combined system of railroads,' and that 'by providing in specific terms for the disposition and allocation of the entire gross receipts, the parties necessarily precluded any kind of tax or charge by the City which would directly and specifically alter such disposition and allocation, to appellant's prejudice, except in so far as any such tax or charge may clearly be said to have been provided for in the contract provisions as to the disposition of gross receipts.'\n The corporation further complains that the tax payments deprive it of 'a substantial part of the interest and sinking fund allowance to which it was entitled' under deductions Nos. 7 and 8 set out above. The loss thus suffered was alleged to total more than $600,000.\n We search in vain for any provision in the contract which expressly exempts the corporation from payment of this tax, or indeed of any tax. Yet this is what is required before support can be obtained from the contracts clause. More than 100 years ago it was stated by Chief Justice Marshall, in Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514, 562, 563, that the taxing power is of such 'vital importance' that 'We must look for the exemption in the language of the instrument; and if we do not find it there, it would be going very far, to insert it by construction.' In Erie Ry. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 21 Wall. 492, 499, this Court said that 'the language in which the sur- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 591]\n\u00a0\n render is made must be clear and unmistakable.' At the present term, the Court has reiterated that contracts of tax exemption are 'to be read narrowly and strictly.' Hale v. State Board, \n302 \nU.S. 95, 109\n, 58 S.Ct. 102, 107. See, also, Pacific Co. v. Johnson, \n285 \nU.S. 480, 491\n, 52 S.Ct. 424, 426; Puget Sound Power & Light Co. v. Seattle, \n291 \nU.S. 619, 627\n, 54 S.Ct. 542, 546.\n Not only is the corporation unable to point to an unmistakable exemption, but the contract itself contains an express provision permitting the deduction of taxes from the gross receipts. \n9\n Its language is broad. It refers to 'all taxes ... of every description (whether on physical property, stock or securities, corporate or other franchises, or otherwise) assessed or which may hereafter be assessed against the Lessee in connection with ... the operation of the ... Railroads.' The taxes under discussion clearly come within its terms.\n It is alleged that, at the time of the execution of the contracts, and prior to the passage of the state enabling acts,10 the tax power of the city was confined to special assessments for public improvements, and ad valorem taxes on real estate and special franchises issued by the city. The corporation insists that it was contemplated that no other type of tax would be assessed, and that it was not necessary to make provision for exemption since the corporation was merely accepting the tax burden common to all owners of property. It is urged that the contract be interpreted from this point of view, and the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 592]\n\u00a0\n provision limited to taxes of the type which the city could have imposed in 1913.\n There is no reason to limit the ordinary meaning of words used in a contract by men prepared to invest under its terms. 'A business proposition involving the outlay of very large sums cannot be and is not taken by the parties concerned according to offhand impressions; it is scrutinized phrase by phrase and word by word.' People of State of New York ex rel. Interborough Rapid Transit Co. v. Sohmer, \n237 \nU.S. 276, 284\n, 35 S.Ct. 549, 551; cf. Ohio Life Ins. & T. Co. v. Debolt, 16 How. 416, 435.\n Where the intention was to prevent the imposition of new taxes, adequate language was available. The court below adverted to its opinion in Brooklyn Bus Corp. v. City of New York, 274 N.Y. 140, 8 N.E.2d 309, 311, where the contract entitled the corporation to a broader tax exemption because it provided that 'any new form of tax or additional charge that may be imposed by any ordinance of the City or resolution of the Board upon or in respect of the franchise ... shall be deducted from the compensation payable to the City hereunder.'\n A similar suggestion that the contract be limited to the taxes known at the time of its making was urged upon us, and discarded, in J. W. Perry Co. v. Norfolk, \n220 \nU.S. 472\n, 31 S.Ct. 465. Under a lease made by Norfolk in 1792, when Norfolk was a borough without power to tax, the lessee agreed to pay, in addition to rent, 'the public taxes which shall become due on said land.' The lessee sought to enjoin the collection of taxes in 1906 by the City of Norfolk, on the ground that the parties contemplated only taxes imposed by Virginia or the United States. This Court held that the language was broad enough to cover the city tax, saying (at page 480 of 220 U.S., 31 S.Ct. 465, 468), that 'the provision that the lessee was to 'pay public taxes' was sufficiently comprehensive to embrace municipal taxes whenever they could thereafter be lawfuly assessed on land or the improve- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 593]\n\u00a0\n ments which were a part of the land. Where one relies upon an exemption from taxation, both the power to exempt and the contract of exemption must be clear. Any doubt or ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the public.'\n Admitting that with respect to a franchise contract silent as to taxes the city may validly impose a license tax on the privilege of doing business, since 'surrender of the state's power to tax the privilege is not to be implied from the grant of it,' Puget Sound Power & Light Co. v. Seattle, \n291 \nU.S. 619, 627\n, 54 S.Ct. 542, 546, it is urged by the corporation that here the city is violating the affirmative covenants of a contract, namely, the provisions for allocation of revenue. The contention is made that these provisions preclude an 'alteration' by virtue of a gross receipts tax.\n This Court, in construing a contract to determine whether or not legislation is violative of its provisions within the meaning of the contract clause of the Constitution will examine for itself the existence and meaning of the contract as well as the relation of the parties and the circumstances of its execution. Appleby v. City of New York, \n271 \nU.S. 364, 379\n, 380 S., 46 S.Ct. 569, 573; Funkhouser v. J. B. Preston Co., \n290 \nU.S. 163, 167\n, 54 S.Ct. 134, 135; Violet Trapping Co. v. Grace, \n297 \nU.S. 119, 120\n, 56 S.Ct. 386. But of course in so doing we 'lean toward agreement with the courts of the state, and accept their judgment as to such matters unless manifestly wrong.' Hale v. State Board, \n302 \nU.S. 95, 101\n, 58 S.Ct. 102, 103; Tampa Waterworks v. Tampa, \n199 \nU.S. 241, 243\n, 244 S., 26 S.Ct. 23; Southern Wisconsin Ry. Co. v. Madison, \n240 \nU.S. 457, 461\n, 36 S.Ct. 400. In this case the Court of Appeals of New York, 275 N.Y. 258, 268, 9 N. E.2d 858, 861, has determined that 'the right to tax cannot be lost by such tenuous implication,' i.e., on the theory that the tax enables the city to secure a portion of the gross income in contravention of the con- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 594]\n\u00a0\n tract. We see no reason for disagreeing with the conclusion of the Court of Appeals of New York upon this point.\n In effect the corporation is urging that a constructive condition restricting the city's power of taxation should be incorporated in the contract, by speculation as to what the parties must necessarily have intended, despite the long-standing rule that exemptions must be 'clear and unmistakable.' Erie R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 21 Wall, 492, and other cases, all cited supra.\n The corporation professes to dread an interpretation of the contract and the legislation, which will put it 'wholly at the mercy' of the city; under which the corporation's 'gross receipts would be disposed of, not as Contract No. 4 provides, but as the City may from time to time in its wisdom determine.' The corporation is not deprived of its right to resist on constitutional or legal grounds whatever tax or assessment may be imposed upon it or its property. The city cannot lay a gross receipts tax on the corporation unless it selects a class of taxpayers which meets the requirement of the equal protection to the laws. The provisions of the contract as to taxes are certainly not sufficiently explicit to justify us in denying to the city the right to collect such taxes as those involved in this litigation. The danger which the corporation sees from what it considers to be a violation by legislation of its contract rights is a danger which every utility, with a franchise which does not protect its property from additional taxation, must endure.\n Convincing precedent for the contention of the city is found in North Missouri R. Co. v. Maguire, 20 Wall. 46, 63, where this court considered a statute of Missouri which provided that the railroad could issue bonds having priority over the state's mortgage. The act made specific provision for the allocation of the earnings of the railroad company in much the same manner as contract No. 4 \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 595]\n\u00a0\n does in the present case. The act established a 'fund commissioner' and provided that the railroad company should pay over to this commissioner 'all the gross earnings and daily receipts.' It was provided that the commissioner should first pay amounts required for 'actual current expenditures'; should then make other specified deductions, and lastly, should apply any excess to certain first mortgage bonds and then against the railroad's debt to the state.\n Subsequently the State Constitution was amended to provide that an annual tax of 10 per cent. of the gross receipts should be levied on the North Missouri Railroad Company and two other named corporations. The state court held that the earlier statute constituted a contract but considered the payment of taxes to fall within 'current expenditures in carrying on the ordinary business.' In this Court, the company argued that the tax constituted a violation of this contract, since it overturned the allocation of receipts and had the effect of converting the state from a junior creditor to a first mortgagee.\n This Court agreed that 'serious difficulty' would arise if 'the ordinance was a mere change of the order of disbursing the receipts and earnings,' instead of 'an expression of the sovereign will of the people of the State levying taxes to pay and discharge the indebtedness of the State,' but concluded that the tax actually imposed was proper. Of the provisions for allocation of the gross receipts, the Court said (on page 63 of 20 Wall.):\n'Further examination of those provisions is certainly unnecessary, as it is too plain for argument that they do not afford the slightest support to the views of the plaintiffs. On the contrary, they are entirely silent upon the subject of taxation, and fully justify the remarks of the State court when they say that the subject of taxation forms no part of the contract contained in the act under consideration. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 573, 596]\n\u00a0\n 'Nothing is said about taxation, and it does not seem to have entered into the contract between the parties, but was obviously left where the law had placed it before the act was passed, nor was any provision made for the payment of taxes unless it may be held that the disbursements for that purpose may fairly be included in such as are required to pay the current expenditures in carrying on the ordinary business of the corporation.'\n\n In our opinion, as the contract does not prohibit this tax, the legislation does not violate the contracts clause.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n304 \nU.S. 588\n, 58 S.Ct. 939, 82 L.Ed. --.[ New York Rapid Transit Corp. v.

SCHAUFFLER(1938)\nNo. 305\nArgued: January 5, 1938Decided: January 31, 1938\n\n\n\n Messrs. H. H. Rumble, of Norfolk, Va., and Fred H. Skinner, of Newport News, Va. (Mr. John Marshall, of Newport News, Va., on the brief), for petitioner.\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and \n\n[303 \nU.S. 54, 55]\n\u00a0\n Robert B. Watts, of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company is a Virginia corporation engaged in the construction, overhaul, and repair of ships at its plant in that State. In June, 1937, the Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America filed with the National Labor Relations Board the charge that the company was 'dominating and interfering with the employees' right of self organization by dominating, interfering with and lending financial support to a so-called labor organization' at said plant known as 'Representation of Employees:; that the Company had discharged and refused to reinstate several employees at the plant 'because they joined and assisted a labor organization of their own choosing and engaged in concerted activities with fellow employees for collective bargaining and other mutual aid and protection'; and that by so doing the company was engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of section 8, subsections (1), (2) and (3), of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S. C.A.  158(1-3). Thereupon the Board, through its regional director for the Fifth Region, Bennett F. Schauffler, filed a complaint against the company and gave notice of a hearing pursuant to section 10(b) of the act, 29 U.S.C.A.  160(f).\n The company did not answer the complaint. Before the date assigned for the hearing, it brought, in the federal court for Eastern Virginia, this suit, in which it sought to enjoin Schauffler, Jacob Blum, the regional attorney for the Fifth Region, both citizens of Maryland; and the trial examiner designated or to be designated, from holding the hearing and taking further proceedings un- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 54, 56]\n\u00a0\n der the act. There were prayers for both an interlocutory and a final injunction and for a declaratory judgment that the act as applied to the company's business and its relations to its employees is unconstitutional. As the basis for this relief, it alleged facts similar to those set forth in the bill of the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Limited, in No. 181, decided this day, Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co., \n303 \nU.S. 41\n, 58 S. Ct. 459. It alleged, specifically, that neither the company's business nor its relations with its employees affected interstate or foreign commerce; that it had not engaged in any unfair labor practice; and that it would be irreparably damaged by the holding of the hearing of the Board and the taking of any action in connection therewith. Among the elements of irreparable injury alleged were that the company would be held up to scorn as a violator of a law of the United States and so would incur for as long as the proceedings lasted the odium and ill will of the public and of its own employees; that its officials would be compelled to produce evidence of a confidential nature; and that the pendency and holding of the Board's proceedings, regardless of their outcome, would impede the company in exercising its right to bargain freely with its employees.\n The case was heard by the District Court upon the plaintiff's application for a temporary injunction and the defendants' motion that the bill be dismissed on the ground, among others, that the company had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and that granting the relief prayed would be an usurpation of the authority exclusively vested by the act in the Circuit Court of Appeals. The court denied the temporary injunction and dismissed the bill on the ground that the company had 'a plain, adequate and exclusive remedy under the terms of the Act itself, that no irreparable damage is threatened, and that this (the District) Court has no jurisdiction of the controversy presented by the bill.' That decree was af- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 54, 57]\n\u00a0\n firmed by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which held that the company 'has an adequate remedy under the statute and may not apply for relief in equity until it has exhausted the administrative remedy there provided.' 91 F.2d 730, 731.\n We granted certiorari because of conflict with Myers et al. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 1 Cir., 89 F.2d 1000, in which the facts are substantially similar and the issues the same. That case is reversed by our opinion delivered this day in No. 181. For the reasons there stated, we affirm the decree herein, adding only the following.\n First. The company insists that, since the case was heard on motion to dismiss the bill which alleges that the company is not engaged in interstate or foreign commerce and its relations to its employees do not affect such commerce, these allegations must be accepted as true. The motion admits as facts allegations describing the manner in which the business is carried on, but not legal conclusions from those facts. The allegations that interstate or foreign commerce is not involved are conclusions of law. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The company urges that, since the Board can have jurisdiction only over businesses engaged in interstate or foreign commerce, since the company denies that it is so engaged, and the Federal Constitution does not permit vesting in an administrative body exclusive power to determine its own jurisdiction, the District Court must have power to pass upon that issue. The act does not purport to leave the determination wholly to the Board. It confers upon the Board exclusive initial power to make the investigation, but provides for judicial review by the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 54, 58]\n\u00a0\n Circuit Court of Appeals. \n2\n As the only question here involved is the power of the Board to make the investigation, we have no occasion to consider the extent of the review provided.\n It is suggested that, while the Board has the right and duty to make, under section 5 of the act, 29 U.S.C.A.  155, a preliminary informal inquiry before public action, for the purpose of informing itself whether a particular concern is subject to its authority, the District Court may entertain a suit to prevent the Board from conducting a public investigation under section 10, 29 U.S.C.A.  160, if the concern claims that it is not engaged in interstate or foreign commerce. The limitation suggested would, in large measure, defeat the purpose of the legislation. There is no basis in the act for such a contention.\n Third. The Circuit Court of Appeals having refused to grant an injunction staying the action by the Board pending the contemplated appeal, application for a stay was made to Mr. Justice Butler of this Court, after filing of the petition for a writ of certiorari. It has been called to our attention that, upon his denial of that application, the hearing was held before the trial examiner of the Board from August 30 to September 8, 1937, and has apparently been closed. To the extent that relief was sought to prevent the injury resulting from a hearing, the cause appears to be moot. But the cause cannot be disposed of as moot, as the trial examiner has not yet made his report to the Board; the Board has made no decision; and thus there is a possibility of further proceedings.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Pennie v.

CO.(1938)\nNo. 10\nArgued: December 8, 1937Decided: January 17, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 614, 615]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry K. Gibson, of Miami, Fla., J. Julien Southerland, of Miami Beach, Fla., and Scott M. Loftin, of Miami, Fla., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Giles J. Patterson, of Jacksonville, Fla., and T. J. Blackwell, of Miami, Fla., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether for the payment of its outstanding bonds the respondent town may tax petitioners' lands which, without statutory authority, were included by boundaries defined in proceedings for its incorporation. Petitioners' contention is that the lands never were within the boundaries of the towns de jure or de facto, and that therefore they are not subject to its taxing power.\n The Florida statutes empower the male inhabitants of any hamlet, village, or town 'to establish for themselves a municipal government,' Compiled General Laws 1927,  2935, to be designated an incorporated town if it contains less than 300 registered voters, section 2936. They require notice specifying time and place of meeting and the proposed corporate limits, section 2937, and direct that 'the qualified electors present, being not less than two-thirds of those whom it is proposed to incorporate, and not less than twenty-five in number, shall select a corporate name ... for the municipality ... and designate by definite metes and bounds the territorial limits,' section 2938\n\n\n In 1892, in Town of Enterprise v. State, 29 Fla. 128, at page 145, 10 So. 740, 744, the state Supreme Court held that the statute did not permit incorporation of disconnected tracts of land, found a part of the territory proposed to be incorporated to be disconnected from the other part, and declared: 'An attempt to incorporate two distinct \n\n[302 \nU.S. 614, 616]\n\u00a0\n detached tracts of land, as corporate territory under one government, is unauthorized and void.'\n In 1926, electors residing in Dade county, Fla., on the west side of Biscayne Bay, incorporated a town, Miami Shores, now called North Miami. The boundaries specified by the incorporators included approximately 16 square miles, 14 of which were on the west side of the bay and had a population of 2,500. Two square miles were on the east side and had but 12 inhabitants. Though nearly vacant, these lands were much more valuable than all the property on the west side. The water separating the two areas is about a half mile wide. At the time of incorporation, construction of a causeway had been commenced, but its beginnings having been destroyed by hurricane later in that year, it has not been built. By land the distance between the settlement on the west side and the east side area is about ten miles, and to go by land from one to the other it is necessary to pass through another municipality. Petitioners own lands on the east side.\n Between January 1, 1927, and April 1, 1928, the town issued bonds, $ 238,000 of which are outstanding. In each bond the town pledged its faith and credit for payment and declared that provision had been made for the levy and collection, each year that the bond remained outstanding and unpaid, of sufficient taxes on all taxable property within its limits to pay principal and interest as they came due. But none of the bonds contained any statement indicating the boundaries of the town or in any manner representing that any part of the area on the east side of the bay was within its limits. The bonds were validated by decrees of the circuit court for Dade county. Sections 5106-5109, Compiled General Laws 1927. No owner of east side land was party to the validation suits and no question as to whether the town included any part of the lands east of the bay was there involved. Pro- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 614, 617]\n\u00a0\n ceeds of the bonds were used for the construction of permanent improvements; the only part spent on the east side was $6,000 for mosquito eradication, most of which went for equipment which the town still owns.\n In a quo warranto suit brought by the state on the relation of its Attorney General in August, 1929, and in a later suit brought by owners of east side lands to cancel tax certificates on their lands, the state Supreme Court held that the statute relied on for creation of the municipality did not authorize inclusion of noncontiguous areas. Mahood v. State, 101 Fla. 1254, 133 So. 90; Leatherman v. Alta Cliff Co., 114 Fla. 305, 153 So. 845. And in those suits it was finally adjudged that the east side was not and never had been a part of the incorporated town, and that the town never acquired jurisdiction de jure or de facto over the land east of the bay. A decree of ouster as to the east side land was entered in December, 1931, and tax certificates on lands on that side were canceled. No bondholder was a party to either of these suits.\n Prior to the quo warranto suit, the jurisdiction of the town over the east side was not challenged by the state, property owners, or others. And until prevented by the decree of ouster, the town exerted municipal authority on both sides of the bay within the boundaries defined by west side electors acting to incorporate the town. It laid taxes on east side lands, some of which were paid by petitioners.\n In 1930 respondent sued the town in the United States District Court for Southern Florida and got judgment on nine of the bonds. There was involved no question as to whether the east side lands ever were within the town or liable to be taxed to pay the bonds. In 1931 respondent brought in the same court a mandamus suit to compel the town and its officers to levy taxes on all the lands within the boundaries defined by the incorporators. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 614, 618]\n\u00a0\n Owners of land on the east side, including petitioners, were permitted to intervene. They maintained that the town had no jurisdiction over their lands or authority to tax them. The court entered a decree commanding the town and its officers to tax all the property within the town limits as originally defined. The town and its officers did not object to the decree nor appeal from it. The intervening east side owners attempted to have it reviewed in the Circuit Court of Appeals. The court held that, as the judgment was not against them, they had no standing to question it, and dismissed their appeal. Normandy Beach Development Co. v. U.S. ex rel. Brown-Crummer Inv. Co., 5 Cir., 69 F.2d 105.\n Then respondent brought this suit for itself and other bondholders against the town, its officers, the clerk of the circuit court of Dade county, and east side landowners, including the petitioners. It alleged that the town was unable to pay the bonds unless permitted to levy and collect taxes on east side property; that the town and its officers were ready and willing so to do, but were prevented by the decrees in the Mahood and Leatherman Cases, and that the clerk of the circuit court was bound by the decree in the latter case. It prayed an injunction to restrain petitioners from interfering, by use of the ouster decree or otherwise, with the levy or collection of taxes on east side lands for the payment of respondent's judgment and the outstanding bonds and to restrain the town and the clerk of the court from refusing to levy or to take steps required for collection of such taxes. The town and its officers answered and in effect joined in the prayer of the bill. Petitioners moved to dismiss, the court denied their motion; two of them answered. The parties introduced their evidence; the court found the facts and entered its decree substantially as prayed. Petitioners alone appealed. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that the town de facto included the east side lands. 5 Cir., 87 F.2d 978. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 614, 619]\n\u00a0\n That view cannot be sustained. This case differs essentially from those dealing with good-faith attempts to organize municipalities under unconstitutional enactments presumed valid until adjudged repugnant to fundamental law.

Mere inspection of the statute and the defined boundaries unmistakably shows that the west side electors were without authority to incorporate the east side tract with that in which they resided. Unquestionably, these were detached tracts within the meaning of the statute. The state Supreme Court having held that attempted incorporation of detached areas was unauthorized and void, Town of Enterprise v. State, supra, there existed no color of authority for the inclusion of the east side. The east side lands could not be brought within the taxing power of the town by the owners' acquiescence in its attempted exertion of jurisdiction over them and payment of taxes thereon that it in form laid prior to the ouster decree. The town de facto could not derive from the consent of the east side owners jurisdiction that it de jure was without capacity to receive. The consent of owners of land located beyond permissible limits of the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 614, 620]\n\u00a0\n municipality cannot be made to serve as would a statutory grant of power. Hayes v.

As the east side lands never became liable to be taxed by the town to pay its bonds, respondents were not entitled to restrain petitioners from defending against levy and collection of the taxes or to any relief in this suit.

Hunter, of Washington, D.C., and Melvin D Wilson, of Los Angeles, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. Edward J. Ennis, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n March 14, 1929, petitioner filed its income tax return for 1928. The return reported $137,007.17 as profit resulting from sales of lots in that year. That figure was arrived at by adding to the cash paid in 1928, on account of the sales, the amounts later to be paid, and by deducting from the total the cost of lots and improvements and expenses of the sales. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 191, 192]\n\u00a0\n In 1931 petitioner filed a claim for refund of the entire tax on the ground that the sales had been made on the installment basis, but the profits had been reported as if the sales were for cash, and that this was erroneous. The claim was rejected. Petitioner sued; trial by jury having been waived, the District Court made findings of fact and held that petitioner reported income as authorized by the Revenue Act of 1928 and applicable regulations, and thereby made an election which became binding on the expiration of the time allowed for filing the return. Accordingly it gave judgment for respondent. Upon the same ground the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 9 Cir., 91 F.2d 590. The decision below being in conflict with that of the Court of Claims in Kaplan v. United States, Ct. Cl., 18 F.Supp. 965, we granted a writ of certiorari. \n302 \nU.S. 679\n, 58 S. Ct. 281, 82 L.Ed. --.\n Under the applicable statutes and regulations, petitioner could have chosen either of two methods for the ascertainment and report of gain or loss on the sales. The Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, establishes both. Defining one, the 'deferred payment method,' it declares that gross income includes profits from sales, section 22(a), 26 U.S.C.A.  22(a) and note; regulates the computation of gain or loss, section 22(e), 26 U.S.C.A.  22 note; defines gain to be the excess of the amount realized over the basis, sections 111(a), 113, 26 U.S.C.A.  111 note, 113 note; and provides that the 'amount realized' shall be the sum of any money received plus the fair market value of property (other than money) received, section 111(c), 26 U. S.C.A.  111(b) and note. Regulations 74, art. 352. Defining the other, the 'installment method,' it provides that, in the case of a casual sale or other casual disposition of personal property for a price exceeding $1, 000 or in the case of sale or other disposition of real property, if payments received during the taxable year in which the sale was made do not exceed 40 per cent. of the selling price, the income may, under regulations prescribed, be returned on the installment method, section 44( b), 26 U.S.C.A.  44 note; i.e., the taxpayer may return \n\n[304 \nU.S. 191, 193]\n\u00a0\n in any taxable year that proportion of the installment payments actually received in that year which the gross profit realized or to be realized when payment is completed bears to total contract price. See section 44(a), 26 U.S.C.A.  44(a) and note.\n Regulations 74 permit the vendor to return income from installment sales on the straight accrual or cash receipts basis; when so reported the sales are treated as deferred payment sales not on the installment plan. Article 353. In ascertaining the amount of profit or loss from that class of sales, the obligations of the purchaser to the vendor are taken at their fair market value; if they have none, the payments in cash or other property having a fair market value shall be applied against and reduce the basis of the property sold, and, if in excess of such basis, shall be taxable to the extent of the excess. Gain or loss is realized when the obligations are disposed of or satisfied, the amount being the difference between the reduced basis and the amount realized therefor. Article 354.\n The question is whether, having filed a return according to the deferred payment method, the taxpayer by filing claim for refund is entitled to have the profit from the sales computed on the installment method.\n Petitioner contends that the installment method alone discloses its income from the sales of lots and that the deferred payment method failed clearly to reflect income.\n Conceding that its return might have been made in accordance with either method, petitioner says that, being ignorant of both, it treated the sales as if made for cash at figures mentioned in the contracts. Its argument, therefore, rests upon the assertion, which we assume to be true, that the promises of purchasers to pay installments were worth less than face value. But that fact has no bearing upon the question whether proper appli- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 191, 194]\n\u00a0\n cation of the deferred payment method would clearly reflect income for that method permits installments to be taken at market value and, if they have no market value, allows postponement of ascertainment of gain or loss until realized. While petitioner's return may have been an inept application of the deferred payment method, there is nothing in it or the statement of claim for refund that gives any support to the idea that, if rightly applied, that method would not clearly reflect income.\n The parties agree that, if allowed to change to the installment method, petitioner would be entitled to a refund in some amount. But that fact has no tendency to discredit the deferred payment method as inapplicable. The amount of the tax for the year in question is only one of many considerations that may be taken into account by the taxpayer when deciding which method to employ. The one that will produce a higher tax may be preferable because of probable effect on amount of taxes in later years. In case of overstatement and overpayment, the taxpayer may obtain refund calculated according to the method on which the return was made. Change from one method to the other, as petitioner seeks, would require recomputation and readjustment of tax liability for subsequent years and impose burdensome uncertainties upon the administration of the revenue laws. It would operate to enlarge the statutory period for filing returns, section 53(a), 26 U.S.C.A.  53(a) and note, to include the period allowed for recovering overpayments, section 322(b), 26 U.S.C.A.  322 note. There is nothing to suggest that Congress intended to permit a taxpayer, after expiration of the time within which return is to be made, to have his tax liability computed and settled according to the other method. By reporting income from the sales in question according to the deferred payment method, petitioner \n\n[304 \nU.S. 191, 195]\n\u00a0\n made an election that is binding upon it and the commissioner. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Commissioner v.

The Commission denied a rehearing with premission to apply for an increase of rates if, after a reasonable time, it should appear that a definite change in prices had occurred.\n In certiorari proceedings, appellant challenged these determinations and orders as unlawful and confiscatory, in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.

PUBLIC SERVICE COM'N(1938)\nNo. 705\nArgued: Decided: May 2, 1938\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Kentucky. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 209, 210]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. J. Brennan, and E. C. O'Rear, of Frankfort, Ky., for appellant.\n Mr. J. W. Jones, of Frankfort, Ky., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a final decree dismissing appellant's bill of complaint for want of jurisdiction in equity. It was entered by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky sitting with three judges under Judicial Code,  266, as amended, 28 U.S.C.A.  380. 21 F.Supp. 254. The appellant sought to enjoin the Public Service Commission of \n\n[304 \nU.S. 209, 211]\n\u00a0\n Kentucky from prosecuting an investigation of wholesale rates for gas marketed by contract in Kentucky by appellant, on the ground that any regulation of the rates charged by appellant to its customers would be beyond the statutory power of the Commission, since the appellant was not a public utility, and would result in a deprivation of property without due process, a denial of equal protection of the laws, and a violation of the contracts clause of the Federal and State Constitutions, affecting contracts entered into prior to the passage of the regulatory act1 of the General Assembly of Kentucky. As grounds for equitable relief, it was alleged that there was no adequate remedy and that irreparable injury would be inflicted upon appellant by the large expense entailed in preparation for the investigation.\n Appellant is a corporation solely of the State of Maine, engaged in the production and purchase of natural gas at various fields in Kentucky and the transmission of that gas through wholly intrastate pipe lines to distributing agencies at the 'city gates' of various municipalities of that Commonwealth. Appellant sells to three distributing agencies: A partnership, a corporation entirely free of connection with appellant, and a corporation in which appellant owns a dominant interest. It offers to sell and sells its commodity by separate contracts only to the distributing agencies named in the bill. All of these agencies, with one immaterial exception, are the owners of unexpired franchises purchased from the respective municipalities which they serve. Either by these franchises or by supplementary contract, the rates are fixed for retail sales of gas. Acting pursuant to statutory provisions authorizing investigations of the rates of defined utilities, the Public Service Commission of Kentucky issued on May 29, 1937, an order, pertinent provisions of which \n\n[304 \nU.S. 209, 212]\n\u00a0\n are set forth in the margin,2 reciting that appellant is an operating utility subject to the Commission's jurisdiction, setting a date for a public hearing, and ordering appellant \n\n[304 \nU.S. 209, 213]\n\u00a0\n to appear at such hearing and present evidence of the reasonableness of its rates and charges, and also to make its records available for examination.\n Appellant filed a plea to the Commission's jurisdiction, in substance setting up the objections subsequently urged in the bill under consideration. The Commission overruled this plea and reset the investigation for hearing on the merits. The appellant filed an application for a rehearing of this order. Though the Commission has not formally passed upon this application, it admits that it intended and threatened to proceed with the investigation, determine and fix a fair rate for appellant's gas, and that it would have so proceeded but for the temporary restraining order obtained by appellant upon the filing of the bill in question.\n Appellant's bill alleged that it was the obvious purpose of the Commission to lower appellant's rates; that these rates were not subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Commission; that any reduction would violate the Fourteenth Amendment, and impair the obligations of its contracts, in contravention of the contracts clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions, Const.Ky.  19; Const.U.S. art. 1,  10. It was further alleged that the investigation, and the orders entered therein, are unlawful and unreasonable, and, if further prosecuted, \n\n[304 \nU.S. 209, 214]\n\u00a0\n would put appellant to considerable unlawful and needless expense. The Commission filed an answer asserting that appellant was subject to its regulatory jurisdiction. It denied any purpose on its part to attempt to lower the contract price which appellant charged the distributing agencies but averred that it would institute and conduct a special investigation and proceeding to determine a fair and reasonable price or rate to be charged by appellant and to fix said price or rate.\n The majority opinion of the District Court held that, as the order challenged could be enforced only by judicial proceedings, there existed no immediately threatened irreparable injury or damage to the appellant within the equity jurisdiction of the District Court. Without any consideration of the merits, the bill was dismissed. The assignments of error attack this conclusion. We affirm the decree of the District Court.\n First.-The point is made by appellees that injunction is prohibited by the Johnson Act of May 14, 1934, c. 283,  1, 48 Stat. 775, 28 U.S.C.  41(1), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1). This act withdraws from the district courts jurisdiction of any suit to enjoin the enforcement of any order of a state administrative commission where such order '(1) affects rates chargeable by a public utility, (2) does not interfere with interstate commerce, and ( 3) has been made after reasonable notice and hearing, and where a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had at law or in equity in the courts of such State.' The Johnson Act does not apply here because the order complained of, i.e., that of May 29, 1937, was entered without notice or hearing. Though it is entitled a 'Notice of Investigation and Order to Show Cause,' which would be an appropriate method of initiating an investigation, in fact the order commands appellant to produce certain evidence on a designated date, and not merely to show cause on that date why evi- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 209, 215]\n\u00a0\n dence should not be produced. The order of June 29, 1937, overruling the plea to the jurisdiction, is not final but is pending on an application for rehearing.\n Second.-This proceeding was begun under the provisions of section 24( 1) of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  41(1), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1 ). Jurisdiction was challenged by the Commission on the ground that the value of the matter in controversy was not in excess of $3,000. To show the requisite amount, appellant alleged that it would be necessary to expend $25,000 to present the evidence required by the order. It was found by the District Court from the testimony at the trial that 'the expense to plaintiff of complying with said orders would be more than $3000.00 in employing appraisers, geologists, engineers, accountants, etc., to show the original and historical cost of its properties, cost of reproduction as a going concern, and other elements of value recognized by the law of the land for rate making purposes.'\n The purpose of this proceeding is to stop the investigation of the rates under the order issued. Since the necessary expense of producing the information demanded by the order exceeds the jurisdictional amount, the value of the matter in controversy is at least this sum. This purpose or object is analogous to those sought in injunctions to restrain a continuing trespass, where the value of the matter in controversy includes the cost of remedying the condition as part of the value of the matter in controversy, namely, the prevention of interference with plaintiff's rights. \n3\n Other examples are found in a suit to enjoin the enforcement of a tax statute, where the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 209, 216]\n\u00a0\n amount of the tax is the value of the matter in controversy,4 and in a suit to enjoin enforcement of an order to install and maintain a track, where the value of the matter in controversy is the cost of compliance. \n5\n Where 'expenses incident to compliance' with a regulatory statute exceed $ 3,000, the jurisdiction is clear. \n6\n There is no contention here either that the Commission's order left appellant with any less expensive alternative, or that the worth of appellant's entire business is less than $3,000. In undertaking to enjoin this investigation, the cost incident to making a showing required by the Commission is not collateral or incidental to the purpose of the injunction, but a threatened expense from which relief is sought. Whether such irrecoverable cost is an irreparable injury against which equity will protect is considered later in this opinion. The District Court had jurisdiction of the cause, as a federal court.\n Third.-We next consider whether the suit must be dismissed pursuant to section 267 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  384, 28 U.S.C.A.  384, which declares that no suit in equity shall be sustained 'where a plain, adequate, and complete remedy may be had at law.' Though this contention was not raised below by the Commission, 'either the trial court or the appellate may, of its own motion, take the objection.' \n7\n For determination of the adequacy of this rem- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 209, 217]\n\u00a0\n edy we must here assume the allegations of appellant that, unless an injunction is granted, irreparable injury will flow from its compliance with the order of May 29.\n It is settled that no adequate remedy at law exists, so as to deprive federal courts of equity jurisdiction, unless it is available in the federal courts. 8 If appellant ignores the Commission's order, action for recovery of penalties for the violation of the order may be instituted by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Ky.Stat.Ann., Carroll's 8th Ed., Baldwin's 1936 Revision,  3952-13 and 3952-61. But this proceeding could neither be begun nor removed to the federal court. Apart from the difficulty of maintaining such an action in the federal courts, in view of its penal nature, the State would be proceeding as plaintiff to enforce its laws; its complaint would not be grounded on the Constitution or laws of the United States, and there would not be diversity of citizenship, the States not being 'citizens' within the Judicial Code. \n9\n There is equitable jurisdiction to enjoin the proposed investigation of appellant's rates, if the order of May 29, quoted above, carries a threat of imminent, irreparable injury.\n Fourth.-The bill asks injunctive relief to restrain the Commission from further prosecuting the 'investigation' into the price of gas sold under appellants contracts to the distributing agencies. Two decisions dealing with \n\n[304 \nU.S. 209, 218]\n\u00a0\n orders for furnishing information have recently been handed down by this Court. 10 In both cases this Court dealt with the merits of the respective orders, determining that there was no constitutional basis for saying that 'any person is immune from giving information appropriate to a legislative or judicial inquiry.' Here there is no need to consider the validity of the challenged order. To justify the use of the extraordinary power of a court of equity something more must be involved than an application of a statute in an unconstitutional manner against complainant. There must be an allegation and proof of threatened injury under some of the recognized sources of equitable jurisdiction. \n11\n The one most frequently relied upon in constitutional cases, and pleaded here, is irreparable injury. \n12\n To furnish the information required by the order will cost $25,000, arising from the necessity of preparing for the hearing on rates. Is this irrecoverable expense a threatened irreparable injury which a court of equity will guard against by injunction? Whether or not equitable relief will be granted rests in the sound discretion of the court. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n It is true that the injury which flows from the threat of enforcement of an allegedly unconstitutional, regulatory state statute with penalties so heavy as to forbid the risk of challenge in proceedings to enforce it, has been generally recognized as irreparable and sufficient to justify an \n\n[304 \nU.S. 209, 219]\n\u00a0\n injunction. 14 The Commission urges that, since there is ample opportunity for the appellant to contest in a state court any effort to regulate or punish for disobedience of orders, with ultimate review by this Court, there is no irreparable injury, and that the dangers of lowered rates and threatened punishments can be overcome by opposition when an effort is made to enforce them. The case of Federal Trade Commission v. Claire Furnace Co., \n274 \nU.S. 160\n, 47 S.Ct. 553, where an effort was made to secure an injunction against enforcement of a Federal Trade Commission order to produce information, has been cited as a precedent. There were heavy penalties for violation of that order,15 but the opinion discussed the issues from the standpoint of failure to exhaust administrative remedy. \n16\n Appellant here insists that it is compelled to choose between compliance, at a heavy cost, or noncompliance with obvious risks of severe, though nonrecurring and noncumulative, penalties;17 and that to stand by sub- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 209, 220]\n\u00a0\n jects appellant to the further risk that the Commission will fix its rates on the Commission's evidence alone. \n18\n We may assume, without deciding, that the risk of these penalties would be sufficiently great to require the interposition of a court of equity to protect appellant against a regulatory order.\n Compliance with this order, however, subjects appellant only to an expense in preparing for and carrying out an investigation. It is not suggested that the expense is disproportionate to the business of appellant, valued by the District Court as in excess of $1,500,000, and involving sales of about one billion cubic feet per annum, at a price of $ 350,000. No order has been entered fixing rates or regulating conduct. The necessity to expend for the investigation or to take the risk for noncompliance does \n\n[304 \nU.S. 209, 221]\n\u00a0\n not justify the injunction. It is not the sort of irreparable injury against which equity protects. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n The weight to be given complaints of irrecoverable and irreparable cost and damage in proceedings to enjoin hearings, initiated by a federal governmental agency in a matter alleged by complainants to be beyond the agency's powers, was considered in Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., \n303 \nU.S. 41\n, 58 S.Ct. 459, decided January 31, 1938. In an effort to enjoin hearings by the National Labor Relations Board, the Corporation alleged (see 303 U.S. at p. 47, 58 S.Ct. 459, 462):\n'that hearings would, at best, be futile; and that the holding of them would result in irreparable damage to the corporation, not only by reason of their direct cost and the loss of time of its officials and employees, but also because the hearings would cause serious impairment of the good will and harmonious relations existing between the corporation and its employees, and thus seriously impair the efficiency of its operations.'\n\n Further allegations pointed out similar substantial damages in preceding investigations. See note 4 idem. While other grounds were factors in our conclusion to reverse the decree for an injunction, we said ( \n303 \nU.S. 51\n, 58 S.Ct. 459, 464):\n'Lawsuits also often prove to have been groundless; but no way has been discovered of relieving a defendant from the necessity of a trial to establish the fact.'\n\n It may be suggested that in the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Case the employer had not presented to the Board its contention of constitutional immunity, and that proof of that immunity would have constituted no greater injury if presented to the Board than the courts, whereas here the appellant has already been overruled by the Commission on the question of appellant's constitutional immunity, and so would be subject to greater expense by presenting further evidence on another matter before the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 209, 222]\n\u00a0\n Commission than by proceeding in an equity court and there contesting the Commission's jurisdiction. This was the argument presented to the Court, but not discussed, in United States v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 82, 85\n, 86 S., 37 S.Ct. 584. The situation is still controlled by the abiding and fundamental principle of this aspect of the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Case, that the expense and annoyance of litigation is 'part of the social burden of living under government.' \n20\n The authority in other courts is in accord. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n Fifth.-Our conclusion that this is not a threatened injury justifying intervention is strengthened by a balancing of conveniences. By the process of injunction the federal courts are asked to stop at the threshold, the effort of the Public Service Commission of Kentucky to investigate matters entrusted to its care by a statute of that Commonwealth obviously within the bounds of state authority in many of its provisions. The preservation of the autonomy of the states is fundamental in our constitutional system. The extraordinary powers of injunction should be employed to interfere with the action of the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 209, 223]\n\u00a0\n state or the depositaries of its delegated powers, only when it clearly appears that the weight of convenience is upon the side of the protestant. 22 'Only a case of manifest oppression will justify a federal court in laying such a check upon administrative officers acting colore officii in a conscientious endeavor to fulfill their duty to the state.' \n23\n The Kentucky statute in question contains detailed provisions for hearings and judicial review. \n24\n These include notice, procedural rules before the Commission, right to counsel, production of evidence, service of orders, rehearing, process for parties and witnesses, depositions, record of proceedings, review of orders by court and appeal to the state court of last resort. The compulsory and punitive powers of the Commission are exercised through judicial process. When the only ground for interfering with the state procedure is the cost of preparing for a hearing, there is no occasion for equitable intervention.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice STONE concurs, except that he expresses no opinion on the applicability of the Johnson Act.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Acts Ky.1934, c. 145, as amended by Acts 1936, c. 92. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Notice of Investigation and Order to Show Cause\n'Whereas, An examination of the reports of several wholesale and retail gas utilities serving in this state, show that they purchase gas at wholesale rates from the Petroleum Exploration, Inc., Lexington, Kentucky; and\n\n'Whereas, The Commission has found under Sections 3952-1-12-13, and 14 that the Petroleum Exploration, Inc., is an operating utility in the State of Kentucky, and subject to the jurisdiction of this Commission; and\n\n'Whereas, It is apparent from a comparison of these rates with those of other companies rendering a similar class of service in Kentucky that these rates may be excessive; and\n\n'Whereas, These wholesale rates bear a definite relationship to the cost of gas to consumers in the following towns and communities, namely, Corbin, Somerset, Barbourville, Manchester, Burning Springs, Richmond, Irvine-Ravenna, London, Winchester, Mt.

H. Thomas Austern, of Washington, D.C., and John B. Sutton, of Tampa, Fla., for appellants.\n Messrs. Wm. C. Pierce, of Tampa, Fla., and John L. Graham, of Tallahassee, Fla., for appellee.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Plaintiffs, engaged in the business of canning citrus products grown in the State of Florida, challenged by this suit the validity of Chapter 17783 of the Acts of 1937 of that State upon the ground that the statute violated the state constitution and also the commerce clause, and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, of the Federal Constitution, U.S.C.A.Const. Amend. 14. An interlocutory injunction was sought and a court of three judges was convened.\n Reciting that certain persons are engaged in importing into Florida citrus fruit and citrus juice produced and canned elsewhere, and in labeling the same in Florida whence it is sold, with the result that dealers are deceived and producers and canners in Florida are injured, the statute provides that every label upon any container of canned citrus fruit or juice shall show accurately the name of the State or country in which the fruit or juice was produced, and that every container used for such fruit or juice produced in Florida 'shall have stamped into or embossed upon the tin, glass or other substance of which such container is made' the word 'Florida', and it is made unlawful for anyone to use any container \n\n[305 \nU.S. 5, 7]\n\u00a0\n bearing the name 'Florida' for any canned citrus fruit or juice produced elsewhere. Section 2. The Florida Citrus Commission is authorized to prescribe the method of marking the labels and embossing the containers. Violation of the Act is punishable by imprisonment or fine, or both, and by confiscation of all goods misbranded.\n The Act was approved June 10, 1937, and provided that it should take effect immediately. On September 4, 1937, the Commission resolved that 'for the present' it felt that 'an educational and adjustment period' was necessary before the labeling provisions were enforced. On October 4, 1937, the Commission adopted regulations prescribing the method of stamping or embossing the cans.\n The bill of complaint set forth facts relating to the character of the trade, the process of canning and the trade practices as to labeling. It alleged that plaintiffs were without knowledge as to the authority of the Commission to postpone the enforcement of the labeling provisions of the Act and had no assurance from any enforcement officer that failure to comply therewith would not result in criminal prosecution or in the confiscation of products packed; that the 'classification, sorting and overprinting of both packer and private brand labels now on hand' would result in immediate increased cost to each of the plaintiffs in an amount in excess of $3,000; that as to the required embossing, the statute made no provision for the use of the tin containers not so embossed which the plaintiffs had on hand in a value in excess of $33,000; that these containers would no longer be usable in the packing of canned citrus products if the statute were enforced; that the embossing of the tin plate of the can would cause what is known as 'hydrogen flippers' due to action of the acid in the fruit upon the sheet steel underlying the tin plate through the weakening or penetration of the tin covering; that this would result in 'un \n\n[305 \nU.S. 5, 8]\n\u00a0\n told spoilage, swelling of cans, unmarketability and loss of products, loss of consumers' good will, and other damage', in an amount not presently calculable; and that the requirement of embossing would cause each of the plaintiffs a loss in excess of $3,000 because of the refusal of distributors to purchase and handle cans so embossed. The effect of the Act upon plaintiffs' trade was described in support of the claim that the enforcement of its provisions would inflict immediate and irreparable injury.\n Defendants, including the Florida Citrus Commission (which intervened) and other officials, filed answers putting in issue the allegations as to the injurious operation of the statute. They also moved to dismiss the bill of complaint upon the ground that it failed to state a cause of action. On the application for interlocutory injunction, the parties submitted affidavits setting forth facts in support of their respective contentions. At the same time the court heard the motions to dismiss. Injunction was denied, the motions to dismiss were granted, and a final decree was entered accordingly. D.C., 22 F.Supp. 575. This is a direct appeal from the decree of dismissal. 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380.\n The District Court made findings. After reciting the statements in the preamble of the statute, the court found that no sufficient facts had been shown by affidavits or otherwise to overcome the findings of fact so made by the legislature; that the statute was enacted in pursuance of the police power of the State and that all citrus fruit canners in Florida were affected by its provisions, without exceptions; that plaintiffs had on hand unembossed containers of a value in excess of $33,000 which would no longer be usable if the Act were enforced, but that 'such containers could be used for packing of vegetables or commodities other than citrus products' and that there was no showing 'thay they could not be exchanged with the manufacturer for properly embossed \n\n[305 \nU.S. 5, 9]\n\u00a0\n cans at little or no extra expense'; that if the practices and abuses as found by the legislature were not stopped 'the price which the producer of citrus fruit grown in Florida receives for his product will be greatly reduced' and he will 'ultimately be forced out of business'; that it did not sufficiently appear that the embossing of cans would be injurious or harmful to the citrus contents; that, 'apart from the conflicting affidavits, numerous embossed cans were produced before the court, some of which were used for canning citrus products and there was no showing that the contents of such cans had been injuriously affected by the embossing'.\n At the same time the court made an order restraining the enforcement of the statute pending this appeal, upon the plaintiffs giving a bond. That order recited that the court was of the opinion 'that the questions involved are novel and of great importance' and further that the plaintiffs 'will suffer irreparable loss and damage during said appeal' if the Florida statute is enforced and this Court should reverse the decree.\n We are of the opinion that the District Court erred in dismissing the bill of complaint. Plaintiffs did not submit the case to be decided upon the merits upon the bill, answers and affidavits. Defendants' motion to dismiss, like the demurrer for which it is a substitute (Equity Rule 29, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723) was addressed to the sufficiency of the allegations of the bill. For the purpose of that motion, the facts set forth in the bill stood admitted. For the purpose of that motion, the court was confined to the bill and was not at liberty to consider the affidavits or the other evidence produced upon the application for an interlocutory injunction. But the findings of the court indicate that that evidence, in part at least, underlay the final decree it entered.\n We think that the facts alleged in the bill were sufficient to entitle the plaintiffs to an opportunity to prove \n\n[305 \nU.S. 5, 10]\n\u00a0\n their case, if they could, and that the court should not have undertaken to dispose of the constitutional issues (as to which we intimate no opinion) in advance of that opportunity. The allegations of the bill as to trade conditions and practices, and as to the effect of the required embossing of cans, raise particular questions which can hardly be said to lie within the range of judicial notice. The salutary principle that the essential facts should be determined before passing upon grave constitutional questions is applicable. See Borden's Farm Products Co. v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 194\n, 211-213, 55 S.Ct. 187, 192, 193, and cases cited. And that determination requires a hearing in due course upon the issue raised by the pleadings.\n The decree is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n A Florida law designed to prevent fraud, requires that citrus products grown and canned in Florida carry the label, 'Made in Florida' and that containers of these products be embossed with the single word, 'Florida.' The majority do not decide that this State law violates the Federal Constitution. Nor do they decide that proof of the allegations of petitioners' bill of complaint will show that the Florida law violates the Constitution. While petitioners are held entitled to produce evidence, they are not held entitled to relief if they prove their entire bill. If on remand petitioners prove every allegation in their complaint, still- after time and State funds have been spent in taking evidence-either the District Court or this Court may decide that the complaint did not allege facts sufficient to invalidate the law. The the meantime, the State of Florida is forced to litigate the validity of its duly enacted law, with no decision on its \n\n[305 \nU.S. 5, 11]\n\u00a0\n substantial defense that petitioners' bill is wholly defective because of 'insufficiency of fact to constitute a valid cause of action'1 or 'failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.' \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n The important consequences of this remand raise far more than mere questions of procedure. State laws are continually subjected to constitutional attacks by those who do not wish to obey them. Accordingly, it becomes increasingly important to protect State governments from needless expensive burdens and suspensions of their laws incident to Federal Court injunctions issued on allegations that show no right to relief. The operation of this Florida law has been suspended. Complaints seeking to invalidate and suspend the operation of State law by invoking the 'vague contours' of due process3 can irreparably injure State governments if we accept as a 'salutary principle' the rule that all such complaints-though failing to state a cause of action-raise 'grave constitutional questions' which require that 'the essential facts shall be determined.' Under this declared 'salutary principle' specially applying to bills attacking the constitutionality of legislative acts, such bills must be defended against even though they fail to state a cause of action. This is contrary to the traditional general rule that fatally defective bills are dismissed on motion (formerly demurrer) in order to prevent needless litigation, delay and expense. \n4\n The application of this special prin ciple \n\n[305 \nU.S. 5, 12]\n\u00a0\n to bills attacking State legislation seriously undermines the historical presumption of the validity of State acts. \n5\n A refusal to determine whether or not the allegations of the bill are sufficient to strike down an act until evidence has been heard adds a special burden to the defense of State legislation, as though legislation were to be presumed invalid. I do not believe this principle leads to salutary results and I am of the opinion that we should now determine whether the allegations of the bill, if proven, would entitle petitioners to relief.\n The bill alleges that the Florida statute violates the Commerce Clause of the Constitution6 and the Due \n\n[305 \nU.S. 5, 13]\n\u00a0\n Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3, amend. 14. The court below held in the alternative that petitioners failed to make 'sufficient showing either by affidavit or by the allegations of the bill to uphold the contention that the Act deprives the plaintiffs of their property without due process of law.'\n Even according to the presently prevailing interpretation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, I do not believe that the averments of petitioners' bill can sustain invalidation of this duly enacted Florida statute. The statute contains a legislative finding that 'certain persons, firms and corporations in the State of Florida' had engaged 'in the practice' of deceiving customers into the belief that non- Florida canned citrus products had been produced in Florida. The legislature further found that this practice operated to 'the injury and detriment of the producers and canners of citrus fruit and citrus juices in the State of Florida; ...' and concluded that an effective method to prevent this fraudulent practice was to require the publication of the truth upon labels and containers. Averments of petitioners' bill, in their strongest light, go no further than to deny this legislative finding. They say to require publication of the truth in this manner on the cans and labels is burdensome7 and violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They further charge here that this finding of the legislature is a 'feigned' assumption and that 'the facts alleged (in petitioners' bill) not only show the nonexistence of any basis for such assumption but demonstrates that the law will cause serious injury to \n\n[305 \nU.S. 5, 14]\n\u00a0\n the packer and marked curtailment of the sale of citrus products grown and canned in Florida.' Petitioners' argument for reversal largely involves 'this disputed question as to the existence of facts concerning the basis for the law, and ... the preamble statement of the alleged evil which gave rise to its enactment. ...'\n Because, it is said, the embossing and labeling requirements raise grave constitutional issues, the State of Florida will be required to defend against two issues raised by petitioners' bill. The State must answer the charges: first, that-contrary to the legislative finding-there was no fraudulent practice under which the dealers in canned citrus products were led to believe that they were buying Florida products when in fact the canned goods were produced outside that State; second, that truthful labeling and embossing as required by the statute would financially injure citrus growers, producers, canners and the people of Florida rather than benefit them as found by the legislature.\n In attacking the legislative finding that the act would bestow benefits on the State of Florida, petitioners allege that the law would require petitioners to spend extra money for labels; might cause them to lose some business; would afford the opportunity for spoiling and swelling of some cans on the theory that embossing without spoiling is difficult and could weaken the tin of containers thereby permitting acid to corrode the steel underneath the tin; that petitioners will suffer loss because they have on their hands cans that have not been embossed; and that Florida already has laws adequate to protect itself from fraudulent sales.\n With reference to a State law regulating containers (for lard) this Court has already said:8\n'This may involve a change of packing by the company and the cost of that change, but this is a sacrifice \n\n[305 \nU.S. 5, 15]\n\u00a0\n the law can require to protect from the deception of the old method.'\n\n The real issue raised by petitioners' bill is not the cost incident to changing from the old method of labeling and embossing, but whether the Florida legislature-convinced that fraud existed-had the constitutional right to determine the policy which it believed would protect the people of Florida from that fraud. The cause is now sent back to a Federal District Court to review the facts underlying the policy enacted into law by the legislature.\n Under our constitutional plan of government, the exclusive power of determining the wisdom of this policy rested with the legislature of Florida subject to the veto power of Florida's governor. \n9\n This Court has taken judicial notice of the fact that citrus fruits support one of the great industries of the State of Florida and held that it 'was competent for the legislature (of Florida) to find that it was essential for the success of that industry that its reputation be preserved in other states wherein such fruits find their most extensive market.' \n10\n The legislators of Florida are peculiarly qualified to determine the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 5, 16]\n\u00a0\n policies relating to one of their State's greatest industries. Legislatures, under our system, determine the necessity for regulatory laws, considering both the evil and the benefits that may result. Unless prohibited by constitutional limitations, their decisions as to policy are final. In weighing conflicting arguments on the wisdom of legislation they are not confined within the narrow boundaries of a particular controversy between litigants. Their inquires are not subject to the strict rules of evidence which have been found essential in proceedings before courts. Legislators may personally survey the field and obtain data and a broad perspective which the necessary limitations of court litigation make impossible.\n The legislative history of the Florida statute under review indicates that it was given the careful and cautious consideration which regulation of one of the State's major industries deserved. \n11\n Companion measures were offered in the Florida House and Senate on the same day-April 28, 1937. In the House the measure was referred to the Committee on Citrus Fruits. The existence of such a standing committee is itself indicative of a legislative procedure designed to give careful consideration to legislation concerning this important industry. May 4, 1937, the House Committee voted to report the bill favorably, sixteen ayes, no nays, six members absent. June 1, the bill was made the special order of business and on June 2, the companion Senate bill previously passed by that body by a vote of twenty-four to one was substituted for the House measure and passed by a vote of seventy to nothing. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 5, 17]\n\u00a0\n In the face of this history, petitioners insist that this statute duly passed by the legislature and signed by the Governor of Florida violates the Due Process Clause as an unreasonable, capricious, unjust, harsh, and arbitrary measure. Therefore, if petitioners are to obtain relief on this theory it must be found that this statute was 'fixed or arrived at through an exercise of will, or by caprice, without consideration or adjustment with reference to principles, circumstances or significance'; or that it was 'despotic, autocratic (or) high-handed'; or that it is 'irrational, senseless' or passed by those 'not endowed with reasoning ability; non-conformable to reason'; or that it is capricious or freakish which 'denotes an impulsive seemingly causeless change of mind, like that of a child or a lunatic.' \n13\n\u00a0\n\n The cause is remanded for the court below to determine whether the legislative requirement that cans and labels to truthfully marked is arbitrary, unreasonable, capricious, unjust or harsh. This makes it necessary for the court to weigh and pass upon the relative judgment, poise and reasoning ability of the one legislator who voted against the law, as contrasted with the ninety-four legislators and the governor who favored it. I do not believe that obedience to this carefully considered legislative enactment would violate any of petitioners' property rights without due process of law or that-even under prevailing doctrine-the averments of the complaint indicate that no known or supposed facts could sustain it. \n14\n The allegations of the complaint in this cause raise no more than questions of policy for legislative determination, which the Florida legislature has already considered and which can be presented to other legislatures in the future. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 5, 18]\n\u00a0\n This case offers an appropriate opportunity to return to the wholesome principle stated by this Court in 1888, in Powell v. Pennsylvania, \n127 \nU.S. 678, 686\n, 8 S.Ct. 992, 996, 1257, in the following language:\n'If all that can be said of this legislation is that it is unwise, or unnecessarily oppressive to those manufacturing or selling wholesome oleomargarine as an article of food, their appeal must be to the legislature, or to the ballot-box, not to the judiciary. The latter cannot interfere without usurping powers committed to another department of government.'\n\n The majority opinion apparently does not decide the Florida has no power to require that the origin of citrus products canned in Florida shall be truthfully shown. \n15\n Petitioners' bill insists that Florida exercised its power so unwisely as to violate rights of property without due process, because, as alleged, canning frauds did not exist, and could be prevented by a wister statute, less expensive and burdensome to petitioners. Thus they challenge the wisdom of the Florida legislation. On remand of petitioners' bill which fails to show that the Florida law is invalid, may the Court, on evidence outside the bill, hold that the law violates due process because the court is convinced that the legislature might have chosen a \n\n[305 \nU.S. 5, 19]\n\u00a0\n wiser, less expensive and less burdensome regulation? If a court in this case and under this bill has this power, the final determination of the wisdom and choice of legislative policy has passed from legislatures- elected by and responsible to the people-to the courts. \n16\n I believe in the language of the Powell Case, supra, that since all that has been 'said of this legislation is that it is unwise, or unnecessarily oppressive to those' canning citrus products, that petitioners' 'appeal must be to the legislature, ... not to the judiciary.' I would affirm. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rule 29, Rules of Practice for the Courts of Equity of the United States, effective February 1, 1913. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Rule 12(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Cf.

In this suit, the validity of the order was challenged as depriving respondent of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. An interlocutory injunction was granted and the cause was referred to a special master. The parties stipulated for the submission of the cause upon the record made before the Commission with certain supplementary evidence. Following a hearing, the master on the basis of findings as to value, expenses and revenues, concluded that the rates prescribed were confiscatory and void. D.C., 13 F.Supp. pages 931, 932. The District Court expressly stated that it did 'not pass upon the factual exceptions to the master's report' and did 'not approve or reject his findings as to the fair value' of the property 'or determine the net income' which would result from the assailed rates, 'or determine what would be a fair rate of return,' but rested its decision 'solely upon the denial of due process of law by the Commission in fixing the rates in question.' D.C., 13 F.Supp. 931, at page 936. Rehearing was denied. D.C., 16 F.Supp. 884. On appeal here the decree was affirmed by an equally divided court. \n301 \nU.S. 669\n, 57 S.Ct. 935. Reargument was ordered (October 11, 1937), \n302 \nU.S. 771\n, 58 S.Ct. 3, 82 L.Ed. --, and has been had.\n The parties have not brought before us the evidence that was taken before the Commission or that was before \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 391]\n\u00a0\n the court below, with the exception of certain affidavits by the president of the respondent and the president of the Commission, respectively, in relation to the proceedings before the Commission. Respondent has in effect challenged the action of the Commission as invalid upon the face of its opinion and order. 39 Cal.R.Com.Rep. 49. Appellants have accepted that challenge.\n\n 1. \nRespondent seeks to sustain the decree upon the ground that the Commission's order was not authorized by the state law. Because of the federal question raised by the bill of complaint, the District Court had jurisdiction to determine all the questions in the case, local as well as federal. Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 175, 191\n, 29 S. Ct. 451; Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Garrett, \n231 \nU.S. 298, 303\n, 34 S.Ct. 48; United Fuel Gas Company v. Railroad Commission, \n278 \nU.S. 300, 307\n, 49 S.Ct. 150, 151.\n The state statute to which our attention is directed, section 32 of the California Public Utilities Act, Cal.St.1923, p. 837, set forth in the margin1 provides that whenever the Commission after a hearing shall find the existing rates charged by a public utility to be unjust, unreasonable, discriminatory or preferential, the Commission shall \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 392]\n\u00a0\n determine the just and reasonable rates to be thereafter in force. In this instance, the Commission's order shows on its face that the Commission found the existing rates to be unjust and unreasonable. 39 Cal.R.Com.Rep. p. 77. So far as respondent contends that this finding was not sustained by evidence, it is sufficient to say that the evidence is not here and we cannot say that the ruling lacked support.\n Respondent states that it was denied a proper hearing, but the record shows that the Commission held extended hearings, at which the evidence offered by respondent was received and its arguments were presented. \n2\n 39 Cal.R.Com.Rep. p. 51. While these hearings were in progress, and on June 16, 1933, respondent was cited to show cause why interim rates should not be put into effect pending the proceeding. Respondent stipulated that it would complete the presentation of its evidence before October 1, 1933, and that the rates which the Commission established in the proceeding might, if lower than the existing rates, be made retroactive so as to apply to meter readings made after July 16, 1933, and before November 15, 1933. That date was later changed by stipulation to January 1, 1934. 39 Cal.R.Com.Rep. pp. 52, 53.\n We have not been referred to any state decisions warranting the conclusion that the Commission did not afford a hearing in accordance with the state law. We turn to the constitutional question.\n\n 2. \nAs the District Court did not deal with the issue of confiscation and the evidence is not before us, we are concerned only with the question of procedural due pro- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 393]\n\u00a0\n cess, that is, whether the Commission in its procedure, as distinguished from the effect of its order upon respondent's property rights, failed to satisfy the requirements of the Federal Constitution. We examine this question in the light of well-settled principles governing the proceedings of rate-making commissions.\n The right to a fair and open hearing is one of the rudiments of fair play assured to every litigant by the Federal Constitution as a minimal requirement. Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n301 \nU.S. 292, 304\n, 305 S., 57 S.Ct. 724, 730. There must be due notice and an opportunity to be heard, the procedure must be consistent with the essentials of a fair trial, and the Commission must act upon evidence and not arbitrarily. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 33 S.Ct. 185; St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 38, 51\n, 73 S., 56 S.Ct. 720, 725, 735; Morgan v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 468, 480\n, 481 S., 56 S.Ct. 906, 911; Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, supra. As we have seen, the respondent was heard, the Commission received the testimony of respondent's witnesses, its exhibits and arguments. There is nothing whatever to show that the hearing was not conducted fairly.\n The complaint is not of the absence of these rudiments of fair play but of the method by which the Commission arrived at its result. As to this a fundamental distinction must be observed. While a fair and open hearing must be accorded as an inexorable safeguard, we do not sit as an appellate board of revision but to enforce constitutional rights. San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, \n189 \nU.S. 439, 446\n, 23 S.Ct. 571. When the rate-making agency of the state gives a fair hearing, receives and considers the competent evidence that is offered, affords opportunity through evidence and argument to challenge the result, and makes its determination upon evidence and not arbitrarily, the requirements of procedural due process are \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 394]\n\u00a0\n met, and the question that remains for this Court, or a lower federal court, is not as to the mere correctness of the method and reasoning adopted by the regulating agency but whether the rates it fixes will result in confiscation.\n We have recently had occasion to emphasize this distinction in passing upon an order of the appellant Commission in the case of Los Angeles Gas Corp. v. Railroad Commission, \n289 \nU.S. 287, 304\n, 305 S., 53 S.Ct. 637, 643. We said: 'The legislative discretion implied in the rate-making power necessarily extends to the entire legislative process, embracing the method used in reaching the legislative determination as well as that determination itself. We are not concerned with either, so long as constitutional limitations are not transgressed. When the legislative method is disclosed, it may have a definite bearing upon the validity of the result reached, but the judicial function does not go beyond the decision of the constitutional question. That question is whether the rates as fixed are confiscatory. And upon that question the complainant has the burden of proof, and the court may not interfere with the exercise of the state's authority unless confiscation is clearly established.'\n This controlling principle was reiterated, with due emphasis upon the necessity of a fair hearing, in the case of West Ohio Gas Company v. Public Utilities Commission, No. 1, \n294 \nU.S. 63, 70\n, 55 S.Ct. 316, 320, in these words: 'Our inquiry in rate cases coming here from the state courts is whether the action of the state officials in the totality of its consequences is consistent with the enjoyment by the regulated utility of a revenue something higher than the line of confiscation. If this level is attained, and attained with suitable opportunity through evidence and argument, Southern Ry. Co. v. Virginia, \n290 \nU.S. 190\n, 54 S.Ct. 148, to challenge the result, there is no denial of due process, though the proceeding is shot through with \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 395]\n\u00a0\n irregularity or error.' The statement is equally applicable, as the Los Angeles Case shows, when the order of a state commission is assailed in a federal court.\n\n 3. \nThe gravamen of respondent's complaint is that the Commission refused to consider the fair value of respondent's property and in fixing the rate base 'gave weight and effect solely to the historical cost.'\n Respondent supports its contention by referring to the statement of the Commission that during its entire history, 'to determine a proper rate base, this Commission has used the actual or estimated historical costs of the properties undepreciated, with land at the present market value,' and, consistently with that, the Commission has 'used the sinking fund method to determine the allowance for depreciation to be included in operating expenses.' The Commission gave its reasons why this 'historical method has dominated the Commission's findings.' 39 Cal.R.Com.Rep. pp. 57, 58. The text of this portion of the Commission's statement is given in the margin. 3 Refer- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 396]\n\u00a0\n ence is also made to statements of the Commission in its supplemental investigation in the light of the opinion of the District Court on the motion for an interlocutory injunction. 39 Cal.R.Com.Rep. pp. 198, 202; D. C., 5 F.Supp. 878.\n But it does not follow from these statements that the Commission refused to receive evidence of the cost of reproduction or to consider that or other evidence presented by respondent with respect to the value of its property. The contrary clearly appears.\n Respondent submitted to the District Court affidavits of its president setting forth its contention that no consideration was given to reproduction cost. This contention was combatted by an affidavit of the president of the Commission in which it is stated that the Commission gave careful consideration to all the testimony of record relative to value and to the testimony offered by respondent respecting reproduction cost. These affidavits are of slight value as we have the official opinion of the Commission stating the course which it pursued. That opinion shows precisely what the Commission has done in this instance. The Commission states, 39 Cal.R.Com.Rep. p. 64: 'Testimony regarding the cost to reproduce the properties here under consideration was presented by the company's valuation engineer on several price bases, all being developed through the application of price translation factors, and not through the application of appropriate prices to an inventory of the property. In each pricing period offered the estimate to reproduce was higher than the historical cost. For the first six months' period of 1933 the reproduction cost was shown as 8 per cent higher than historical. A perusal of price trend charts intro- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 397]\n\u00a0\n duced by the company elsewhere in the proceedings indicate that the estimate must be in error. It is not conceivable that a property, 80 per cent of which has been constructed in the high price period following 1919, could not be reproduced for a lesser cost under prices prevailing in the first six months of 1933. Witness for the city of San Francisco clearly indicated why the estimate was erroneous when he showed that the method used ignored certain factors tending in later years to decrease cost, such as improvement in construction materials and methods, increased use of mechanical equipment and a lessening in the width of the excavations and pavement cut. The estimates of cost to reproduce are not at all convincing and cannot be of positive value in this proceeding.'\n The Commission was entitled to weigh the evidence introduced, whether relating to reproduction cost or to other matters. The Commission was entitled to determine the probative force of resondent's estimates. That the Commission did so is apparent from both its statement to that effect and the reasons it gives for considering these estimates to be without positive value. The Commission compared them with other evidence and found the estimates to be erroneous. It found that 80 per cent. of the property had been constructed in the prior 'high priced period' and the Commission thought it inconceivable that the property could not be reproduced 'for a lesser cost under prices prevailing in the first six months of 1933.' These statements not only do not suggest but definitely rebut an inference of arbitrary action.\n There is no principle of due process which requires the rate-making body to base its decision as to value, or anything else, upon conjectural and unsatisfactory estimates. We have had frequent occasion to reject such estimates. Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 452\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.,N.S., 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18; Los Angeles Gas Corp. v. Railroad Commission, supra, \n289 \nU.S. 287\n, at pages 307, 310, 311, 53 S.Ct. 637, 644, 645, 646; \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 398]\n\u00a0\n Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., \n292 \nU.S. 151, 163\n, 164 S., 54 S.Ct. 658, 663. Whether in this instance the Commission was in error in treating respondent's estimates as without probative force, we have no means of knowing, as the evidence is not before us, but its error in that conclusion, if error there be, was not a denial of due process. Los Angeles Gas Corp. v. Railroad Commission, supra; Ohio Bell Telephone Company v. Public Utilities Commission, supra.\n Nor did the ruling with respect to the weight of evidence as to reproduction cost leave the Commission without evidence of the value of respondent's property. We have frequently held that historical cost is admissible evidence of value. For example, in the Los Angeles Case we said that 'no one would question that the reasonable cost of an efficient public utilities system 'is good evidence of its value at the time of construction,\" and that 'such actual cost will continue fairly well to measure the amount to be attributed to the physical elements of the property so long as there is no change in the level of applicable prices,' citing McCardle v. Indianapolis Water Co., \n272 \nU.S. 400, 411\n, 47 S.Ct. 144, 148. And we added that 'when such a change in the price level has occurred, actual experience in the construction and development of the property, especially experience in a recent period, may be an important check upon extravagant estimates.' Los Angeles Gas Corp. v. Railroad Commission, supra, \n289 \nU.S. 287\n, at page 306, 53 S.Ct. 637, 644. While the court has frequently declared that 'in order to determine present value, the cost of reproducing the property is a relevant fact which should have appropriate consideration,' we have been careful to point out that 'the court has not decided that the cost of reproduction furnishes an exclusive test' and in that relation we have 'emphasized the danger in resting conclusions upon estimates of a conjectural character.' Los Angeles Gas Corp. v. Railroad Commission, supra, \n289 \nU.S. 287\n, at page 307, 53 S.Ct. 637, 644, 645. And in the Los Angeles Case, with the evidence before us which had been \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 399]\n\u00a0\n taken by the Commission and by the District Court, we held that on that evidence it did not appear to be 'unfair to the company, in fixing rates for the future, to take the historical cost as found by the commission as evidence of the value of the company's structural property at the time of the rate order.' \n289 \nU.S. 287\n at page 309, 53 S.Ct. 637, 645. In the instant case we cannot say that the Commission in taking historical cost as the rate base was making a finding without evidence and therefore arbitrary.\n The decisions cited by respondent do not require a different conclusion. In Northern Pacific Railway Company v. Department of Public Works, \n268 \nU.S. 39\n, 43-45, 45 S.Ct. 412, 414, we said that the Commission's action in reducing rates by an order dependent wholly 'upon a finding made without evidence' or 'upon a finding made upon evidence which clearly does not support it' in the face of unchallenged evidence of probative value showing that the rates were already confiscatory, was an arbitrary act and a denial of due process. In so ruling, we fully recognized the principle that 'mere error in reasoning upon evidence introduced' does not invalidate an order. In Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n274 \nU.S. 344\n, 47 S.Ct. 604, 606, the Idaho Commission and the state court had refused 'to consider the evidence introduced by the carriers to show that the rates in question are too low and confiscatory.' In West v. Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co., \n295 \nU.S. 662\n, 55 S.Ct. 894, 900, upon which the District Court relied, the Court took the view that the Commission had based its action upon the application of 'general commodity indices to a conglomerate of assets constituting an utility plant,' and had resorted, on account of the wide variation of results caused by the use of different indices, to what the Court described as a 'rule of thumb corrective' by 'weighting the several indices upon a principle known only to itself,' and had substituted that sort of calculation 'for such factors as historical cost and cost of re- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 400]\n\u00a0\n production.' In that view, the Court thought that the Commission had acted arbitrarily, and hence that its order fell within the principle of the Northern Pacific Case. No such procedure appears here. In St. Louis & O'Fallon Railway Co. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 461\n, 49 S.Ct. 384, the Court was not dealing with the order of a state commission, or with a question of due process, but with the command of Congress addressed to the Interstate Commerce Commission in relation to its valuations of railway property. The Court construed that command and found that it had not been obeyed.\n\n 4. \nThe contention that the Commission failed to find the fair value of respondent's property presents substantially the same question in another form. What the Commission found appears by its own opinion. The court below was bound to go to that opinion to ascertain the Commission's findings. The Commission specifically found what it considered to be the rate base. 39 Cal.R.Com.Rep., supra, p. 76. The Commission found that rate base to be reasonable. Cal.R.Com.Rep., p. 77, note. The import of its opinion is that the rate base represented the Commission's conclusion as to the value which should be placed upon respondent's property for the purpose of fixing rates. It was upon that valuation that the Commission distinctly ruled that the rates it established would 'assure the Company a fair return on its properties.' Respondent was entitled to contest the value thus placed upon its properties, or any part of them, to insist that the value taken as the rate base was too low, and that in consequence the prescribed rates were confiscatory. That was the issue upon which the court below should have passed. But respondent cannot successfully contend that it was not heard by the Commission, that the evidence respondent offered was not received and considered, and its competency and weight determined by the Commission, or that the Commission did not place its valuation upon \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 401]\n\u00a0\n the property and fix the rates upon the basis of that valuation. Respondent utterly fails to show that in the procedure of the Commission it was denied due process of law.\n\n 5. \nThere is a further contention as to the burden of proof. But the applicable rule is clear. Respondent is in a federal court complaining of the constitutional invalidity of state made rates and respondent is held to the burden of showing that invalidity by convincing proof. Los Angeles Gas Corp. v. Railroad Commission, supra, \n289 \nU.S. 287\n, at page 305, 53 S. Ct. 637, 643; Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., supra, \n292 \nU.S. 151\n, at page 169, 54 S.Ct. 658, 665; Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n292 \nU.S. 290, 298\n, 54 S. Ct. 657, 651\n\n\n Respondent suggested in the argument at bar that the Court should direct the evidence to be sent up for the purpose of determining the points presented on this appeal. We see no sufficient reason for that course. The parties agreed upon the record to be submitted.\n The main issue in this litigation is whether the rates as fixed by the Commission's order are confiscatory. The District Court did not determine that issue. The District Court should determine it. The decree is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BLACK concurs in the reversal of the decree.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissenting.\n The District Court held that the Commission refused to consider the company's evidence of the cost of reproduction and failed to find the value of the property used to furnish the gas covered by the challenged rates. On that basis of fact, it was bound by our decisions to set aside \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 402]\n\u00a0\n the order as repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n This Court holds that the Commission did consider the cost of reproduction and that error, if any, in appreciation of that item of evidence would not be a denial of due process. But as to whether the Commission found or did not find value, the opinion is not clear. It states that the Commission 'specifically found what it considered to be the rate base,' found 'that rate base to be reasonable,' and that 'The import of its opinion is that the rate base represented the Commision's conclusion as to the value which should be placed upon respondent's ( appellee's) property for the purpose of fixing rates.' \n2\n If the decision goes on the ground that the Commission found and based its order on the value of the company's property, it rests on a fundamental fact without support in the record and contrary to the special master's opinion and the District Court's finding, which appellants do not here challenge. If the decision goes on the ground that the Commission based its determination upon historical cost, then it is directly contrary to our earlier decisions, and reverses the lower court for doing what they required it to do-enter a decree setting aside the order as having been made without procedural due process of law.\n As to value.-Since by legislation fixing their charges, public utilities are compelled to use their properties in the service of the public, due process of law requires that \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 403]\n\u00a0\n the rates prescribed shall be sufficient to yield them just compensation; i.e., reasonable rates of return upon the value of their properties. \n3\n The value to be ascertained is the money equivalent of the property, the amount to which the owner would be entitled upon expropriation. 4 It is elementary that cost is not the measure of value. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n In Smyth v. Ames, 1898, \n169 \nU.S. 466\n, at page 546, 18 S.Ct. 418, 434, the Court said: 'We hold, however, that the basis of all calculations as to the reasonableness of rates to be charged by a corporation maintaining a highway under legislative sanction must be the fair value of the property being used by it for the convenience of the public. And, in order to ascertain that value, the original cost of construction, the amount expended in permanent improvements, the amount and market value of its bonds and stock, the present as compared with the original cost of construction, the probable earning capacity of the property under particular rates prescribed by statute, and the sum required to meet operating expenses, are all matters for consideration, and are to be given such weight as may be just and right in each case. We do not say that there may not be other matters to be regarded in estimating the value of the property. What the company is entitled to ask is a \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 404]\n\u00a0\n fair return upon the value of that which it employs for the public convenience. On the other hand, what the public is entitled to demand is that no more be exacted from it for the use of a public highway than the services rendered by it are reasonably worth.'\n In Minnesota Rate Cases, 1913, \n230 \nU.S. 352\n, at page 434, 454, 33 S. Ct. 729, 754, 48 L.R.A.,N.S., 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18, the Court said: 'The basis of calculation is the 'fair value of the property' used for the convenience of the public. ... The ascertainment of that value is not controlled by artificial rules. It is not a matter of formulas, but there must be a reasonable judgment, having its basis in a proper consideration of all relevant facts. ... It is clear that in ascertaining the present value we are not limited to the consideration of the amount of the actual investment. ... As the company may not be protected in its actual investment, if the value of its property be plainly less, so the making of a just return for the use of the property involves the recognition of its fair value if it be more than its cost. The property is held in private ownership, and it is the property, and not the original cost of it, of which the owner may not be deprived without due process of law.'\n The principle applied in Smyth v. Ames, supra, has long governed wherever judicial action has been invoked to enforce the rule of just compensation. \n6\n It is binding upon \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 405]\n\u00a0\n state courts and commissions. But the California Commission refuses to follow the established rule. It does not ascertain or use present value but in its place takes historical cost, actual or estimated, as the basis of its determination in rate judging and rate making.\n In Rules, etc., of Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp., 1930, 35 C.F.R. 443, 445, the Commission said: 'This commission for many years ... has fixed rates to yield upon the historical or actual cost of the property, taking land, however, at current values and depreciation calculated on a sinking fund basis, a return somewhat in excess of the cost of the money invested in the property. ...'7\n So in the practice of the Commission, actual cost of all times other than land, which is included at its market value, comes to be called 'historical cost' which when found to be, or modified to make it 'reasonable,' is called \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 406]\n\u00a0\n 'prudent investment' or 'rate base.' \n8\n The Commission takes cost without regard to age of the items, changes in price levels, present cost to construct, depreciation, obsolescence or usefulness.\n In that case, Commissioner Decoto, dissenting, said, 35 C.R.C. 443, at page 474): 'The California Commission ... has clung ostensibly and theoretically to the historical rate base. In reality it has given effect to the different elements mentioned by the federal courts including fair value including going value by allowing a rate return between 8 per cent and 8 1\/2 per cent on historical cost if there be added to the historical rate base an amount between 10 per cent and 12 1\/2 per cent, the rate base so obtained will approximate fair value including going value. So, also if there is deducted from 10 per cent to 12 1\/2 per cent from a rate of return of 8 per cent or 8 1\/2 per cent on an historical cost rate base, it is readily seen that there is an actual return varying from 7 per cent to 7.75 per cent upon fair value including therein a reasonable amount for going value. ... During the last two years this commission has shown a tendency to cut the rate return upon an historical rate base from between 8 per cent and 8 1\/2 per cent to 7 per cent, which reduced the rate of return upon a fair value basis to 6.12 1\/2 per cent and 6.3 per cent.'\n While the dissenting opinion is not authoritative and may not be taken to express the views of the Commission, it usefully interprets and discloses the opinions, attitude and practice of the Commission as to ascertainment of the figure or base on which it tests existing and prescribes future rates. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 407]\n\u00a0\n In the case now before us, the Commission used the formula generally applied by it. Its report states, 39 C.R.C. 49, 57: 'During the entire history in establishing reasonable rates for utilities similar to this company, to determine a proper rate base this commission has used the actual or estimated historical costs of the properties undepreciated, with land at the present market value. ... This historical method has dominated the commission's findings for several principal reasons. It is well grounded upon established facts, is not subject to the vagaries of pet theories, unlimited imagination and abrupt fluctuation of current prices and passing conditions, and therefore indicates a truer measure of value. ... At the same time it prevents unwarranted demands upon the consumer through the projections of future rates on ephemeral values and stabilizes rates so that economic shocks from such changes are reduced to a minimum.'\n The Commission's figure show that it did not attempt or intend to find value. Historical cost was not fully disclosed by the company's records. A part was estimated. The company's total was $104,043,472; the Commission found $103,252,004. From historical cost ascertained by it, the Commission deducted 'Donations in Aid of Construction, $34,325,' added to the remainder 'Materials and Supplies, $638,828,' and 'Working Cash Capital, $773,300,' making a total of $104,629.807; and took the round figure, $105,000,000 as rate base. The Commission made no appraisal to ascertain value, as distinguished from cost incurred for the original plant plus additions and betterments through all the years of operation. The exclusion of 'Donations of Aid of Cosntruction' is inconsistent with ascertainment of the value, for obviously the worth of property is the same whatever the source of the title or the money with which it was purchased. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 408]\n\u00a0\n The report states that 'In this case a return will be allowed substantially in excess of the reasonably determined cost of money in order that there be provided a safety factor in accordance with the principles adopted by this commission to protect the financial structure as well as to allow for intangible values as well as to business development costs allowed in the operating expenses.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The Commission included nothing in its rate base to cover intangible elements of value. It said, 39 C.R.C. 49, at page 65: 'Even if going value could be found here in a definite amount there are no proper elements of physical value found to which it might be related to obtain fair value. Under the record there is no tenable depreciated reproduction cost figure and it is wholly inconsistent to attempt to relate going value to undepreciated historical cost.' This statement clearly and rightly implies that properly ascertained reproduction cost-condition and usefulness considered-indicates only the value attributable to the tangible elements and that to it there must be added the amount attributable to the intangible elements in order to find the value of both; i.e., the worth of the plant as a going concern.\n Having taken cost of physical elements, the Commission deemed it inappropriate to add anything to cover \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 409]\n\u00a0\n existing going value. It must have found that in fact a large amount was justly attributable to going value, for it declared, 39 C.R.C. 49, at page 65, that it would accredit the company with 'a reasonable recognition of going value through allowance as an operating expense of over $800,000 a year for development expense, which is approximately 7 per cent on the company's claimed going value figure, and by the additional allowance of return over reasonable cost of money.'\n But an allowance in operating expenses adds nothing to value or to return on value. It is not the equivalent of and may not be substituted for inclusion of an appropriate amount to cover intangible elements. Inclusion of an amount for development expenses increases deductions from gross revenue and so reduces annual net earnings, if any, by that amount, whereas the addition of $800,000 capitalized at 7 per cent would increase by over $11,000,000 the base on which to calculate return. The Commission's treatment of donated property, going value and rate of return shows that it did not find value, and that it intnded to and did adopt cost figures as the basis on which it condemned existing rates and ordered the new schedule.\n Immediately after announcement of the report the company filed a petition for rehearing, in which it directly charged that the Commission failed to find value, 'considered solely the historical cost and failed to give any effect to the cost of reproduction.' The Commission denied rehearing, but without in any manner suggesting that these allegations were not true.\n In this suit, the complaint alleges that the Commission failed to give any weight or effect to reproduction cost; 'that, in fixing the rate base, the commission gave weight and effect solely to the historical cost'; and that it prescribed the rates 'without any finding of fair value.' \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 410]\n\u00a0\n The answer is a studied denial. The defendants do deny that the Commission failed to give due weight to competent evidence of reproduction cost and allege that it gave proper weight to all the evidence, including evidence of reproduction cost; deny that the Commission gave weight solely to the historical cost; 'admit that in fixing and prescribing rates ... the commission did so without any specific finding as to 'fair value' ... but ... allege that in substance and effect the commission concluded that found in its said decision that the fair value of the used and useful properties before allowing for accrued depreciation did not exceed the sum fixed therein as a reasoanble rate base, to wit: $105,000,000.'\n The District Court referred the case to a special master. There was introduced before him evidence in addition to that submitted to the Commission. The record here does not contain the evidence, his findings or report. \n11\n But the trial court's opinion, 13 F.Supp. 931, 932, states that, 'While the master expressed the opinion that it appeared plain to him that the Commission used cost as the only measure of the rate base, itself offering no evidence on reproduction cost and rejecting that offered upon the subject by the company, he preferred not to pass upon the question of law thus presented, but to examine the whole matter on the merits.'\n In its opinion on temporary injunction D.C., 5 F.Supp. 878, 881, the court found that the Commission rejected the company's estimates of reproduction cost, did not have \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 411]\n\u00a0\n any detailed estimates of reproduction cost before it, and did not determine the reproduction cost of the property. Upon final submission of the case, the court found that the Commission on its own motion instituted the investigation and 'caused to be introduced evidence as to the past or so-called historical cost ... solely for the purpose of determining such past or historical cost as in and of itself constituting the rate base by which to judge the reasonableness of the plaintiff's existing rates and to prescribe new rates, and ... neither introduced nor caused to be introduced any evidence for the purpose of determining the fair value of the plaintiff's property or any evidence as to its reproduction cost. ... Plaintiff introduced evidence as to the reproduction cost of its said property and as to its fair value.' No evidence was introduced to rebut that offered by the plaintiff.\n'... On the conclusion of said hearings ... the Commission made its order ... finding that the existing rates of the plaintiff were unjust and unreasonable and prescribing lower rates whereby the plaintiff's income would be reduced by approximately $2,100,000 annually. In so finding ... the Commission declined to give and did not give consideration or effect to the reproduction cost ... or to the fair value of said property, but, except for lands constituting less than 5% in value of the property ... took into consideration for the purpose of determining the rate base ... only the past or historical cost.' The Commission applied for rehearing. Its petition indicates no claim that it did find value or that the court erred in holding that it did not; nor does the petition suggest that historical cost is value or was found or intended by the Commission to be the value of the property. Indeed it sought a rehearing on the ground that the court failed to find the value of the property.\n\n There is nothing in the Commission's statement as to the jurisdiction of this Court, Rule 12, or in its briefs \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 412]\n\u00a0\n here to indicate that it ever claimed or now claims that it found present value or that historical cost was not the sole basis of its calculations. Reversal is sought, not on the ground that the court erred in holding that the Commission failed to find the value of the property, but upon the claim that the court is without power to restrain the enforcement of the prescribed rates 'unless it be found that the enforcement of the order will result in the actual confiscation of the utility's property.'\n But that contention is directly contrary to our decisions. It may be taken as certain that if in truth it could claim that it did base its determination on present value, the Commission would rely on that fact, for then it would not be necessary to have overruled, distinguished, explained away, glossed over or disregarded the line of decisions rightly followed by the lower court.\n As to reproduction cost.-It is true that sometimes estimates of present cost of construction are not reasonably made and are therefore worthless as evidence of value. \n12\n It is also true that, when reasonably made, estimates of reproduction cost as of the valuation date constitute good evidence of present value. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n In S.W. Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., \n262 \nU.S. 276\n, at page 287, 43 S. Ct. 544, 546, 31 A.L.R. 807, we said: 'It is impossible to ascertain what will amount to a fair return upon properties devoted to public service, without giving consideration to the cost of labor, supplies, etc., at the time the investigation is made. An honest and intelligent forecast \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 413]\n\u00a0\n of probable future values, made upon a view of all the relevant circumstances, is essential. If the highly important element of present costs is wholly disregarded, such a forecast becomes impossible. Estimates for to-morrow cannot ignore prices of to-day.'\n In McCardle v. Indianapolis Co., 1926, \n272 \nU.S. 400\n, at page 410, 47 S.Ct. 144, 148, the court said: 'It is well established that values of utility properties fluctuate, and that owners must bear the decline and are entitled to the increase. The decision of this court in Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 547\n, 18 S.Ct. 418, declares that to ascertain value 'the present as compared with the original cost of construction' are, among other things, matters for consideration. But this does not mean that the original cost or the present cost or some figure arbitrarily chosen between these two is to be taken as the measure. The weight to be given to such cost figures and other items or classes of evidence is to be determined in the light of the facts of the case in hand. By far the greater part of the company's land and plant was acquired and constructed long before the war. The present value of the land is much greater than its cost; and the present cost of construction of those parts of the plant is much more than their reasonable original cost. In fact, prices and values have so changed that the amount paid for land in the early years of the enterprise and the cost of plant elements constructed prior to the great rise of prices due to the war do not constitute any real indication of their value at the present time.' \n14\n\u00a0\n\n The passage, which includes the statement quoted on the seventh page ( 58 S.Ct. 340) of this Court's decision just given, follows: 'Undoubtedly, the reasonable cost of a system of water- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 414]\n\u00a0\n works, well-planned and efficient for the public service, is good evidence of its value at the time of construction. And such actual cost will continue fairly well to measure the amount to be attributed to the physical elements of the property so long as there is no change in the level of applicable prices. And, as indicated by the report of the commission, it is true that, if the tendency or trend of prices is not definitely upward or downward and it does not appear probable that there will be a substantial change of prices, then the present value of lands plus the present cost of constructing the plant, less depreciation, if any, is a fair measure of the value of the physical elements of the property. The validity of the rates in question depends on property value January 1, 1924, and for a reasonable time following. While the values of such properties do not vary with frequent minor fluctuations in the prices of material and labor required to produce them, they are affected by and generally follow the relatively permanent levels and trends o such prices.' \n272 \nU.S. 400\n, at page 411, 47 S.Ct. 144, 148.\n The estimate of reproduction cost that the company submitted to the Commission in this case is not before us. It is referred to in the Commission's report but it is not disclosed sufficiently to enable this Court to decide whether it was made reasonably, was admissible in evidence or was entitled to any weight. This Court may not speculate concerning it. The record in this case and earlier reports of the Commission above referred to compel the conclusion that no estimate of reproduction cost as of valuation date would have influenced the Commission to modify or abandon the basis of historical cost.\n The Commission was bound by our decisions to ascertain and consider present cost as compared with original cost of construction. It refused to do so. The method it followed conflicts with fundamental principles established here in that it condemned the company's existing rates as excessive and prescribed lower ones without any \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 415]\n\u00a0\n basis of fact to warrant that action. When the state, acting thorugh the Commission, set aside existing rates and ordered lower ones for the future, it exerted power to take, or to compel use of, private property for service of the public. Due process required just compensation-rates sufficient to yield a reasonable rate of return on the value of the property used to furnish the gas. Without a finding of value it is impossible to ascertain the required amount. To take mere cost of physical elements, instead of total value, and to deduct development expenses from revenue instead of including in value the amount found properly attributable to intangible elements and going value, and then, because of that error, to fix a rate of return on historical cost greater than would be required on value, is to leave the orher without known or discoverable foundation. It is to make individual views as to what is just serve in place of the definite principles. The formula followed by the Commission prevents consideration of present value or of the estimated present cost, in comparison with the original; i.e., the historical cost of the property. The Commission gave no weight to the company's evidence of present cost of construction. It made no investigation to ascertain, did not attempt to find and would not use, present cost or present value. It seems to me very clear that, save merely to reject it as inadmissible, the Commission refused to pay any attention to the company's evidence of reproduction cost.\n The Commission having failed to find value, our decisions required the Disrict Court to enter the decree appealed from.\n In Nor. Pacific v. Dept. Public Works, 1925, \n268 \nU.S. 39\n, 45 S.Ct. 412, the superior court and the Supreme Court of Washington upheld an order of the state Commission reducing railroad rates for intrastate transportation of logs as against attack by the carriers on the grounds \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 416]\n\u00a0\n that the order was made without evidence and that the rates were confiscatory. This Court held the order would deprive carriers of their property without due process of law, upon the sole ground that the Commission found cost of service without any evidence, or upon evidence that did not clearly support the finding. We said, \n268 \nU.S. 39\n, at page 44, 45 S.Ct. 412, 414: 'The mere admission by an administrative tribunal of matter which under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings would be deemed incompetent, United States v. Abilene & Southern Ry., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 288\n, 44 S.Ct. 565, 569, or mere error in reasoning upon evidence introduced, does not invalidate an order. But where rates found by a regulatory body to be compensatory are attacked as being confiscatory, courts may inquire into the method by which its conclusion was reached. An order based upon a finding made without evidence, Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 263\n, 44 S.Ct. 317, 318, or upon a finding made upon evidence which clearly does not support it, Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R.R., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 32 S.Ct. 108, is an arbitrary act against which courts afford relief. The error under discussion was of this character. It was a denial of due process.' That decision was reached without regard to any question of confiscation.\n Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. v. Pub. Util. Comm., 1927, \n274 \nU.S. 344\n, 47 S.Ct. 604, presented the question whether an order of the Idaho Commission reducing railroad rates for intrastate transportation of logs would deprive carriers of their property without due process of law. On the carriers' appeal to the state Supreme Court, the action of the Commission was upheld. Following the state practice, the case was there heard on the record made before the Commission. The evidence introduced by the carriers was sufficient to warrant a finding that as to the lines of all the carriers, the intrastate log rates were low in comparison with rates on other commodities, and that as to two of the carriers they were confiscatory. But \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 417]\n\u00a0\n the state court held the Commission authorized to reduce the rates without finding them unjust or unreasonable. And, as to the carriers' insistence that the prescribed rates were confiscatory, it ruled that, even if the evidence showed existing rates insufficient, the prescribed lower rates would not necessarily be confiscatory, and supported that view by the suggestion that the intrastate haul from forest to sawmills was only one step in production and transportation to markets in other states.\n Writ of certiorari brought the case here. We reversed the judgment of the state court, and in the opinion said, \n274 \nU.S. 344\n, at page 350, 47 S. Ct. 604, 606: 'But, as appears from their opinions, the respondent (commission) and the court refused to consider and give weight to that evidence because, as they held, the intrastate log rates were not to be dealt with separately but were to be considered in connection with the interstate lumber rates, and because the carriers made no showing as to the gains or losses resulting from the interstate transportation. That cannot be sustained. ... This case is in principle the same as Northern Pacific v. Dept. of Public Works (\n268 \nU.S. 39\n, 45 S.Ct. 412 ). ... It is impossible to sustain the refusal to consider the evidence introduced by the carriers to show that the rates in question are too low and confiscatory. The commission and the court erred in holding that the reasonableness or validity of the intrastate log rates depends on the amounts received by petitioners for the interstate transportation of lumber. It is clear that the methods by which respondent reached its conclusion were arbitrary and constitute a denial of 'due process' of law.'\n In West v. C. & P. Tel. Co., 1935, \n295 \nU.S. 662\n, 55 S.Ct. 894, the company brought suit in the federal District Court for Maryland to set aside as confiscatory an order of the Maryland Commission reducing telephone rates. The controversy involved value, depreciation expense, and return. The Commission made no appraisal of the prop- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 388, 418]\n\u00a0\n erty, but attempted to determine present value by translating the dollar value of the plant as it was found in an earlier case, as of December 31, 1923, plus net additions in dollar value in each subsequent year, into an equivalent dollar value at December 31, 1932, its theory being, \n295 \nU.S. 662\n, at page 667, 55 S.Ct. 894, 895: 'Value signifies in rate regulation the investment in dollars on which a utility is entitled to earn.' After pointing out fundamental defects in the Commission's method of finding value, we held that the case was controlled by the principle announced and applied in Nor. Pacific v. Dept. Public Works and Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. v. Pub. Util. Comm., supra. No decision here has challenged the principle established by these cases. West v. C. & P. Tel. Co., supra, \n295 \nU.S. 662\n, at page 675, 55 S.Ct. 894, 899.\n I cannot refrain from protesting against the Court's refusal to deal with the case disclosed by the record and reasonably to adhere to principles that have been settled. Our decisions ought to be sufficiently definite and permanent to enable counsel usefully to advise clients. Generally speaking, at least, our decisions of yesterday ought to be the law of today.\n I would affirm the decree of the District Court.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS joins in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 32. Power to change unjust rates. Power to fix new rates. Preservation of adequate service. (a) Whenever the commission, after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint, shall find that the rates, fares, tolls, rentals, charges or classifications, or any of them, demanded, observed, charged or collected by any public utility for any service or product or commodity, or in connection therewith, including the rates or fares for excursion or commutation tickets, or that the rules, regulations, practices or contracts, or any of them, affecting such rates, fares, tolls, rentals, charges or classifications, or any of them, are unjust, unreasonable, discriminatory or preferential, or in anywise in violation of any provision of law, or that such rates, fares, tolls, rentals, charges or classifications are insufficient, the commission shall determine the just, reasonable or sufficient rates, fares, tolls, rentals, charges, classifications, rules, regulations, practices or contracts to be thereafter observed and in force, and shall fix the same by order as hereinafter provided.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The opinion of the Commission states that 'In all, 81 exhibits were introduced presenting in great detail the underlying data of this proceeding, and 3729 pages of testimony and argument were transcribed. Many witnesses testified upon various issues pertaining to a general rate case.' The opinion lists the witnesses on both sides. 39 Cal.R.Com.Rep., pp. 51, 52. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'During its entire history in establishing reasonable rates for utilities similar to this company, to determine a proper rate base this Commission has used the actual or estimated historical costs of the properties undepreciated, with land at the present market value. Consistent with this, it has used the sinking fund method to determine the allowance for depreciation to be included in operating expenses.\n'This historical method has dominated the Commission's findings for several principal reasons. It is well grounded upon established facts, it is not subject to the vagaries of pet theories, unlimited imagination and abrupt fluctuation of current prices and passing conditions, and therefore indicates a truer measure of value upon which, through the application of rates, a return may be allowed to reimburse the owner for his enterprise and insure the integrity of his capital honestly and prudently invested. At the same time it prevents unwarranted demands upon the consumer through the projections of future rates on ephemeral values and stabilizes rates so that economic shocks from such changes are reduced to a minimum.\n\n'It is an economical procedure, where the books of the companies are reasonably well kept, as obtains in practically all of the major utilities of this State, full compliance with which will prevent unwarranted expenditures of money by the Commission, the public and the company, which inures to the benefit of both the consumers and the utility. It is a more rapid procedure insuring quicker compliance with necessities as they arise.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Nor. Pacific v. Dept.

The Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming with modification a decree of the District Court, held that the agreement by which a lapsed policy is reinstated is a new agreement, as regards the effect of the incontestable clause in the policy, and that clause runs from the date of the reinstatement where the defense is fraud in its procurement; and, further, that the extended insurance under the policy in question was to be calculated from the anniversary date of the issue of the policy and not from the anniversary date of the payment of the first premium. 8 Cir., 94 F.2d 675. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 263, 264]\n\u00a0\n The District Cur t found that the policy was issued upon the joint lives of residents of Missouri and was applied for and delivered to the insured in that State. The Circuit Court of Appeals decided the questions, as above stated, as matters of general law according to the view of the court as to the weight of authority. Petitioners sought a rehearing upon the ground, among others, that the interpretation of the policy was governed by the law of Missouri. Rehearing was denied.\n While respondent contends that the decision below is not in conflict with the local law, it is not necessary for us to determine that question. It is enough to say that the questions to be decided are those of state law and should have been determined according to the decisions of the state court. Erie Railroad Company v.

Ruhlin presented a claim for total and permanent disability benefits under each of the five policies. The company tendered into court the sum of $1,045.42, the aggregate amount of premiums paid for disability and double indemnity benefits, and prayed that the disability and double indemnity provisions be rescinded, and for other relief not material here.\n The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the policies had become incontestable, since the suit was brought more than two years after the date of each policy involved. The 'incontestability clause' of each of the policies reads as follows: 'Incontestability.-This Policy shall be incontestable after two years from its date of issue except for non-payment of premium and except as to provisions and conditions relating to Disability and Double Indemnity Benefits.'\n The District Court overruled the motion to dismiss. The Circuit Court of Appeals, 3 Cir., 93 F.2d 416, affirmed the order, holding that, in view of their express terms, the incontestability clauses had no application to liability for disability and double indemnity benefits. It recognized that its decision was contrary to that reached by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (New York Life Insurance Company v. Kaufman, 78 F.2d 398), and by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (New York Life Insurance Company v. Truesdale, 79 F.2d 481), which had held that the exception in the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 202, 205]\n\u00a0\n incontestability clause related only to provisions and conditions actually set forth in the policy itself, compare Strochmann v. Mutual Life Insurance Co., \n300 \nU.S. 435\n, 57 S.Ct. 607, and that fraud was not mentioned in any of those provisions. Ruhlin petitioned for certiorari, asserting the conflict of circuits. The company filed a memorandum admitting the conflict, and raising no objection to the granting of the writ. Because of the conflict of circuits, the Court granted certiorari, \n302 \nU.S. 681\n, 58 S.Ct. 408, 82 L.Ed. --.\n It was stated in Carpenter v. Providence Washington Insurance Co., 16 Pet. 495, 511, that questions concerning the proper construction of contracts of insurance are 'questions of general commercial law,' and that state decisions on the subject, though entitled to great respect, 'cannot conclude the judgment of this court.' A limitation was put on this doctrine in Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, \n293 \nU.S. 335, 340\n, 55 S.Ct. 154, 156. Putting aside all questions of power, the Court interpreted a specific provision of an insurance contract in accordance with the decision of the highest court of the state of Virginia, where delivery was made. 'All that is here for our decision is the meaning, the tacit implications, of a particular set of words, which as experience has shown, may yield a different answer to this reader and to that one. With choice so 'balanced with doubt,' we accept as our guide the law declared by the state where the contract had its being.' The decision in Eric Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. --, decided April 25, 1938, goes further, and settles the question of power. The subject is now to be governed, even in the absence of state statute, by the decisions of the appropriate state court. The doctrine applies though the question of construction arises not in an action at law, but in a suit in equity. Compare Mason v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 545, 557\n, 558 S., 43 S.Ct. 200, 203.\n Had Erie Railroad v. Tompkins been announced at some prior date the course of this case might have been different. This court might not have issued a writ of cer- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 202, 206]\n\u00a0\n tiorari. Rule 38(5) of the Supreme Court Rules, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 354, indicates that this Court will consider, as a reason for granting a writ of certiorari, the fact that 'a Circuit Court of Appeals has rendered a decision in conflict with the decision of another Circuit Court of Appeals on the same matter.' Since jurisdiction to bring up cases by certiorari from the Circuit Courts of Appeals was given to this Court in order 'to secure uniformity of decision,' Magnum Import Co. v. Coty, \n262 \nU.S. 159, 163\n, 43 S.Ct. 531, 532, a showing of a conflict of circuits on a matter concerning which the federal courts had never denied their right to independent judgment prompted this Court to grant the writ. E.g., Aschenbrenner v. United States Fid. & G. Co., \n292 \nU.S. 80, 82\n, 54 S.Ct. 590, 591; Stroehmann v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., \n300 \nU.S. 435, 440\n, 57 S.Ct. 607, 609. As to questions controlled by state law, however, conflict among circuits is not of itself a reason for granting a writ of certiorari. The conflict may be merely corollary to a permissible difference of opinion in the state courts. The rules indicate that the Court will be persuaded to grant certiorari where a Circuit Court of Appeals 'has decided an important question of local law in a way probably in conflict with applicable local decisions.' No such showing was attempted by the petition. Nor was it contended that the decision below was 'probably untenable' and therefore probably in conflict with the state law as yet unannounced by the highest court of the state.\n No decision at the present time could reconcile any 'conflict of circuits,' or do more than enunciate a tentative rule to guide particular federal courts. Therefore, even assuming that it is adequately presented on the record, we decline to decide the issue of state law. However, we shall not dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted. In view of the fact that the question in the case was regarded below, both by the courts and by counsel, as one of 'general' or 'federal' law, the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 202, 207]\n\u00a0\n interest of justice requires that the judgment be vacated and the cause remanded for the enforcement of the applicable principles of state law. See Villa v. Van Schaick, \n299 \nU.S. 152, 155\n, 156 S., 57 S.Ct. 128, 129; Duke Power Co. v. Greenwood County, \n299 \nU.S. 259, 267\n, 268 S., 57 S. Ct. 202, 205; Watts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca, \n248 \nU.S. 9, 21\n, 39 S.Ct. 1, 3 A.L.R. 323.\n It is true that the Circuit Court of Appeals, in rendering judgment on reargument, said (see 3 Cir., 93 F.2d 416, 417): 'Furthermore, both the Court of Appeals of New York and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania have held that the incontestability clause here involved clearly excepts the double indemnity and disability provisions from its operation. Steinberg v. New York Life Ins. Co., 263 N.Y. 45, 188 N.E. 152, 90 A.L.R. 642; Manhattan Life Insurance Co. v. Schwartz, 274 N.Y. 374, 9 N.E.2d 16; Guise v. New York Life Ins. Co., 127 Pa.Super. 127, 191 A. 626. We have read the recent opinion of the Supreme Court of California in the case of Coodley v. New York Life Insurance Co., (9 Cal.2d 269) 70 P.2d 602, and the opinion of Judge Coughlin in the case of New York Life Insurance Co. v. Thomas, 27 Pa.Dist. & Co.Rep. 215, but are not persuaded that the learned District Judge erred. Since the company is domiciled in New York and the insured lives in Pennsylvania, and 'all that is here for our consideration is the meaning, the tacit implications, of a particular set of words,' 'for the sake of harmony and to avoid confusion' we shall follow the decision of those courts and hold that the insurance company is not barred by the incontestability clause from rescinding the double indemnity and disability provisions. Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 293 U.S. (335), 340, 55 S.Ct. 154; Trainor Co. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Company, \n290 \nU.S. 47, 54\n, 54 S.Ct. 1, 2.'\n It is not necessary here to consider whether, in the determination of the substantive Pennsylvania rule, the Circuit Court of Appeals was correct in declining to fol- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 202, 208]\n\u00a0\n low the nisi prius Thomas Case, directly in point, and in applying the Guise Case, which was decided by an intermediate appellate court (127 Pa. Super. 127, 191 A. 626), and not the Supreme Court of the state as the court below stated, and which involved a defense of coverage, available even under an ordinary incontestability clause as the opinion in the Guise Case clearly states (127 Pa.Super. 127, at page 133, 191 A. 626).1\n A different case might have been presented, and the facts and authorities developed in another fashion, if the parties had had in mind from the first the rule the Pennsylvania court would have applied. The pleadings might have shown in what place the policy was delivered,2 and perhaps other facts attending the making of the insurance contract. It may be noted that petitioner's brief asserts, without record reference, that the applications for the first two policies were made in Pennsylvania, and the application for the remaining three policies were made in Ohio. But as the record stands, we know only that at the time of bringing suit the respondent company was incorporated in New York, and lawfully engaged in business in Pittsburgh, and that the defendants were then temporarily living in Pennsylvania.\n Application of the 'State law' to the present case, or any other controversy controlled by Erie R. Co. v. Tomp- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 202, 209]\n\u00a0\n kins, does not present the disputants with duties difficult or strange. The parties and the federal courts must now search for and apply the entire body of substantive law governing an identical action in the state courts. Hitherto, even in what were termed matters of 'general' law, counsel had to investigate the enactments of the state Legislature. Now they must merely broaden their inquiry to include the decisions of the state courts, just as they would in a case tried in the state court, and just as they have always done in actions brought in the federal courts involving what were known as matters of 'local' law.\n The judgment is vacated and the cause remanded to the District Court, for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion, with directions to permit such amendments of the pleadings as may be necessary for that purpose. It is so ordered.\n Vacated and remanded.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Superior Court said (127 Pa.Super. 127, at 133, 191 A. 626, 629):\n'An examination of the clauses discloses that the disability provisions of the policies are expressly excluded from their operation. Even if that exemption had not been inserted, the clauses would not have prevented the interposition of the defense here set up. Mayer v. Prudential Life Insurance Company of America, 121 Pa.Super. 475, 184 A. 267.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Under the general doctrine the interpretation of an insurance contract depends on the law of the place where the policy is delivered.

We do not now determine which principle must be enforced if the Pennsylvania courts follow a different conflict of laws rule. \n\n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSANTA CRUZ FRUIT PACKING CO. v. NATIONAL LABOR R. BOARD(1938)\nNo. 536\nArgued: March 7, 1938Decided: March 28, 1938\n\n\n National Labor R. Board \n303 \nU.S. 453\n (1938) ]\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 453, 455]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Paul St. Sure, of Oakland, Cal., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 453, 457]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles Fahy, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 453, 460]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The National Labor Relations Board on April 2, 1936, after hearing, found that petitioner, Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Company, a California corporation, had been engaged in unfair labor practices affecting commerce within the meaning of section 8, subdivisions (1) and (3) and section 2, subdivisions (6) and (7), of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A .  158(1, 3), 152(6, 7), and ordered petitioner to desist from such practices, to reinstate with back pay certain employees who had been discharged, and to post appropriate notices. 1 N.L.R.B. 454. Upon petition of the Board, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the order so far as it related to petitioner's employees at its Oakland plant. 9 Cir., 91 F.2d 790. In view of the importance of the question with respect to the application of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., this court granted certiorari. \n302 \nU.S. 680\n, 58 S.Ct. 282, 82 L.Ed. --.\n There is no dispute as to the pertinent facts. The findings of the Board, supported by evidence, show the following:\n Petitioner is engaged at its plant at Oakland in canning, packing, and shipping fruit and vegetables, the bulk of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 453, 461]\n\u00a0\n which are grown in that state. During the 'peak' season, petitioner employs from 1,200 to 1,500 persons, of whom about 30 are warehousemen. The total 'pack' in the year 1935 amounted to about 1,699,270 cases. Of this amount about 37 per cent. were shipped in interstate or foreign commerce, 9.02 per cent. being sent to foreign countries and approximately 473,620 cases, or about 27.89 per cent. to various points in the United States outside California. The sales to purchasers outside the state were under either f.o.b. or c.i.f. San Francisco Bay Point contracts.\n The methods of transportation are by water, rail, and truck. Export shipments go by water, and this is also the chief sort of carriage to points within the United States outside California; about 20 per cent. being shipped by rail and an undetermined amount by truck directly to the point of destination. 'There is a constant stream of loading and shipping of products' out of petitioner's plant throughout the entire year. From 3, 000 to 4,000 cases are loaded daily in the various vehicles of conveyance. That loading is a substantial and regular part of the work of the warehousemen in petitioner's employ. When the shipments are by rail or overland trucks, these employees load directly into the equipment of the principal carriers. When shipments are by boat, the warehousemen load the cases into the trucks which carry the goods to the docks.\n Weighers, Warehousemen and Cereal Workers Local 38-44, International Longshoremen's Association, is a labor organization affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. Its efforts to organize the Oakland plant were begun in July, 1935, and many of the permanent warehousemen made application for membership. When this came to the attention of petitioner early in August, the general manager announced that he would not permit a union in the plant because of competitive conditions. On their return from a union meeting at which the men \n\n[303 \nU.S. 453, 462]\n\u00a0\n were to be initiated, members of the night shift were prevented from entering the plant, and the next morning the members of the day crew were similarly excluded. A picket line then formed, on the morning of August 8th, was maintained until September 27th with such effectiveness that eventually the movement of trucks from warehouses to wharves ceased entirely. The Board found: 'The teamsters refused to haul Santa Cruz merchandise; the warehousemen at the dock warehouses who ordinarily unload the canned goods from the cars prior to their reloading into the ships, since they were members of the same union as the Santa Cruz warehousemen, also declined to handle Santa Cruz cargo. As members of the sister union, I.L.A. 38-79, the stevedores who move the goods from dock to ship also refused to move Santa Cruz cargo both at the East Bay and San Francisco docks during the entire period that the picket line was maintained. Other unions whose members refused to move 'hot' Santa Cruz cargo were those members of the Sailors who comprised the crews of steam schooners and whose duties include the handling of cargo.' Petitioner points out that the refusal of the other unions to handle petitioner's goods was a violation of an arbitration award made in October, 1934, following the San Francisco maritime strike of that year.\n The Board found that interference with the activities of employees in forming or joining labor organizations results in strikes and industrial unrest which habitually have had the effect in the canning industry of impeding the movement of canned products in interstate and foreign commerce. Reference was made to official statistics of the United States Department of Labor in relation to the canning and preserving industries from which it appeared that of the fifteen strikes and lockouts in 1934, and the first six months of 1935, eight were the outcome of difficulties in regard to union recognition and discrimi- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 453, 463]\n\u00a0\n nation for union activities; 7,484 workers being involved in those stoppages.\n The Board concluded that the discharge of the employees named and the refusal to reinstate them constituted an unlawful discrimination under the National Labor Relations Act and that the acts of petitioner had led and tended to lead to labor disputes burdening and obstructing commerce.\n Petitioner contends that the manufacturing and processing in which petitioner is engaged are local activities, and that the Board was without jurisdiction over the labor dispute involved in this case.\n First. There is no question that petitioner was directly and largely engaged in interstate and foreign commerce. We have often decided that sales to purchasers in another state are not withdrawn from federal control because the goods are delivered f.o.b. at stated points within the state of origin for transportation. See Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 520\n, 32 S.Ct. 715; Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co., \n227 \nU.S. 111, 114\n, 122 S., 33 S.Ct. 229; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Clark Bros. Coal Mining Co., \n238 \nU.S. 456\n, 465-468, 35 S.Ct. 896. A large part of the interstate commerce of the country is conducted upon the basis and the arrangements that are made between seller and purchaser with respect to the place of taking title to the commodity, or as to the payment of freight, where the actual movement is interstate, does not affect either the power of Congress or the jurisdiction of the agencies which Congress has established. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Clark Bros. Coal Mining Co., supra.\n Second. The power of Congress extends not only to the making of rules governing sales of petitioner's products in interstate commerce, as, for example, with respect to misbranding under the Federal Food and Drugs Act, 21 U.S.C.  1 to 26, 21 U.S.C.A.  1 to 26, or with respect to forbidden dis- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 453, 464]\n\u00a0\n criminations in prices under the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  13, 15 U.S.C.A.  13, but also to the protection of that interstate commerce from burdens, obstructions, and interruptions, whatever may be their source. Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 51\n, 32 S.Ct. 169, 38 L.R.A.,N.S., 44. The close and intimate effect which brings the subject within the reach of federal power may be due to activities in relation to productive industry, although that industry when separately viewed is local. It is upon this well-established principle that the constitutional validity of the National Labor Relations Act has been sustained. National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, \n301 \nU.S. 1, 38\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 624, 108 A.L.R. 1352\n\n\n Petitioner urges that the principle is inapplicable here as the fruits and vegetables which petitioner prepares for shipment are grown in California and petitioner's operations are confined to that state. It is not a case where the raw materials of production are brought into the state of manufacture and the manufactured product is handled by the manufacturer in other states. In view of the interstate commerce actually carried on by petitioner, the conclusion sought to be drawn from this distinction is without merit. The existence of a continuous flow of interstate commerce through the state may indeed readily show the intimate relation of particular transactions to that commerce. Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495, 516\n, 42 S.Ct. 397, 402, 23 A.L.R. 229; Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen, \n262 \nU.S. 1, 33\n, 43 S.Ct. 470, 476. But, as we said in the Jones & Laughlin Case, the instances in which the metaphor of a 'stream of commerce' has been used are but particular, and not exclusive, illustrations of the protective power which Congress may exercise. 'The congressional authority to protect interstate commerce from burdens and obstructions is not limited to transactions which can be deemed to be an essential part of a 'flow' of interstate or foreign commerce. Burdens and obstructions may be due to injurious actions springing from other sources.' Id., \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, at page 36, 57 S.Ct. 615, 624, 108 A.L.R. 1352. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 453, 465]\n\u00a0\n Such injurious action burdening and obstructing interstate trade in manufactured articles may spring from labor disputes irrespective of the origin of the materials used in the manufacturing process. And the place where the manufacturer makes his sales is not controlling if the sales in fact are in interstate commerce. A few illustrations, from our many decisions, will suffice. In Loewe v. Lawlor, 1908, \n208 \nU.S. 274, 302\n, 28 S. Ct. 301, 13 Ann.Cas. 815, the conspiracy of the 'United Hatters,' to compel the plaintiffs to unionize their factory, was held to fall within the Federal Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., because it was aimed at the destruction of the interstate trade in the manufactured hats. In United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., 1922, \n259 \nU.S. 344, 407\n, 408 S., 42 S.Ct. 570, 582, 27 A.L.R. 762, the Court said that 'Coal mining is not interstate commerce, and the power of Congress does not extend to its regulation as such,' but that, 'if Congress deems certain recurring practices though not really part of interstate commerce, likely to obstruct, restrain or burden it, it has the power to subject them to national supervision and restraint.' And in the second Coronado Case, 1925, \n268 \nU.S. 295, 310\n, 45 S.Ct. 551, 556, the Court held that the evidence was adequate to show that the purpose was to stop the production of nonunion coal and prevent its shipment to markets of other states, and that a combination to that end would constitute a direct violation of the Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq. Another illustration is found in Bedford Cut Stone Company v. Journeyman Stone Cutters' Association, 1927, \n274 \nU.S. 37, 48\n, 47 S.Ct. 522, 525, 54 A.L.R. 791, where a conspiracy of stonecutters was held to have 'the immediate purpose and necessary effect of restraining future sales and shipments in interstate commerce' of the building stone which was quarried at petitioners' plants.\n With respect to the federal power to protect interstate commerce in the commodities produced, there is obviously no difference between coal mined, or stone quarried, and fruit and vegetables grown. The same principle must apply, and has been applied, to injurious restraints of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 453, 466]\n\u00a0\n interstate trade which are caused by the practices of manufacturers and processors. Standard Oil Company v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, 31 S.Ct. 502, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734; United States v. American Tobacco Company, \n221 \nU.S. 106\n, 31 S.Ct. 632. The case of Carter v. Carter Coal Company, \n298 \nU.S. 238\n, 56 S.Ct. 855, did not establish a different principle or overrule the decisions which we have cited. See National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, supra, \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, at page 41, 57 S.Ct. 615, 626, 108 A.L.R. 1352. Nor are the cases in point which are cited by petitioner with respect to the exercise of the power of the state to tax goods, which have not begun to move in interstate commerce or have come to rest within the state, or to adopt police measures as to local matters. In that class of cases the question is not with respect to the extent of the power of Congress to protect interstate commerce, but whether a particular exercise of state power in view of its nature and operation must be deemed to be in conflict with that paramount authority. Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 \nU.S. 504, 516\n, 33 S.Ct. 299; Stafford v. Wallace, supra, \n258 \nU.S. 495\n, at page 526, 42 S.Ct. 397, 405, 23 A.L.R. 229; Minnesota v. Blasius, \n290 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 54 S.Ct. 34, 36.\n Third. It is also clear that where federal control is sought to be exercised over activities which separately considered are intrastate, it must appear that there is a close and substantial relation to interstate commerce in order to justify the federal intervention for its protection. However difficult in application, this principle is essential to the maintenance of our constitutional system. The subject of federal power is still 'commerce,' and not all commerce but commerce with foreign nations and among the several states. The expansion of enterprise has vastly increased the interests of interstate commerce, but the constitutional differentiation still obtains. Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495, 546\n, 55 S.Ct. 837, 850, 97 A.L.R. 947. 'Activities local in their immediacy do not become interstate and national because of distant repercussions.' Id., \n295 \nU.S. 495\n, at page 554, 55 S.Ct. 837, 853, 97 A.L.R. 947.\n To express this essential distinction, 'direct' has been contrasted with 'indirect,' and what is 'remote' or 'dis- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 453, 467]\n\u00a0\n tant' with what is 'close and substantial.' Whatever terminology is used, the criterion is necessarily one of degree and must be so defined. This does not satisfy those wo seek for mathematical or rigid formulas. But such formulas are not provided by the great concepts of the Constitution such as 'interstate commerce,' 'due process,' 'equal protection.' In maintaining the balance of the constitutional grants and limitations, it is inevitable that we should define their applications in the gradual process of inclusion and exclusion.\n There is thus no point in the instant case in a demand for the drawing of a mathematical line. And what is reasonably clear in a particular application is not to be overborne by the simple and familiar dialectic of suggesting doubtful and extreme cases. The critical words of the provision of the National Labor Relations Act in dealing with the described labor practices are 'affecting commerce,' as defined. Section 2( 7), 29 U.S.C.A.  152(7). It is plain that the provision cannot be applied by a mere reference to percentages, and the fact that petiioner's sales in interstate and foreign commerce amounted to 37 per cent., and not to more than 50 per cent., of its production cannot be deemed controlling. The question that must be faced under the act upon particular facts is whether the unfair labor practices involved have such a close and substantial relation to the freedom of interstate commerce from injurious restraint that these practices may constitutionally be made the subject of federal cognizance through provisions looking to the peaceable adjustment of labor disputes.\n The question of degree is constantly met in other relations.

The Shreveport Case, \n234 \nU.S. 342, 351\n, 34 S.Ct. 833. It is met under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, where the question is whether the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 453, 468]\n\u00a0\n employee's occupation at the time of his injury is 'in interstate transportation, or in work so closely related to such transportation as to be practically a part of it.'

The direct relation of the labor practices and the resulting labor dispute in the instant case to interstate commerce and the injurious effect upon that commerce are fully established. The warehousemen in question were employed by petitioner in loading its goods either into the cars of carriers or into the trucks which transported the goods to the docks for shipment abroad or to other states. The immediacy of the effect of the forbidden discrimination against these warehousemen is strikingly shown by the findings of the Board. When the men found themselves locked out because of their joining the union, they at once formed a picket line, and this was maintained with such effectiveness that eventually 'the movement of trucks from warehouse to wharves ceased entirely.' The teamsters refused to haul, the warehousemen at the dock warehouses declined to handle, and the stevedores between dock and ship refused to load, petitioner's goods. These became, in the parlance of the men, 'hot' cargo. Petitioner says that this was an unlawful conspiracy of those sympathizing with its discharged warehousemen, but it was the discrimination against them which led directly to the interference \n\n[303 \nU.S. 453, 469]\n\u00a0\n with the movement from the plant and elicited the support so effectively given.\n It would be difficult to find a case in which unfair labor practices had a more direct effect upon interstate and foreign commerce.\n The relief afforded by the Board, in requiring petitioner to desist from the unfair labor practices condemned by the act and to reinstate the discharged employees with back pay, was properly sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and its order is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER (dissenting).\n Carter v. Carter Coal Co., \n298 \nU.S. 238\n, 56 S.Ct. 855, decided that Congress lacks power to regulate terms and conditions of employment of those engaged in local production of commodities sold and about to be shipped in interstate commerce. The Circuit Court of Appeals found two questions for solution. One was whether upon that point the Carter Case, in 1936, has been overruled by our decision in 1937 in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 108 A.L.R. 1352. The second was whether the power extends to cases where only 39 per cent. of goods locally produced are shipped in interstate commerce. The court, one judge dissenting, upheld the order. Each of the judges wrote an opinion; two held this Court has overruled the Carter Case.\n If the decision of the Carter Case upon the point stated stands, the Board's order cannot be upheld. The lower court made its decision depend upon that question. Save authoritatively to decide it here, there was no reason for granting the writ. But the opinion just announced does not refer to the question. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 453, 470]\n\u00a0\n In the Jones & Laughlin and companion cases, National Labor Relations Board v. Fruehauf Trailer Co., \n301 \nU.S. 49\n, 57 S.Ct. 642, 630, 108 A.L.R. 1352, National Labor Relations Board v. Friedman-Harry Marks Clothing Co., \n301 \nU.S. 58\n, 57 S.Ct. 645, 630, 108 A.L. R. 1352, Associated Press v. National Labor Relation's Board, \n301 \nU.S. 103\n, 57 S.Ct. 650, Washington, Virginia & Maryland Coach Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n301 \nU.S. 142\n, 57 S.Ct. 648, four dissenting Justices thought the Court then departed from well- established principles followed in the Carter Case, and quoted (page 96 of 301 U.S., page 638 of 57 S.Ct.) a passage from it expounding what it meant by 'direct' effect on interstate commerce as distinguished from what is 'indirect.' And the dissenting opinion insisted (page 97 of 301 U.S., page 639 of 57 S.Ct.) that, under the Carter decision, the facts in those cases did not disclose any direct effect upon interstate commerce, and said: 'A more remote and indirect interference with interstate commerce or a more definite invasion of the powers reserved to the states is difficult, if not impossible, to imagine.'\n But the dissent failed to elicit from the Court any statement as to whether it meant to overrule the Carter Case. The opinion does not discuss that case. It does, however, contain the following (page 41 of 301 U.S., page 626 of 57 S.Ct.): 'In the Carter Case ... the Court was of the opinion that the provisions of the statute relating to production were invalid upon several grounds,-that there was improper delegation of legislative power, and that the requirements not only what beyond any sustainable measure of protection of interstate commerce but were also inconsistent with due process. These (meaning the Schechter and Carter) cases are not controlling here.' The later decisions of this Court involving the power of Congress to deal with labor relations in local production do not refer to the Carter Case. At least until this Court definitely overrules that decision, it should be followed.\n Upon the authority of that case, I would reverse the order of the Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that, as applied here, the act is unconstitutional.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","130":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHER v. UNITED STATES(1938)\nNo. 49\nArgued: November 9, 1938Decided: December 5, 1938\n\n\n\n Messrs. Gerald A. Doyle and A. L. Greenspun, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for petitioner. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 251, 252]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Alexander Holtzoff, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner Scher was found guilty under two counts of an indictment which charged violations of section 201, Title 2, Liquor Taxing Act, January 11, 19341 by possessing \n\n[305 \nU.S. 251, 253]\n\u00a0\n and transporting distilled spirits in containers wanting requisite revenue stamps. He was sentenced for a year and a day, etc. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment.\n No objection to the judge's charge is urged and the evidence submitted to the jury is adequate to support the verdict.\n The material facts are not in serious dispute. A brief summation will suffice for the points to be considered.\n Federal officers received confidential information thought to be reliable that about midnight, December 30, 1935, a Dodge automobile with specified license plate would transport 'phony' whiskey from a specified dwelling in Cleveland, Ohio. About nine-thirty officers posted nearby saw the described automobile stop in front of the house and remain there for an hour. A man with three women and a package then entered the car and drove away. It returned shortly before midnight, stopped at the rear of the house and remained for half an hour. The headlights were extinguished; the officers heard what seemed to be heavy paper packages passing over wood. Doors slammed; petitioner drove the car away, apparently heavily loaded. The officers followed in another car. After going a few blocks petitioner stopped briefly at a filling station; then he drove towards his own residence two or three blocks further along. The officers followed. He turned into a garage a few feet back of his residence and within the curtilage. One of the pursuing officers left their car and followed. As petitioner was getting out of his car this officer approached, announced his official character, and stated he was informed that the car was hauling bootleg liquor. Petitioner replied, 'just a little for a party.' Asked whether the liquor was tax paid, he replied that it was Canadian whiskey; also, he said it was in the trunk at the rear of the car. The officer opened the trunk and found eighty-eight bottles of distilled spirits in unstamped containers. He \n\n[305 \nU.S. 251, 254]\n\u00a0\n arrested petitioner and seized both car and liquor. The officer had no search warrant.\n At the trial counsel undertook to question the arresting officers relative to the source of the information which led them to observe petitioner's actions. Objections to these questions were sustained and this is now assigned as error.\n Before trial petitioner's counsel moved 'to suppress all of the evidence obtained by the search made by the Revenue agents in the above entitled cause, together with all information obtained by reason of such search, and to grant an order requiring the agents to return all articles seized by reason of said search ....' In support of this he relied upon the facts above stated. Denial of this motion is said to be error.\n The exception in respect of transporting liquor not intended for sale found in the statute affords matter for affirmative defense. Queen v. United States, 64 App.D.C. 301, 77 F.2d 780.\n In the circumstances the source of the information which caused him to be observed was unimportant to petitioner's defense. The legality of the officers' action does not depend upon the credibility of something told but upon what they saw and heard-what took place in their presence. Justification is not sought because of honest belief based upon credible information as in United States v. Blich, D.C., 45 F.2d 627.\n Moreover, as often pointed out, public policy forbids disclosure of an informer's identity unless essential to the defense as for example where this turns upon an officer's good faith. Segurola v. United States, 1 Cir., 16 F.2d 563, 565; Shore v. United States, 60 App.D.C. 137, 49 F.2d 519, 522; McInes v. United States, 9 Cir., 62 F.2d 180.\n Considering the doctrine of Carroll et al. v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132\n, 45 S.Ct. 280, 39 A.L.R. 790 (see Husty v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 694\n, 51 S.Ct. 240, 74 A.L.R. 1407), \n\n[305 \nU.S. 251, 255]\n\u00a0\n and the application of this to the facts there disclosed, it seems plain enough that just before he entered the garage the following officers properly could have stopped petitioner's car, made search and put him under arrest. So much was not seriously controverted at the argument.\n Passage of the car into the open garage closely followed by the observing officer did not destroy this right. No search was made of the garage. Examination of the automobile accompanied an arrest, without objection and upon admission of probable guilt. The officers did nothing either unreasonable or oppressive. Agnello v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 20, 30\n, 46 S.Ct. 4, 5, 51 A.L.R. 409; Wisniewski v.

Sutherland, both of St. Louis, Mo., for plaintiffs.\n Messrs. A. C. Denison and F. O. Richey, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The principal question for decision is whether the court below rightly sustained the validity of two patents by including in the combination constituting the alleged invention of each an element which was not in terms described in one, and the description of which in the other was added only by amendment to the application after it was filed.\n Respondent, the Cleveland Trust Company, is the assignee in trust of some eighty patents relating to pistons of the type employed in internal combustion engines for automobiles, under a pooling agreement to which an automobile manufacturer and a number of manufacturers of pistons are parties. It brought the present suits in the District Court for Northern Ohio to enjoin infringement of five of the assigned patents. The case was tried before a special master who, upon the basis of elaborate findings, held that the Gulick patent, No. 1,815,733, applied for November 30, 1917, and allowed July 31, 1931, was invalid for want of invention and because of the addition to the application by amendment in 1922 of a new element of the alleged invention. In reaching this conclusion he relied on this Court's decisions in Powers-Kennedy Contracting Corporation v. Concrete Mixing & Conveying Co., 282 \n\n[305 \nU.S. 47, 50]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 175, 51 S.Ct. 95, and Permutit Co. v. Graver Corporation, \n284 \nU.S. 52\n, 52 S.Ct. 53, as inconsistent with the result of interference proceedings in which Gulick's amendments were sustained, Long v. Gulick, 57 App.D.C. 98, 17 F.2d 686; Hartog v. Long, Cust. & Pat.App., 47 F.2d 369. The master also held that the Maynard patent No. 1,655,968, applied for January 3, 1921, and allowed January 10, 1928, was invalid for want of invention and for failure to describe and claim the alleged invention. He held invalid upon various grounds the other patents, which are not presently involved.\n The District Court adopted the findings and conclusions of the master and gave its decree for petitioners. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, as to the Gulick and Maynard patents only, holding that they were valid and infringed. 92 F.2d 330.1 As the court regarded the claims which it sustained as basic and thought that a full recovery could be had by respondent under them, it did not pass upon the validity of the other patents or decide other questions involved in the appeal.\n Petition for certiorari raising the question, among others, whether the Circuit Court of Appeals had erred in holding patentable a combination including one element not described in the original application for the Gulick patent and later added to it by amendment, and not described at all in the Maynard patent, was at first denied, there being no conflict of decision. \n303 \nU.S. 639\n, 58 S.Ct. 609. We later granted certiorari, \n304 \nU.S. 587\n, 58 S.Ct. 1052, on a petition for rehearing showing that, notwithstanding the doubtful validity of the patents, litigation elsewhere with a resulting conflict of decision was improbable because of the concentration of the automobile industry in the Sixth Circuit. Cf. Paramount Publix Corporation v. American Tri-Ergon Corporation, \n294 \nU.S. 464\n, 55 S.Ct. 449; Altoona Publix Theatres, Inc., v. American Tri-Ergon Corporation, \n294 \nU.S. 477\n, 55 S.Ct. 455\n\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 47, 51]\n\u00a0\n It is important for the proper functioning of the piston in a gas engine that it should fit the explosion chamber closely so as to conserve power, prevent the passage of lubricating oil around the piston into the chamber, and insure the smooth and noiseless movement of the piston within the cylinder. In designing gas engines for automobiles and other purposes requiring a high speed piston reciprocation with the accompanying development of high temperature in the explosion chamber, it is desirable to avoid thermal expansion of the close fitting piston, which will result in loss of power and possible injury to the mechanism through increased friction, which may cause the piston to seize or stick. The danger of undue expansion is increased when, as is advantageous in automobile engines, the piston is of aluminum, which has a higher coefficient of expansion than the iron or steel chamber within which the piston moves.\n Both the Gulick and Maynard patents are for combinations in the structure of a piston for gas engines designed to prevent or restrict undue expansion of the piston when in operation. The Gulick patent exhibits a piston in which the ring-carrying head is separated by an air space at its periphery from the cylindrically shaped skirt or guide wall, whose surface engages the inner surface of the cylinder. The piston head and skirt are connected by two 'webs' or walls extending longitudinally through the interior of the skirt. The webs are pierced at right angles for wrist pin bearings and support, at the bearings, piston pin bosses formed with integral flanges extending laterally from their respective bosses to form the webs, which in turn are integrally connected on either side with the interior wall of the lower part of the skirt and at their ends with the piston head. The skirt is longitudinally split on one side at a point in its circumference approximately midway between the pin bosses, with the edges of the skirt formed by the split separated so as \n\n[305 \nU.S. 47, 52]\n\u00a0\n to admit of the free movement of the edges toward each other.\n The structure is thus designed to minimize the expansion resulting from high temperatures developed in the chamber and to avoid the effects of thermal expansion of the skirt. The webs, which afford at the wrist pin bearings the means for connecting the piston rod with the piston, serve to hold the head and skirt in proper relation to each other so that the air space between them retards flow of heat from the head to the skirt, undue expansion of the skirt, and the consequent increase of friction between piston and enveloping cylinder. Undue expansion of the piston is said by the patent's specifications to be avoided by the separation of the skirt by the longitudinal split in order to admit of unrestrained movement of the edges of the skirt toward each other. Elsewhere they state that 'when the longitudinal split is used, as shown, the web structure has sufficient lateral flexibility to permit the split to close more or less under the action of the expansion forces incident to the heating of the piston.'\n The elements of the combination as enumerated in Claim 39 are: 'A piston, open at one end, for an engine cylinder comprising a skirt and head separated from the skirt wall around its entire periphery, said skirt being longitudinally split to render the skirt wall yieldable on every diameter in response to cylinder wall pressure, wrist pin bosses, and means rigidly connecting said bosses to the head and yieldingly connecting said bosses to the skirt whereby said skirt is yieldable in response to cylinder wall pressure.' Reference to a combination including, with other elements, web connections, 'whereby said piston skirt, is rendered yieldable during operation in response to cylinder wall pressure,' appears in Claim 18.\n The combination of piston head separated from a slitted skirt by an air space, the two being connected by \n\n[305 \nU.S. 47, 53]\n\u00a0\n webs supporting wrist pin bearings with bosses which do not come directly in contact with the walls of the skirt, was plainly foreshadowed by the prior art as a practicable means of minimizing the flow of heat from head to skirt and of securing lateral flexibility in the skirt. The expired Spillman and Mooers patent No. 1,092,870, of April 14, 1914, pooled with the patents in suit, showed a piston with head separated by an air space from the skirt, the two being connected by a web separated from the skirt except at the point of integral connection with it at the lower end of the cylinder, and providing bearings for a wrist pin connection with bosses not in direct contact with the wall of the skirt.\n Flexibility of the skirt attained by longitudinal slits was old, as shown by the Ebbs patent No. 700,309 of 1902, and Van Bever, No. 1,031,212 of 1912. The Franquist piston, patent No. 1,153,902 of 1915, another of the pooled patents, which showed piston head partially separated from skirt by air spaces, attained flexibility of the piston wall by longitudinal grooves in the skirt which interrupted its outer periphery though connected at the inner edges of the groove by a fold of the metal on the accordion principle. The Long piston, patent No. 1,872,772 of 1932, which the master and the District Court found was in commercial use from 1917 on, and before the amendment of the Gulick application, presently to be discussed, showed longitudinal slits cut through the skirt, which was separated by air spaces from the piston head, the two being connected by parallel webs pierced for wrist pin bearings.\n The court below found invention in the Gulick disclosure in a combination of elements, of which one was webs 'laterally flexible', which were not specifically so described in the Gulick application until the amendment of 1922. Conceding that the deceleration of the flow of heat from head to skirt by an air gap might be an obvious \n\n[305 \nU.S. 47, 54]\n\u00a0\n expedient of the art, and that to slit the skirt vertically so as to compensate for thermal expansion might not be beyond the skill of the art, the court added: 'But to combine insulation of head from skirt, retraction of the bosses from the skirt periphery, connection of such bosses to the skirt with webs laterally flexible and yet so carried from the head as to support the load upon the wrist pin with sufficient strength and rigidity, and to utilize the mechanical force of the cylinder wall upon the skirt and the thermal expansion of the bosses so as to compensate evenly and fully for head expansion and to secure a balanced flexibility of the skirt with no bending concentration at any point therein, discloses, we think, a meritorious concept beyond the reach of those skilled in the art.' 92 F.2d at page 334.\n We can find no support in the opinion for the contention of respondent that the Circuit Court of Appeals did not consider the flexible web an essential element in Gulick's invention. Its enumeration, among other named elements, of the connection of head and skirt by webs laterally flexible as embodying a meritorious concept must be taken to indicate that the court regarded the flexible webs as a part of the invention, the more so since it indicates that lateral flexibility of the webs is the only feature mentioned not within the prior art or within the expected skill of the art. It rejected, on the authority of Long v. Gulick, supra, and Hartog v. Long, supra, the contention made below and pressed here that Gulick's application as filed did not disclose 'webs laterally flexible' and the resultant 'balanced flexibility of the skirt,' and that those features were added to specifications and claims after the use of the Long piston and after they had appeared in Hartog.\n The Gulick application, which was filed November 30, 1917, contained no reference in terms to laterally flexible webs or to the function of the webs in securing flexibility \n\n[305 \nU.S. 47, 55]\n\u00a0\n of the skirt. The specifications pointed to no inadequacy in the structure or function of webs of the prior art which would be remedied by the webs specified and to no function to be performed by them other than as a means of connecting and holding head and skirt so as to maintain the air gap between them and to support the wrist pin bearings and their bosses as both were shown in Spillman and Mooers. On the contrary, Gulick's application described the webs as 'extremely rigid' and stated that an object of the invention was 'to rigidly support the piston pin bosses of a piston from the piston walls.' The only description of the web structure was as follows: 'It will be seen that in addition to providing a piston with a split skirt the above described construction also provides an extremely rigid connection between the piston pin bosses and the skirt of the piston, which construction may be used either with or without the split skirt and separated head. The arrangement of the supporting flanges 17 between the ends of the piston pin bosses and the connection of those flanges with the piston skirt provide a particularly strong support for the bosses.'\n The webs as shown by the drawings conform to the specifications of an 'extremely rigid connection' between piston pin bosses and skirt and 'a particularly strong support for the bosses.' They form chords subtending the are of the circle of the skirt, with flanges depending from the head to the bosses at right angles to the webs, and the skirt as shown is provided with interior corrugations and with an inturned flange at the bottom, all familiar devices for securing rigidity of structure. Neither drawings nor specifications give dimensions showing thickness or other proportions which might suggest a flexible structure.\n In 1922, after the Long piston, whose webs concededly were laterally flexible, was in commercial use, and Hartog, to the knowledge of Gulick's assignee, had specified and \n\n[305 \nU.S. 47, 56]\n\u00a0\n claimed a yieldable web, Gulick copied the Hartog claim and amended his specifications so as to state that one of the objects of his invention was 'to rigidly support the piston pin bosses of a piston from the piston wall against mechanical load thrust from the connecting rod without interfering with the yielding characteristics of the skirt in response to cylinder wall pressure.' And he amended his description of the web structure to read: 'The arrangement of the supporting flanges 17 between the ends of the piston pin bosses and the connections of those flanges with both the piston guide portion and the head provide a particularly strong construction, and at the same time, when the longitudinal split is used, as shown, the web structure has sufficient lateral flexibility to permit the split to close more or less under the action of the expansion forces incident to the heating of the piston.'\n Petitioners insist that the flexible web element of the Gulick combination, as found and sustained by the court below, is excluded from the Gulick patent by reason of his failure to describe that element in his application as filed and that he could not cure the omission and secure a patent embodying that feature by substituting by way of amendment 'webs laterally flexible' for 'extremely rigid webs' in the description of his invention. The statute, R.S.  4888, 35 U.S.C.A.  33, provides that the application which the inventor must file as a prerequisite to a patent shall contain 'a written description of (his invention) ... and of the manner and process of making, constructing ... and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art ... to ... construct ... and use the same; and in case of a machine, he shall explain the principle thereof, and the best mode in which he has contemplated applying that principle, so as to distinguish it from other inventions ....' \n\n[305 \nU.S. 47, 57]\n\u00a0\n The object of the statute is to require the patentee to describe his invention so that others may construct and use it after the expiration of the patent and 'to inform the public during the life of the patent of the limits of the monopoly asserted, so that it may be known which features may be safely used or manufactured without a license and which may not.' Permutit Co. v. Graver Corporation, \n284 \nU.S. 52, 60\n, 52 S.Ct. 53, 55. It follows that the patent monopoly does not extend beyond the invention described and explained as the statute requires, Permutit Co. v. Graver Corporation, supra, at page 57, 52 S.Ct. at page 54; that it cannot be enlarged by claims in the patent not supported by the description, Snow v. Lake Shore & M.S. Ry. Co., \n121 \nU.S. 617\n, 7 S.Ct. 1343; cf. Smith v. Snow, \n294 \nU.S. 1\n, 55 S.Ct. 279; and that the application for a patent cannot be broadened by amendment so as to embrace an invention not described in the application as filed, at least when adverse rights of the public have intervened.

Gutmann Co., \n304 \nU.S. 159\n, 58 S.Ct. 842.\n Respondent earnestly argues, as both courts held in the itnerference proceedings, Long v. Gulick, supra, and Hartog v. Long, supra, that the changes in Gulick's application were not alterations in the description of his invention but were at most a permissible clarification of its description of the flexible web element which was present, or at least plainly suggested, in the specifications and drawings of the Gulick application. Flexibility, it is said, as is well known to those skilled in the art, is an inherent property of the metal out of which the webs are made, and in consequence reference to the webs in the application as filed was sufficient to import into it as a part of the description of the invention their known quality of \n\n[305 \nU.S. 47, 58]\n\u00a0\n flexibility, a description which was made more specific, but not altered, by the amendments. The argument suggests that it was but the skill of the art, and not invention, to substitute a flexible for a rigid means of connecting head and skirt in a known combination of piston head separated from a slitted skirt by an air space and connected by webs. But in any case we think it falls short of establishing that the Gulick amendments were not new matter beyond the scope of the device described in the application as filed.\n The properties of any given material are many and diverse. The antithetical qualities of rigidity and flexibility of a structure are not absolute but relative; it may be more rigid than some and more flexible than others; too rigid for some purposes and too flexible for others. The one quality may be increased and the other diminished by choice of materials from which the structure is made and by variation in its proportions. If invention depends on emphasis of one quality over the other, as the court below found was the case with the laterally flexible webs in the Gulick devise, the statute requires that emphasis to be revealed to the members of the public, who are entitled to know what invention is claimed. That is not accomplished either by naming a member having inherent antithetical properties or by ascribing to it one property when the other is meant. Since rigidity is a relative term, the characterization of the structure as rigid must be taken as emphasizing rigidity rather than its opposite, flexibility, with special reference to the conditions to be encountered in the operation of the piston. Even if those skilled in the art would have known that a piston with webs which would yield enough laterally to accommodate the constriction of the split skirt under the pressure developed by thermal expansion would work most effectively if the webs were laterally flexible rather than \n\n[305 \nU.S. 47, 59]\n\u00a0\n rigid, that was not the invention which Gulick described by his references to an extremely rigid web.\n Gulick also failed to explain the principle of his machine so as to distinguish it from the prior art. Webs having the inherent properties both of rigidity and flexibility were familiar elements in piston structure. The court below, after pointing out that the slots of the Franquist skirt rendered it capable of limited construction, found a distinguishing feature of Gulick's piston to be a web relatively flexible laterally, so as to accommodate the constriction of skirt to thermal expansion, the combination operating to secure a 'balanced flexibility' of the skirt. But that principle-facilitating skirt constriction rather than obstructing it-was first explained and its embodiment in the flexible- webbed device was first claimed by the amendments to the application.\n As already indicated, the omission from the specifications was not supplied by the drawings, which failed to disclose by dimensions the proportions of the webs. Inherent flexibility of the web in cooperation with the slit skirt cannot be depended upon to produce the desired effect in rendering the skirt yieldable in response to cylinder wall pressure. As respondent's own expert testified, that depends upon design of the web, with correct proportioning of the different parts as to location and thickness to produce lateral flexibility. Inherent rigidity, made more effective by design of the webs, would correspondingly curtail the desired effect.\n We recognize the weight to be attached to the determinations in the interference proceedings in which the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals sustained the Gulick amendments. Cf. Radio Corporation v. Radio Engineering Laboratories, \n293 \nU.S. 1, 7\n, 55 S.Ct. 928. But the decisions in those cases are not controlling here. So far as the courts relied on \n\n[305 \nU.S. 47, 60]\n\u00a0\n the inherent flexibility of the webs to supply the feature of lateral flexibility omitted from the Gulick description they ignored the principle recognized in Permutit Co. v. Graver Corporation, supra, and Powers- Kennedy Contracting Corporation v. Concrete Mixing & Conveying Co., supra. So far as they relied on the drawings to supply the omission they disregarded the fact shown both by inspection and by the evidence presented here that the drawings do no more to point to Gulick's invention than does the fact of inherent flexibility. We conclude that respondent can take no benefit from the flexible web element added by amendment to the Gulick application.\n In sustaining the claims of the Maynard patent the court below said that 'Maynard ... embodies the Gulick combination of skirt insulation, skirt flexibility by means of vertical slotting cooperating with longitudinal slotting, and flexible webs in the region of the writs pin bosses. He also follows Jardine's simplified design to permit economical manufacture and Jardine's boss relief', and after enumerating certain mechanical features of the Maynard construction differing from Gulick and Jardine, concluded: 'It is clear that Maynard, while not departing from the teaching of Gulick in basic combination of elements, discloses a piston lighter and more economical of manufacture than Gulick and one more rugged and durable than Jardine.' 92 F.2d at page 337.\n Invention over Gulick and Jardine was apparently found in the details of construction but, as we are without other indication of the character of the invention, we construe the court's opinion as including the laterally flexible webs as an essential element in the patented combination. As flexible webs are neither described in Maynard's specifications nor mentioned in his claims, they can be imported into them only by reference to the drawings or by inference from the inherent flexibility of the structure, which, for reasons already given in our considera- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 47, 61]\n\u00a0\n tion of the Gulick amendments, are insufficient to accomplish that result. We conclude that the court below erred in giving any effect to so much of the Gulick patent as by amendment describes or claims the flexible webs, and in treating any of the specifications or claims in Gulick and Maynard as referring to such webs. We assume that it sustained Claim 1 of the Gulick patent, which makes no mention of web flexibility, only by reading into it that element, which the court regarded as an essential part of the invention.\n As the Circuit Court of Appeals did not pass upon other questions in the case, the causes will be reversed and remanded to it for further proceedings, in conformity with this opinion, with respect to such claims of the patents in suit as appellant below submitted to that court for adjudication.\n On the remand the Court of Appeals will be free to consider whether the amendments to the Gulick application rendered void the patent issued upon it, and to consider all questions affecting the validity and infringement of the claims in suit of the Gulick and Maynard patents, but without including web flexibility or laterally flexible webs as an element in the combinations patented by them.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n It is further ordered that respondent's motion to modify the judgments and the opinion be in all other respects denied, and that the petition for rehearing be denied. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The decree sustained Gulick's claims numbered 1, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 30 and 33, and Maynard's claims numbered 1, 6 and 8. \n\n\n\n\n","132":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHULTZ v.

COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA(1938)\nNo. 447\nArgued: December 6, 1937Decided: January 3, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 506, 507]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John Robert Jones, of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellant.\n Mr. Manuel Kraus, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 506, 508]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In Schuylkill Trust Company v. Pennsylvania, \n296 \nU.S. 113\n, 56 S.Ct. 31, we held an act of Pennsylvania1 invalid as construed and applied in the calculation of the amount of the tax thereby imposed. The statute requires every trust company chartered under the general corporation law to report annually to the Department of Revenue the number of outstanding shares and their actual value at the close of the preceding calendar year. The department is to assess the shares for taxation at five mills upon the dollar. The taxable value of each share is to be ascertained by adding together so much of the amount of paid-in capital stock, surplus, and undivided profits as is not invested in shares of corporations liable to pay or exempted from payment of the Pennsylvania capital stock tax, or relieved from the payment of a tax on shares, and dividing this amount by the number of shares. The company must pay the tax from its general fund within 60 days after assessment, or collect it from the shareholders and pay it over. Provision is made for posting notice of the assessment in the company's office so that shareholders shall be advised of the amount of the assessment and for a hearing of any shareholder who objects to the valuation of the shares. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Securities owned by a trust company may have been purchased out of deposits or from the capital, surplus, and undivided profits. Since securities, the value of which is by the act deductible from the tax base, may have been purchased out of either of the two funds, it is open to the company to prove that they or any of them were \n\n[302 \nU.S. 506, 509]\n\u00a0\n purchased out of capital, surplus, or undivided profits. Upon such a showing these securities are fully exempt from tax. Where the company has not made this showing the practice in assessing the tax has been to grant a so-called proportionate deduction in respect of such exempt securities. \n3\n This is accomplished by the use of the following formula: A fraction, the numerator of which is the capital, surplus, and undivided profits at book value, less the book value of those investments, if any, for which a full deduction has been made, and the denominator, the book value of the permanent investments, less the book value of those investments, if any, for which a full deduction has been made, is applied to the book value of the securities which are to be apportioned, after adjustment for appreciation or depreciation of those securities, and the resulting sum is deducted from the capital, surplus, and undivided profits. In this manner a portion of the value of each exempted security reflected in the capital, surplus, and profits is deducted before the value per share is determined by dividing the capital surplus and profits so diminished by the number of shares outstanding.\n Upon the former appeal it was shown that whereas a proportionate deduction was allowed for shares of Pennsylvania corporations previously taxed, or shares of such corporations exempt from tax, no deduction was accorded in respect of shares of a national bank and bonds of the federal government and its instrumentalities owned by the company. The appellant's position was that the act, though it purported to tax the shares, in fact taxed the net assets of the company which included shares of stock of a national bank and securities of the federal government and its instrumentalities owned by the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 506, 510]\n\u00a0\n appellant. An alternative claim was that, if the levy was upon the shares as such, the application of the act worked a discrimination against national bank shares and other federal securities by excluding from the base a proportionate part of the value of shares of certain Pennsylvania corporations while leaving in the base national bank shares and federal securities; and that, if the tax was upon the shares, it was bad as the Commonwealth was without power to tax the shares of nonresident stockholders. The Commonwealth insisted the tax was upon the shares and not upon assets, that the application of the statute involved no discrimination against federal securities and that the State had jurisdiction to tax the shares of nonresident shareholders.\n We found it unnecessary to determine whether the tax was upon shares or assets. Amongst the assets were shares of national bank stock which had been taxed to the company as owner, pursuant to R.S.  5219, as amended. \n4\n These we held must be excluded from the base upon which the tax was calculated. We held further that the exclusion from the base of a proportion of the value of tax-exempt shares of Pennsylvania corporations, and the refusal of like treatment of federal securities, operated as an unconstitutional discrimination against the latter. We reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and remanded the cause for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion.\n After our mandate went down the Commonwealth moved the trial court to redetermine the tax by disregarding the amendatory statute involved in our decision and reverting to the basic act of June 13, 1907,5 which was claimed not to be affected by the infirmity of the amendatory act. The appellant insisted that as we had set aside \n\n[302 \nU.S. 506, 511]\n\u00a0\n the judgment and held the amendatory act of April 25, 1929,6 invalid as construed and applied, the only action open to the trial court was the entry of a judgment for the appellant. The court refused to follow either of the suggested courses, holding that the Legislature, by the act of 1929, intended to exercise only such power as it lawfully possessed and did not attempt to impose a tax upon securities exempted by federal law. It found that the purpose of the statute could be accomplished by eliminating the national bank shares from the tax base and by treating the other federal securities in the same manner as tax-exempt stock of state corporations. It accordingly recalculated the tax. The appellant took the case to the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth which affirmed the judgment. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n By appropriate exceptions and assignments of error the appellant challenges the new judgment upon these grounds: That the courts below have disregarded the mandate of this court and have exceeded their powers in reassessing the tax; that the tax is one upon assets and not upon shares, and federal securities are left in the tax base as to at least a portion of their value; that, if the tax is upon the shares rather than upon the assets, there is still a discrimination against federal securities because the stockholders of appellant and other similar corporations are wholly exempted from any tax calculated upon the value of the shares of national banks whereas at least a portion of the value of other federal securities still remains in the tax base; and that, in any event, the impost is bad so far as it is laid upon the shares of nonresident shareholders. The Commonwealth argues that the tax is upon the shares as such and not upon assets; that in assessing it no discrimination is practiced \n\n[302 \nU.S. 506, 512]\n\u00a0\n against federal securities and in favor of the exempted stock of Pennsylvania corporations; and that, if the tax is otherwise valid, the fact that it is laid upon all shareholders, including nonresidents, does not void it as respects the latter.\n First. When the case was previously heard we held the statute invalid as construed and applied and remanded the cause for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion. It is clear that the State courts were not precluded from construing the statute so as to eliminate the unconstitutional features. It follows that the appellant was not entitled, as a matter of right, to a general judgment in its favor exempting it from all tax.\n Second. The contention that the State courts really have not construed the act but have themselves amended it, and that this is judicial legislation forbidden by the Constitution of Pennsylvania, is not open here. As the trial court pointed out, courts, in applying a statute, general and sweeping in its terms, may construe it as not intended to reach subjects which, by reason of constitutional prohibition, the Legislature is without power to touch. Whether the courts of the Commonwealth exceeded their powers under the State Constitution is not a federal question. We accept their construction of the act.\n Third. As the case is now presented, we find it necessary to determine whether the tax is upon the shares as such or upon the capital, surplus, and profits of the company. The statute on its face lays the tax upon the property of the stockholder, represented by the shares he owns. The State courts, and the local federal court, have held the imposition a tax upon the shares. \n8\n The history of legisla- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 506, 513]\n\u00a0\n tion respecting taxation of banks and trust companies in Pennsylvania leads to the same conclusion. \n9\n We are of opinion that the tax is one upon the shares as such and not upon the assets of the company.\n Fourth. The State need not have made any exemption or concession in taxing the property in the shares on account of value therein reflected from the company's ownership of obligations of the government or its instrumentalities \n\n[302 \nU.S. 506, 514]\n\u00a0\n other than national bank stock. \n10\n And the discrimination found upon the earlier appeal in failing to accord proportionate exemption to federal securities similar to that extended to exempt shares of domestic corporations has been removed, for all are now accorded like treatment by way of deduction.\n Fifth. The fact that the shareholders of a trust company whose investments consist of national bank stock would pay no tax, because R.S.  5219, 12 U.S.C.A.  548, permits but a single tax thereon which has been paid by the company as owner, whereas those holding shares in a trust company which owns only other federal securities would not be entitled to a similar total exemption but only to a proportionate deduction unless it could be shown that those securities were purchased from capital, surplus, and undivided profits, does not evidence an illegal discrimination against such securities. The inability of a State to measure a tax by certain assets exempted by federal law does not preclude it from reckoning in the tax base all those it can reach. And the principle of equal protection does not demand that because one company owns wholly exempt securities, with consequent exemption of its shareholders from the exaction, the State shall abstain from taxing the shareholders of another company whose investments carry no such exemption.\n Sixth. The State courts have held that nonresident as well as resident shareholders are within the scope of the statute, and we are bound by this construction. The appellant argues that as thus applied the statute would take their property without due process and deny them equal protection in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, since the taxing \n\n[302 \nU.S. 506, 515]\n\u00a0\n power of Pennsylvania is limited to persons and property within her jurisdiction. The contention was overruled by the State Supreme Court, and we think rightly so, upon the authority of Corry v. Baltimore, \n196 \nU.S. 466\n, 25 S.Ct. 297. There this court held that under a similar statute Maryland and its municipal subdivisions could impose a levy for revenue upon nonresident shareholders measured by the value of their shares in a domestic corporation. The distinctions between that case and this, to which the appellant points, are not significant. In reliance upon Tappan v. Merchants' National Bank, 19 Wall. 490, wherein we held it competent for the United States to provide by a statute which became part of the charter of every national bank that the shares shall be taxable to the shareholders by the State wherein the bank is located, the court proceeded, in the Corry Case, to the proposition that, where a State statute made similar provision for the taxation of the shares of nonresident stockholders at the home of a domestic corporation, the legislation did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. \n11\n There the corporation was made liable for the payment of the tax and given a right of reimbursement over against the shareholders. Here the appellant has the option either to pay the tax from its general fund or to collect it from the shareholder and pay it over to the State. The distinctions thought by the appellant to require a different ruling in this case are that, in the Corry Case, the act declaring the liability of the shares of nonresidents antedated the charter of the corporation and provided that the situs of shares owned by nonresidents should, for the purposes of taxation, be at the domicile of the corporation in the State of Mary- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 506, 516]\n\u00a0\n land, whereas, in the instant case, the statute imposing the tax on shares, which has been held to include the shares of nonresidents, was adopted 20 years after the appellant's incorporation and says nothing about the situs of the shares. We think these differences are unimportant in respect of the principle involved. The State Constitution for many years prior to the granting of the charter contained the reserved right to alter, amend, and repeal corporate charters, and every stockholder acquired his shares with full knowledge that his interest in the corporation was subject to regulation and taxation. Moreover, the shares represent a property interest, an aliquot proportion of the whole corporate assets. The shareholders, whether domestic or foreign, depend for the preservation and protection of this property upon the law of the State of the corporation's domicile. The property right so represented is of value, arises where the corporation has its home, and is therefore within the taxing jurisdiction of that state;12 and this, notwithstanding the ownership of the stock may also be a taxable subject in another state. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of June 13, 1907, P.L. 640, as amended by the acts of July 11, 1923, P.L. 1071, May 7, 1927, P.L. 853, and April 25, 1929, P.L. 673, 72 P.

Pa.  1935-1937, 1971; Act of May 1, 1868, P.L. 108,  10, 72 P.S. Pa.  1912. It also taxed the shares of state banks. Act of December 22, 1869, P.L. (1870) 1373; Act of June 10, 1881, P.L. 99; Act of June 30, 1885, P.L. 193; Act of June 8, 1891, P.L. 229 (the last- named act was sustained in Commonwealth v. Merchants & Manufacturers National Bank, 168 Pa. 309, 31 A. 1065, affirmed \n167 \nU.S. 461\n, 17 S.Ct. 829); Act of July 15, 1897, P.L. 292, amended by Act of May 2, 1925, P.L. 497, and Act of April 25, 1929, P.L. 677, 72 P.S.

Some of the earlier of these acts provided for the taxation of the shares of trust companies upon the same basis as shares of banks were taxed, but by the Act of June 1, 1889, P.L. 420, trust companies were made liable for a so-called capital stock tax which is in fact a tax upon assets and no tax was levied upon the shares in such companies. The Act of 1907, supra, note 1, was passed in order to conform taxation applicable to trust companies with that then current with respect to banks. As states in Commonwealth v. Mortgage Trust Company, 227 Pa. 163, 175, 76 A. 5, 8: 'The policy of the commonwealth for more than 20 years was to tax the capital stock of these companies in the same manner as other corporations created under the general corporation act of 1874 were taxed. ... This method of taxing the capital stock of these institutions continued in force until the act of 1907 was passed. As the trust company business grew in magnitude ... the question of the proper method of taxing the capital stock of these corporations frequently arose. It was contended in their behalf that banks were their natural competitors, that their business partook of the nature of banking, and that they should be taxed in like manner. As a result of this feeling, and the agitation which followed it, the act of 1907 was passed. It is apparent that the Legislature intended to tax trust companies on the same basis as banks.' \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573; First National Bank v.

John C. Lawyer and R. Stanley Anderson, both of Chicago, Ill., for appellants.\n Mr. Leo F.

On August 9, 1934, the National Mediation Board requested the Commission to determine whether that carrier fell within the exemption from the scope of the Railway Labor Act, as amended June 21, 1934, 48 Stat. 1185, c. 691,  1, 45 U.S.C.  151, 45 U.S.C.A.  151. That act confers upon the National Mediation Board certain duties in respect to carriers by railroad subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, with the following exception: 'Provided, however, that the term 'carrier' shall not include any street, interurban, or suburban electric rail- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 596, 598]\n\u00a0\n way, unless such railway is operating as a part of a general steam- railroad system of transportation, but shall not exclude any part of the general steam-railroad system of transportation now or hereafter operated by any other motive power. The Interstate Commerce Commission is hereby authorized and directed upon request of the Mediation Board, or upon complaint of any party interested to determine after hearing whether any line operated by electric power falls within the terms of this proviso.'\n After due hearing had, at which the South Shore introduced evidence and filed its brief, the matter was argued orally before the Commission, which, on February 14, 1936, made its report and the following determination (Chicago South Shore & South Bend Railroad, 214 I.C.C. 167, 173): 'We find that the line of the Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad is not a street, interurban, or suburban electric railway within the meaning of the exemption proviso in the first paragraph of section 1 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended June 21, 1934, and it is therefore subject to the provisions of that act.'\n No order was entered thereon by the Commission.\n Shannahan and Jackson, who had been appointed trustees of the South Shore by the federal court of Northern Indiana, and had filed their appearance in the proceeding, applied for a rehearing. An order was entered denying the same. Thereupon, the trustees filed this suit against the United States, invoking the jurisdiction of the court under the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, to set aside the alleged order. They do not deny that the South Shore is an interstate carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission; and that the act is constitutional. Their contention is that: 'A correct application of the law to the undisputed facts leads to the conclusion that the lines of the railroad of appellants are an electric interurban railway under the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 596, 599]\n\u00a0\n exemption proviso of the first division of Section 1 of the Railway Labor Act and that there is no substantial evidence to support the conclusion and determination of the Commission.'\n The Commission intervened. Its answer, and that of the United States, challenged the jurisdiction of the court on the ground that the determination of the Commission was not an 'order' within the meaning of the Urgent Deficiencies Act. The case was heard before three judges on the pleadings and evidence; and a decree was entered dismissing the bill for want of jurisdiction, one judge dissenting. D.C., 20 F.Supp. 1002. The Trustees appealed.\n First. The function of the Commission is limited to the determination of a fact. Its decision is not even in form an order. It 'had no characteristic of an order, affirmative or negative.' United States v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 82, 89\n, 37 S.Ct. 584, 587; United States v. Atlanta, B. & C.R. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 522, 527\n, 528 S., 51 S.Ct. 237, 238, 239. Compare Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 412, 414\n, 37 S.Ct. 397. But even if this difficulty is overlooked, others are insuperable. The decision neither commands nor directs anything to be done. 'It was merely preparation for possible action in some proceeding which may be instituted in the future.' United States v. Los Angeles & S.L.R. Co., \n273 \nU.S. 299, 310\n, 47 S.Ct. 413, 414. The determination is thus not enforceable by the Commission; the only action which could ever be taken on it would by by some other body. It is as clearly 'negative' as orders by which the Commission refuses to take requested action. United States v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 226\n, 58 S.Ct. 601.2 As such, it is not reviewable under the Urgent Deficiencies Act. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 596, 600]\n\u00a0\n Second. Moreover, the determination of the Commission is not even a decision which the Mediation Board, by whom it was sought, is empowered to enforce. The act confers upon the Board no power over any carrier. It merely imposes upon the Board possible duties in respect to interstate carriers by railroad not exempted by the proviso. The Board's duties, in case of dispute between carrier and employees, require it:\n\n\n (1)\n To 'promptly put itself in communication with the parties to (the) controversy, and ... use its best efforts, by mediation, to bring them to agreement.' Section 5, subd. 1, as amended, 45 U.S.C.A.  155, subd. 1. When a dispute is settled through these efforts a mediation agreement is signed, and should any question arise subsequently regarding the meaning or application of such an agreement, the Board is required upon request of either party 'and after a hearing of both sides (to) give its interpretation within thirty days.' Section 5, subd. 2, as amended, 45 U.S. C.A.  155, subd. 2.\n\n\n (2)\n If the mediating efforts prove unsuccessful, it is the Board's duty to 'at once endeavor as its final required action ... to induce the parties to submit their controversy to arbitration, in accordance with the provisions of' the act. Section 5, subd. 1, as amended, 45 U.S.C.A.  155, subd. 1. If arbitration is agreed upon it may become the Board's duty to name a third arbitrator if the two named by the parties fail to select him.\n\n\n (3)\n If arbitration is refused and the dispute threatens 'substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive any section of the country of essential transportation service,' then the Board is required to notify the President. Section 10, as amended, 45 U.S.C.A.  160.\n\n\n (4)\n If, in selecting representatives to deal with the carriers, disputes arise among employees as to what organization they desire to represent them, it is the duty of the Board, on request of either party, to investigate \n\n[303 \nU.S. 596, 601]\n\u00a0\n and to certify in writing to the parties and to the carrier the names of the individuals or organizations that have been designated and authorized to represent the employees.\n\n\n (5)\n If the National Railroad Adjustment Board undertakes arbitration, and it fails to select a referee, the Mediation Board has the duty of doing so.\n In order not to fail in the performance of these duties the Mediation Board had to satisfy itself whether the South Shore was a railroad within the exemption proviso. To that end, it applied to the Commission for its determination. If it had omitted to do so, the application might have been made 'upon complaint of any party interested.' The determination, whether applied for by the Board, by a carrier, or by employees, is clearly not an order enforceable within the meaning of the cases construing and applying the Urgent Deficiencies Act. It is a decision on a controverted matter, comparable to that considered in United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R.R. Co., \n273 \nU.S. 299\n, 47 S.Ct. 413, in Great Northern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 172\n, 48 S.Ct. 466, in United States v. Atlanta B. & C. Ry. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 522\n, 51 S.Ct. 237, and in United States v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 226\n, 58 S.Ct. 601, which were held not to be subject to review under the Urgent Deficiencies Act.\n Third. The trustees argue that the determination of the Commission is an affirmative 'order, because it fixed for the first time, by the only body authorized by law to do so, the status of the carrier'; that by fixing the status, the obligations of the Railway Labor Act are fixed upon the carrier; and that willful failure or refusal of any carrier to comply with certain of the obligations is made a misdemeanor. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 596, 602]\n\u00a0\n Lehigh Valley R.R. Co. v. United States, supra, shows that the determination of a status or similar matter is not action subject to review under the Urgent Deficiencies Act even if disregard of the determination may subject the carrier to criminal prosecution. \n4\n The Panama Canal Act, 37 Stat. 560, 566,  11, as amended, 49 U.S.C.A.  5(10-12), prohibited, after July 1, 1914, any ownership by a railroad in any common carrier by water where the railroad might compete with the water carrier; prescribed a heavy penalty for any violation of the prohibition; and conferred upon the Commission jurisdiction: 'to determine questions of fact as to the competition or possibility of competition, after full hearing, on the application of any railroad company or other carrier. Such application may be filed for the purpose of determining whether any existing service is in violation ... of this section and pray for an order permitting the continuance of any vessel or vessels already in operation.'\n Thereupon in January, 1914, the Lehigh Valley filed with the Commission a petition for a hearing on the question whether the services of a steamboat line owned by it would be in violation of the above section and for an extension of time. The Commission held that, by vir- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 596, 603]\n\u00a0\n tue of the arrangements found to exist, the railroad did or might compete with its boat line; and dismissed the petition. This Court held that the risk to which the railroad was left subject did not come from the order, but from the statute which contained the prohibition and provided a penalty; that, therefore, it was not an affirmative order; and that the District Court was without jurisdiction under the Urgent Deficiencies Act. Compare also Piedmont & No. R. Co. v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 469, 476\n, 477 S., 50 S.Ct. 192, 193.\n Fourth. Whether the determination of the Commission is reviewable in a district court by some judicial procedure other than that of the Urgent Deficiencies Act we have no occasion to consider. Compare United States v. Griffin, supra, and Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. United States, supra. \n5\n\u00a0\n\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219, 220, 28 U.S.C.  41(28), 46, 47, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(28), 46, 47. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See, also, Procter & Gamble Co. v.

Quirk, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 177, 179]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the questions of the effect of a determination by the Interstate Commerce Commission, for the purposes of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., that the respondent is not an interurban electric railway, and of the scope of judicial review of that determination.\n The Railway Labor Act, which applies to railroads engaged in interstate commerce, excepts any 'interurban' electric railway unless it is operating as a part of a general steam-railroad system of transportation. \n1\n The Interstate Commerce Commission is 'authorized and directed upon request of the Mediation Board or upon complaint of any party interested to determine after hearing whether any line operated by electric power' falls within the exception. At the request of the Mediation Board, the Interstate Commerce Commission after hearing determined that the lines of respondent, the Utah Idaho Central Railroad Company, do not constitute an interurban electric railway. 214 I.C.C. 707. The Mediation Board ordered respondent to post the formal notice prescribed by Section 2, Eighth, of the Railway Labor Act. \n2\n Respondent did not comply. Failure to publish the notice subjects 'the carrier, officer, or agent offending' to criminal penalties. \n3\n Respondent, insisting that its line is an interurban electric railway and thus excepted from the Railway Labor Act, and alleging the invalidity of the Act, brought this suit against the United States Attorney for the District of \n\n[305 \nU.S. 177, 180]\n\u00a0\n Utah to restrain him from prosecuting any proceeding based upon an alleged violation of the Act.\n The District Court took jurisdiction, permitted respondent to try the question de novo, decided that respondent was an interurban electric railway, and granted a permanent injunction. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 10 Cir., 95 F.2d 911. We granted certiorari. \n304 \nU.S. 556\n, 58 S. Ct. 1055. May 31, 1938\n\n\n As respondent, however characterized, is engaged in interstate transportation, the question whether it should be subjected to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, relating to the adjustment of labor disputes, was one for the decision of Congress. These requirements were prescribed in the exercise by Congress of its constitutional control over interstate commerce. Texas & New Orleans R.R. Co. v. Railway Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548\n, 50 S.Ct. 427; Virginian Railway Co. v. System Federation No. 40, \n300 \nU.S. 515\n, 57 S.Ct. 592. As Congress was free to establish the categories which should be excepted, Congress could bring to its aid an administrative agency to determine the question of fact whether a particular railroad fell within the exception, and Congress could make that factual determination, after hearing and upon evidence, conclusive. St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 38, 51\n, 56 S.Ct. 720, 725. For that purpose Congress could create a new administrative agency or use one already existing. And as the questions of fact involved would relate to methods of railroad transportation, and thus to a field in which the Interstate Commerce Commission had peculiar expertness, Congress could fittingly commit the determination to that body.\n Congress did not define the term 'interurban'. Despite the desirability of such a definition4 and the diffi- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 177, 181]\n\u00a0\n culties occasioned by its absence, the term is not so destitute of meaning that it can be denied effect as a valid description. Respondent, standing upon the exception, necessarily treats it as valid and hence as susceptible of application. That view presupposes that the term 'interurban' denotes distinguishing factual characteristics which on appropriate inquiry may be ascertained. We have so treated the term in other relations. Piedmont & Northern Rwy. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 299\n, 52 S.Ct. 541; United States v. Chicago North Shore & Milwaukee R.R. Co., \n288 \nU.S. 1\n, 53 S.Ct. 245. The conferring of authority upon the Interstate Commerce Commission to determine whether a particular electric railway is an interurban one cannot be regarded as an unconstitutional delegation of power. See United States v. Chicago North Shore & Milwaukee R.R. Co., supra, at pages 13, 14, 53 S.Ct. at pages 248, 249.\n In the instant case, the Interstate Commerce Commission has made the determination contemplated by the statute and we are not concerned with the questions which might arise in its absence. The Commission's determination was one of fact. Shannahan v. United States, \n303 \nU.S. 596, 599\n, 58 S.Ct. 732, 733, 734. What effect shall be ascribed to it? The argument is pressed that the determination is at best persuasive and not in any wise binding upon the courts. It is urged that the Commission was restricted to determining whether respondent was operated as a part of a general steam-railroad system of transportation, which concededly it was not; that the determination of the Commission was not an 'order'; that Congress has not manifested an intention that the determination should be binding in judicial proceedings and that in the nature of things it could not be made binding in criminal prosecutions.\n We are unable to agree with the view expressed in the court below that the Commission was confined to determining whether respondent was operated as a part of a \n\n[305 \nU.S. 177, 182]\n\u00a0\n general steam-railroad system of transportation. Before reaching that point-as to which there was no question-the Commission had to determine whether respondent was an 'interurban' line. That has been the administrative construction of the statutory provision5 and we see no reason to doubt its correctness.\n In considering the effect of the Commission's determination, the fundamental question is the intent of Congress. The language of the provision points to definitive action. The Commission is to 'determine'. The Commission must determine 'after hearing'. The requirement of a 'hearing' has obvious reference 'to the tradition of judicial proceedings in which evidence is received and weighed by the trier of the facts'. The 'hearing' is 'the hearing of evidence and argument'. Morgan v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 468, 480\n, 56 S.Ct. 906, 911. And the manifest purpose in requiring a hearing is to comply with the requirements of due process upon which the parties affected by the determination of an administrative body are entitled to insist. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 33 S.Ct. 185, 186. The Commission is not only authorized but 'directed' to give the hearing and make the determination when requested. We cannot think that a determination so prescribed and safeguarded was intended to have no legal effect. On the contrary, in view of the nature and purpose of the proceeding, we must regard the determination as binding on both the carrier and the Mediation Board. The latter having obtained the determination could not ignore it; neither could the carrier.\n We have held that the determination of the Commission is not an 'order' reviewable under the Urgent De- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 177, 183]\n\u00a0\n ficiencies Act of October 22, 1913.6 Shannahan v. United States, supra. But we have not held that the determination of the Commission was not subject to judicial review by other procedure, a question which, as we said in the Shannahan Case, we had no occasion there to consider. Id., at page 603, 58 S.Ct. 735. The nature of the determination points to the propriety of judicial review. For, while the determination is made by the Interstate Commerce Commission for the purposes of the Railway Labor Act and not for further proceedings by the Commission itself, it is none the less a part of a regulatory scheme. It has the effect, if validly made, of subjecting the respondent to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act which was enacted to regulate the activities of transportation companies engaged in interstate commerce. \n7\n The Mediation Board has ordered the posting of the prescribed notice that disputes between the carrier and its employees will be handled under the Railway Labor Act. Disobedience is immediately punishable and it is made the duty of the United States Attorney to institute proceedings against violators. Respondent has invoked the equity jurisdiction to restrain such prosecution and the Government does not challenge the propriety of that procedure. Equity jurisdiction may be invoked when it is essential to the protection of the rights asserted, even though the complainant seeks to enjoin the bringing of criminal actions. Philadelphia Company v. Stimson, \n223 \nU.S. 605, 621\n, 622 S., 32 S.Ct. 340, 345. Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33, 37\n, 38 S., 36 S.Ct. 7, 8, 9, L.R.A.1916D, 545, Ann.Cas.1917B, 283. Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 214\n, 44 S.Ct. 15, 17. To support its contention that equitable relief is appropriate, respondent points to the peculiar difficulties which confront it \n\n[305 \nU.S. 177, 184]\n\u00a0\n under the congressional legislation. Congress has enacted two sets of statutes which involve the application of the same criterion. If respondent is subject to the Railway Labor Act, it is excluded from the application of the National Labor Relations Act;8 otherwise not. The Railroad Retirement Act of 19379 has a like proviso excepting interurban electric railways and authorizing the Interstate Commerce Commission to determine whether a particular electric railway falls within the exception. A similar provision is found in the Carriers Taxing Act of 193710 and in the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act of 1938.11 In these circumstances we think respondent was entitled to resort to equity in order to obtain a judicial review of the questions of the validity and effect of the Commission's determination purporting to fix its status.\n What is the scope of the judicial review to which respondent is entitled? As Congress had constitutional authority to enact the requirements of the Railway Labor Act looking to the settlement of industrial disputes between carriers engaged in interstate commerce and their employees,12 and could include or except interurban carriers as it saw fit, no constitutional question is presented calling for the application of our decisions13 with respect \n\n[305 \nU.S. 177, 185]\n\u00a0\n to a trial de novo so far as the character of the respondent is concerned. With respect to that question, unlike the case presented in United States v. Idaho, \n298 \nU.S. 105\n, 56 S.Ct. 690, where the Interstate Commerce Commission was denied the authority to determine the character of the trackage in question (Id., page 107, 56 S.Ct. page 691), the Commission in this instance was expressly directed to make the determination. As this authority was validly conferred upon the Commission, 14 the question on judicial review would be simply whether the Commission had acted within its authority. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R.R. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 32 S.Ct. 108, 110; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 33 S.Ct. 185, 186; Virginian Railway Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 663\n, 47 S.Ct. 222, 224; Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420, 444\n, 50 S.Ct. 220, 226; Florida v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 54 S.Ct. 603, 608; 78 L.Ed. 1077; St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, supra.\n The condition which Congress imposed was that the Commission should make its determination after hearing. There is no question that the Commission did give a hearing. Respondent appeared and the evidence which it offered was received and considered. The sole remaining question would be whether the Commission in arriving at its determination departed from the applicable rules of law and whether its finding had a basis in substantial evidence or was arbitrary and capricious. Id. That question must be determined upon the evidence produced before the Commission.\n Taking that position, petitioners unsuccessfully objected in the District Court to the admission of new evidence. But that evidence was substantially the same \n\n[305 \nU.S. 177, 186]\n\u00a0\n as that produced before the Commission, which was also received. The facts carefully analyzed by the Commission (214 I.C.C. pages 709-711) are virtually undisputed. Respondent's railway extends from Ogden, Utah, north to Preston, Idaho, a distance of 94.63 miles and has two branch lines of about 7 and 14 miles respectively. About 81.8 per cent. of the line is located on privately owned right-of-way and the remaining 18.2 per cent. on public streets or highways, these being chiefly in fifteen cities and towns. The Government concedes the point stressed by respondent that its line has many of the physical characteristics of an interurban railroad. Thus its tracks on the whole are of lighter weight, its grades slightly steeper, its curves sharper, its stations and sidetracks more frequent, its motive power of less capacity, its sidetracks shorter than is customary on trunk lines, and its passenger business is conducted in the same manner as that of any interurban electric railway. The passenger business, however, yields but a minor part (about 18.1 per cent.) of the total revenues. During the five years from 1930 to 1934, inclusive, the freight revenues amounted to $2,021,724.57 and the revenues from passengers, mail and express were $448,941.62. The railway is predominantly a carrier of freight. The freight traffic consists to a large extent of raw products such as sugar beets, milk, tomatoes and peas moving to factories, canneries or processing plants, and of the manufactured products moving outbound from the plants to connecting railroads. A considerable part of the movement of the raw products requires special service with one-car or two-car trains. A daily package- merchandise train is maintained with facilities for refrigeration in summer and heating in winter and with pick-up and delivery service at all available points. In 1934 the freight trains averaged 6.2 cars each. In the last half of that year the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 177, 187]\n\u00a0\n carrier handled 6,354 carloads of freight of which 2,226 were local and 4, 017 were interchanged with other carriers. The traffic originating on its line moved to points in 31 States and that delivered by it was from points in 26 States. Respondent is a party to practically all the tariffs publishing through rates to or from this territory and its interchange traffic generally moves on joint rates. It does not perform intermediate service between other lines. Practically all the interchange traffic is handled in standard equipment furnished by connecting railroads.\n It cannot be said upon this evidence, and the related facts summarized in the Commission's report, that the Commission's determination lacked support or was arbitrary or capricious. Nor is there ground for holding that the Commission in reaching its determination departed from applicable principles of law. There is no principle of law which required such a carrier to be classified as an interurban railway. Failing in its effort to obtain a clarifying definition from Congress, the Commission performed its duty in weighing the evidence and reaching its conclusion in the light of the dominant characteristics of respondent's operations which were fairly comparable to those of standard steam railroads.

Barnwell Bros. Inc. \n303 \nU.S. 177\n (1938) ]\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 180]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Steve C. Griffith, of Newberry, S.C., Thomas W. Davis, of Wilmington, N.C., and Eugene S. Blease, of Newberry, S.C., for appellants.\n Messrs. S. King Funkhouser, and Frank Coleman, both of Roanoke, Va., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Act No. 259 of the General Assembly of South Carolina, of April 28, 1933, 38 St. at Large, p. 340, prohibits use on the state highways of motor trucks and 'semi-trailer motor trucks' whose width exceeds 90 inches, and whose weight including load exceeds 20,000 pounds. For purposes of the weight limitation, section 2 of the statute provides that a semitrailer motortruck, which is a motor propelled truck with a trailer whose front end is designed to be attached to and supported by the truck, shall be considered a single unit. The principal question for decision is whether these prohibitions impose an unconstitutional burden upon interstate commerce. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 181]\n\u00a0\n Appellees include the original plaintiffs below, who are truckers and interstate shippers; the Interstate Commerce Commission; and certain others who were permitted to intervene as parties plaintiff. The suit was brought in the District Court for Eastern South Carolina against various state officials, to enjoin them from enforcing sections 4 and 6 of the act among others,1 on the ground that they have been superseded by the Federal Motor Carrier Act of 1935, c. 498, 49 Stat. 546, 49 U.S.C.A.  304; that they infringe the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and that they impose an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. Certain railroads interested in restricting the competition of interstate motor carriers were permitted to intervene as parties defendant.\n The District Court of three judges, after hearing evidence, ruled that the challenged provisions of the statute have not been superseded by the Federal Motor Carrier Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  301-327, and adopted as its own the ruling of the state Supreme Court in State ex rel. Daniel v. John P. Nutt Co., 180 S.C. 19, 185 S.E. 25, that the challenged provisions, being an exercise of the state's power to regulate the use of its highways so as to protect them from injury and to insure their safe and economical use, do not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. But it held that the weight and width prohibitions place an unlawful burden on interstate motor traffic passing over specified highways of the state, which for the most part are of concrete or a concrete base surfaced with asphalt. In accordingly enjoined the enforcement of the weight provision against interstate motor carriers on the specified highway, and also \n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 182]\n\u00a0\n the width limitation of 90 inches, except in the case of vehicles exceeding 96 inches in width. It exempted from the operation of the decree, bridges on those highways 'not constructed with sufficient strength to support the heavy trucks of modern traffic or too narrow to accommodate such traffic safely,' provided the state highway department should place at each end of the bridge proper notices warning that the use of the bridge is forbidden by trucks exceeding the weight or width limits and provided the proper authorities take the necessary steps to enforce the law against such use of the bridges. The case comes here on appeal under section 266 of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U.S.C.A.  380.\n The trial court rested its decision that the statute unreasonably burdens interstate commerce, upon findings, not assailed here, that there is a large amount of motortruck traffic passing interstate in the southeastern part of the United States, which would normally pass over the highways of South Carolina, but which will be barred from the state by the challenged restrictions if enforced, and upon its conclusion that, when viewed in the light of their effect upon interstate commerce, these restrictions are unreasonable.\n To reach this conclusion the court weighed conflicting evidence and made its own determinations as to the weight and width of motortrucks commonly used in interstate traffic and the capacity of the specified highways of the state to accommodate such traffic without injury to them or danger to their users. It found that interstate carriage by motortrucks has become a national industry; that from 85 to 90 per cent of the motor trucks used in interstate transportation are 96 inches wide and of a gross weight, when loaded, of more than 10 tons; that only four other states prescribe a gross load weight as low as 20,000 pounds; and that the American Association of State Highway Officials and the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety in the Department of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 183]\n\u00a0\n Commerce have recommended for adoption weight and width limitations in which weight is limited to axle loads of 16,000 to 18,000 pounds and width is limited to 96 inches.\n It found in detail that compliance with the weight and width limitations demanded by the South Carolina act would seriously impede motortruck traffic passing to and through the state and increase its cost; that 2,417 miles of state highways, including most of those affected by the injunction, are of the standard construction of concrete or concrete base with asphalt surface, 7 1\/2 or 8 inches thick at the edges and 6 or 6 1\/2 inches thick at the center; that they are capable of sustaining without injury a wheel load of 8,000 to 9,000 pounds or an axle load of double those amounts, depending on whether the wheels are equipped with high-pressure or low-pressure pneumatic tires; that all but 100 miles of the specified highways are from 18 to 20 feet in width; that they constitute a connected system of highways which have been improved with the aid of federal money grants, as a part of a national system of highways; and that they constitute one of the best highway systems in the southeastern part of the United States.\n It also found that the gross weight of vehicles is not a factor to be considered in the preservation of concrete highways, but that the appropriate factor to be considered is wheel or axle weight; that vehicles engaged in interstate commerce are so designed and the pressure of their weight is so distributed by their wheels and axles that gross loads of more than 20,000 pounds can be carried over concrete roads without damage to the surface; that a gross weight limitation of that amount, especially as applied to semitrailer motortrucks, is unreasonable as a means of preserving the highways; that it has no reasonable relation to safety of the public using the highways; and that the width limitation of 90 inches is un- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 184]\n\u00a0\n reasonable when applied to standard concrete highways of the state, in view of the fact that all other states permit a width of 96 inches, which is the standard width of trucks engaged in interstate commerce.\n In reaching these conclusions, and at the same time holding that the weight and width limitations do not infringe the Fourteenth Amendment, the court proceeded upon the assumption that the commerce clause, Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3, imposes upon state regulations to secure the safe and economical use of highways a standard of reasonableness which is more exacting when applied to the interstate traffic than that required by the Fourteenth Amendment as to all traffic; that a standard of weight and width of motor vehicles which is an appropriate state regulation when applied to intrastate traffic may be prohibited because of its effect on interstate commerce, although the conditions attending the two classes of traffic with respect to safety and protection of the highways are the same.\n South Carolina has built its highways and owns and maintains them. It has received from the federal government, in aid of its highway improvements, money grants which have been expended upon the highways to which the injunction applies. But appellees do not challenge here the ruling of the District Court that Congress has not undertaken to regulate the weight and size of motor vehicles in interstate motor traffic and has left undisturbed whatever authority in that regard the states have retained under the Constitution.\n While the constitutional grant to Congress of power to regulate interstate commerce has been held to operate of its own force to curtail state power in some measure,2 \n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 185]\n\u00a0\n it did not forestall all state action affecting interstate commerce. Ever since Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245, and Cooley v. Board of Port Wardens, 12 How. 299, it has been recognized that there are matters of local concern, the regulation of which unavoidably involves some regulation of interstate commerce but which, because of their local character and their number and diversity, may never be fully dealt with by Congress. Notwithstanding the commerce clause, such regulation in the absence of congressional action has for the most part been left to the states by the decisions of this Court, subject to the other applicable constitutional restraints.\n The commerce clause by its own force, prohibits discrimination against interstate commerce, whatever its form or method, and the decisions of this Court have recognized that there is scope for its like operation when state legislation nominally of local concern is in point of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 186]\n\u00a0\n fact aimed at interstate commerce, or by its necessary operation is a means of gaining a local benefit by throwing the attendant burdens on those without the state. Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District, \n120 \nU.S. 489, 498\n, 7 S.Ct. 592; Caldwell v. North Carolina, \n187 \nU.S. 622, 626\n, 23 S.Ct. 229.3 It was to end these practices that the commerce clause was adopted. See Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 187; Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 438, 439; Cooley v. Board of Port Wardens, supra; State Freight Tax Case, 15 Wall. 232, 280; State Tax on Railway Gross Receipts, 15 Wall. 284, 289, 297, 298; Cook v.

The commerce clause has also been thought to set its own limitation upon state control of interstate rail carriers so as to preclude the subordination of the efficiency and convenience of interstate traffic to local service requirements. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 187]\n\u00a0\n But the present case affords no occasion for saying that the bare possession of power by Congress to regulate the interstate traffic forces the states to conform to standards which Congress might, but has not adopted, or curtails their power to take measures to insure the safety and conservation of their highways which may be applied to like traffic moving intrastate. Few subjects of state regulation are so peculiarly of local concern as is the use of state highways. There are few, local regulation of which is so inseparable from a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Unlike the railroads, local highways are built, owned, and maintained by the state or its municipal subdivisions. The state has a primary and immediate concern in their safe and economical administration. The present regulations, or any others of like purpose, if they are to accomplish their end, must be applied alike to interstate and intrastate traffic both moving in large volume over the highways. The fact that they affect alike shippers in interstate and intrastate commerce in large number within as well as without the state is a safeguard against their abuse.\n From the beginning it has been recognized that a state can, if it sees fit, build and maintain its own highways, canals, and railroads, and that in the absence of congressional action their regulation is peculiarly within its competence, even though interstate commerce is materially affected. Minnesota Rate Cases; Simpson v. Shepard, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 416\n, 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A., N.S., 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18. Congress not acting, state regulation of intrastate carriers has been upheld regardless of its effect upon interstate commerce. Id. With respect to the extent and nature of the local interests to be protected and the unavoidable effect upon interstate and intrastate commerce alike, regulations of the use of the highways are akin to \n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 188]\n\u00a0\n local regulation of rivers, harbors, piers, and docks, quarantine regulations, and game laws, which, Congress not acting, have been sustained even though they materially interfere with interstate commerce. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 189]\n\u00a0\n The nature of the authority of the state over its own highways has often been pointed out by this Court. It may not, under the guise of regulation, discriminate against interstate commerce. But, 'In the absence of national legislation especially covering the subject of interstate commerce, the state may rightly prescribe uniform regulations adapted to promote safety upon its highways and the conservation of their use, applicable alike to vehicles moving in interstate commerce and those of its own citizens.' Morris v. Duby, \n274 \nU.S. 135, 143\n, 47 S.Ct. 548, 550. This formulation has been repeatedly affirmed, Clark v. Poor, \n274 \nU.S. 554, 557\n, 47 S.Ct. 702, 703; Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163, 169\n, 48 S.Ct. 502, 504, 62 A.L.R. 45; Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 389\n, 390 S., 52 S.Ct. 581, 585; cf. Morf v. Bingaman, \n298 \nU.S. 407\n, 56 S.Ct. 756, and never disapproved. This Court has often sustained the exercise of that power, although it has burdened or impeded interstate commerce. It has upheld weight limitations lower than those presently imposed, applied alike to motor traffic moving interstate and intrastate. Morris v. Duby, supra; Sproles v. Binford, supra. Restrictions favoring passenger traffic over the carriage of interstate merchandise by truck have been similarly sustained, Sproles v. Binford, supra; Bradley v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, \n289 \nU.S. 92\n, 53 S.Ct. 577, 85 A.L.R. 1131, as has the exaction of a reasonable fee for the use of the highways, Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610\n, 35 S.Ct. 140; Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160\n, 37 S.Ct. 30; Interstate Busses Corp. v. Blodgett, \n276 \nU.S. 245\n, 48 S.Ct. 230; Morf v. Bingaman, supra; cf. Ingels v. Morf, \n300 \nU.S. 290\n, 57 S.Ct. 439.\n In each of these cases regulation involves a burden on interstate commerce. But so long as the state action does not discriminate, the burden is one which the Constitution permits because it is an inseparable incident of the exercise of a legislative authority, which, under the Constitution, has been left to the states.\n Congress, in the exercise of its plenary power to regulate interstate commerce, may determine whether the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 190]\n\u00a0\n burdens imposed on it by state regulation, otherwise permissible, are too great, and may, by legislation designed to secure uniformity or in other respects to protect the national interest in the commerce, curtail to some extent the state's regulatory power. But that is a legislative, not a judicial, function, to be performed in the light of the congressional judgment of what is appropriate regulation of interstate commerce, and the extent to which, in that field, state power and local interests should be required to yield to the national authority and interest. In the absence of such legislation the judicial function, under the commerce clause, Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3, as well as the Fourteenth Amendment, stops with the inquiry whether the state Legislature in adopting regulations such as the present has acted within its province, and whether the means of regulation chosen are reasonably adapted to the end sought. Sproles v. Binford, supra; Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251, 272\n, 53 S.Ct. 181, 187, 87 A.L.R. 721.\n Here the first inquiry has already been resolved by our decisions that a state may impose nondiscriminatory restrictions with respect to the character of motor vehicles moving in interstate commerce as a safety measure and as a means of securing the economical use of its highways. In resolving the second, courts do not sit as Legislatures, either state or national. They cannot act as Congress does when, after weighing all the conflicting interests, state and national, it determines when and how much the state regulatory power shall yield to the larger interests of a national commerce. And in reviewing a state highway regulation where Congress has not acted, a court is not called upon, as are state Legislatures, to determine what, in its judgment, is the most suitable restriction to be applied of those that are possible, or to choose that one which in its opinion is best adapted to all the diverse interests affected. Parkersburg & O. River Transp. Co. v. Parkersburg, \n107 \nU.S. 61, 695\n, 2 S.Ct. 732. When the action of a Legislature is \n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 191]\n\u00a0\n within the scope of its power, fairly debatable questions as to its reasonableness, wisdom, and propriety are not for the determination of courts, but for the legislative body, on which rests the duty and responsibility of decision. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 \nU.S. 11, 30\n, 25 S.Ct. 358, 3 Ann.Cas. 765; Laurel Hill Cemetery v. San Francisco, \n216 \nU.S. 358, 365\n, 30 S.Ct. 301; Price v. Illinois, \n238 \nU.S. 446, 451\n, 35 S.Ct. 892; Hadacheck v. Sebastian, \n239 \nU.S. 394\n, 408-414, 36 S.Ct. 143, Ann.Cas. 1917B, 927; Thos. Cusack Co. v. Chicago, \n242 \nU.S. 526, 530\n, 37 S.Ct. 190, L.R.A.1918A, 136, Ann.Cas.1917C, 594; Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., \n272 \nU.S. 365, 388\n, 47 S.Ct. 114, 118, 54 A.L.R. 1016; Zahn v.

This is equally the case when the legislative power is one which may legitimately place an incidental burden on interstate commerce. It is not any the less a legislative power committed to the states because it affects interstate commerce, and courts are not any the more entitled, because interstate commerce is affected, to substitute their own for the legislative judgment. Morris v. Duby, supra, \n274 \nU.S. 135, 143\n, 47 S.Ct. 548, 549; Sproles v. Binford, supra, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 389\n, 390 S., 52 S.Ct. 581, 585; Minnesota Rate Cases, supra, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 399\n, 400 S., 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.,N.S., 1151, Ann.Cas.1916A, 18; Smith v. St. Louis & S.W.R. Co., \n181 \nU.S. 248, 257\n, 21 S.Ct. 603; Reid v. Colorado, \n187 \nU.S. 137, 152\n, 23 S. Ct. 92; New York ex rel. Silz v. Hesterberg, \n211 \nU.S. 31, 42\n, 43 S., 29 S.Ct. 10.\n Since the adoption of one weight or width regulation, rather than another, is a legislative, not a judicial, choice, its constitutionality is not to be determined by weighing in the judicial scales the merits of the legislative choice and rejecting it if the weight of evidence presented in court appears to favor a different standard. Cf. Worcester County Trust Co. v. Riley, \n302 \nU.S. 292\n, 58 S.Ct. 185. Being a legislative judgment it is presumed to be supported by facts known to the Legislature unless facts judicially known or proved preclude that possibility. Hence, in reviewing the present determination, we examine the record, not to see whether the findings of the court below are supported by evidence, but to ascertain upon the whole \n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 192]\n\u00a0\n record whether it is possible to say that the legislative choice is without rational basis. Standard Oil Co. v. Marysville, supra; Borden's Farm Products Co. v. Ten Eyck, \n297 \nU.S. 251, 263\n, 56 S.Ct. 453, 456; Id., D.C., 11 F.Supp. 599, 600. Not only does the record fail to exclude that possibility but it shows affirmatively that there is adequate support for the legislative judgment.\n At the outset it should be noted that underlying much of the controversy is the relative merit of a gross weight limitation as against an axle or wheel weight limitation. While there is evidence that weight stresses on concrete roads are determined by wheel rather than gross load weights, other elements enter into choice of the type of weight limitation. There is testimony to show that the axle or wheel weight limitation is the more easily enforced through resort to weighing devices adapted to ascertaining readily the axle or wheel weight. But it appears that in practice the weight of truck loads is not evenly distributed over axles and wheels; that commonly the larger part of the load-sometimes as much as 70 to 80 per cent.-rests on the rear axle, and that it is much easier for those who load trucks to make certain that they have complied with a gross load weight limitation than with an axle or wheel weight limitation. While the report of the National Conference on State and Highway Safety, on which the court below relied, suggested a wheel weight limitation of 8,000 or 9,000 pounds, it also suggested that a gross weight limitation might be adopted and should be subject to the recommended wheel limitation. But the Conference declined to fix the amount of gross weight limitation, saying: 'In view of the varying conditions of traffic, and lack of uniformity in highway construction in the several States, no uniform gross-weight limitations are here recommended for general adoption throughout the country.' The choice of a weight limitation based on convenience of application and consequent lack of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 193]\n\u00a0\n need for rigid supervisory enforcement is for the Legislature, and we cannot say that its preference for the one over the other is in any sense arbitrary or unreasonable. The choice is not to be condemned because the Legislature prefers a workable standard, less likely to be violated than another under which the violations will probably be increased but more easily detected. It is for the Legislature to say whether the one test or the other will in practical operation better protect the highways from the risk of excessive loads.\n If gross load weight is adopted as the test, it is obvious that the permissible load must be somewhat lighter than if the axle or wheel weight test were applied. With the latter the gross weight of a loaded motortruck can never exceed twice the axle and four times the wheel limit. But the fact that the rear axle may and often does support as much as 70 or 80 per cent. of the gross load, with wheel weight in like proportion, requires that a gross load limit be fixed at considerably less than four times the permissible wheel limit.\n There was testimony before the court to support its conclusion that the highways in question are capable of sustaining without injury a wheel load of 8,000 or 9,000 pounds, the difference depending upon the character of the tire in use, as against a wheel load of as much as 8,000 pounds, which would be possible under the statutory load limit of 20,000 pounds as applied to motortrucks, and approximates the axle limit in addition to the gross load limit recommended by the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety. Much of this testimony appears to have been based on theoretical strength of concrete highways laid under ideal conditions, and none of it was based on an actual study of the highways of South Carolina or of the subgrade and other road building conditions which prevail there and which have a material bearing on the strength and durability of such highways. There is \n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 194]\n\u00a0\n uncontradicted testimony that approximately 60 per cent. of the South Carolina standard paved highways in question were built without a longitudinal center joint which has since become standard practice, the portion of the concrete surface adjacent to the joint being strengthened by reinforcement or by increasing its thickness; and that owing to the distribution of the stresses on concrete roads when in use, those without a center joint have a tendency to develop irregular longitudinal cracks. As the concrete in the center of such roads is thinner than that at the edges, the result is that the highway is split into two irregular segments, each with a weak inner edge which, according to the expert testimony, is not capable of supporting indefinitely wheel loads in excess of 4,200 pounds.\n There is little in the record to mark any controlling distinction between the application of the gross load weight limitation to the motortruck and to the semitrailer motortruck. There is testimony which is applicable to both types of vehicle, that in case of accident the danger from the momentum of a colliding vehicle increases with gross load weight. The record is without convincing evidence of the actual distribution, in practice, of the gross load weight over the wheels and axles of the permissible types of simitrailer motortrucks, but this does not enable us to say that the Legislature was without substantial ground for concluding that the relative advantages of a gross load over a wheel weight limitation are substantially the same for the two types, or that it could not have concluded that they were so nearly alike for regulatory purposes as to justify the adoption of a single standard for both, as a matter of practical convenience. Even if the Legislature were to accept appellees' assumption that net load weights are, in practice, evenly distributed over the wheels supporting the load of a permissible semitrailer so that with the statutory gross \n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 195]\n\u00a0\n load limit the load on the rear axle would be about 8,000 pounds it might, as we have seen, also conclude that the danger point would then have been reached in the case of some 1,200 miles of concrete state roads constructed without a center joint.\n These considerations, with the presumption of constitutionality, afford adequate support for the weight limitation without reference to other items of the testimony tending to support it. Furthermore, South Carolina's own experience is not to be ignored. Before adoption of the limitation South Carolina had had experience with higher weight limits. In 1924 it had adopted a combined gross weight limit of 20,000 pounds for vehicles of four wheels or less, and an axle weight limit of 15,000 pounds. In 1930 it had adopted a combined gross weight limit of 12 1\/2 tons with a five-ton axle weight limit for vehicles having more than two axles. Act March 26, 1924, No. 721, 33 Stat. 1182; Act March 20, 1930, No. 685, 36 St. at Large pp. 1192, 1193. In 1931 it appointed a commission to investigate motor transportation in the state, to recommend legislation, and to report in 1932. The present weight limitation was recommended by the commission after a full consideration of relevant data, including a report by the state engineer who had constructed the concrete highways of the state and who advised a somewhat lower limitation as necessary for their preservation. The fact that many states have adopted a different standard is not persuasive. The conditions under which highways must be built in the several states, their construction, and the demands made upon them, are not uniform. The road building art, as the record shows, is far from having attained a scientific certainty and precision, and scientific precision is not the criterion for the exercise of the constitutional regulatory power of the states. Sproles v. Binford, supra, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 388\n, 52 S.Ct. 581, 585. The Legislature, being free to exercise its own judgment, is not bound by that of other Legislatures. It would hardly be contended \n\n[303 \nU.S. 177, 196]\n\u00a0\n that if all the states had adopted a single standard none, in the light of its own experience and in the exercise of its judgment upon all the complex elements which enter into the problem, could change it.\n Only a word need be said as to the width limitation. While a large part of the highways in question are from 18 to 20 feet in width, approximately 100 miles are only 16 feet wide. On all the use of a 96-inch truck leaves but a narrow margin for passing. On the road 16 feet wide it leaves none. The 90-inch limitation has been in force in South Carolina since 1920, and the concrete highways which it has built appear to be adopted to vehicles of that width. The record shows without contradiction that the use of heavy loaded trucks on the highways tends to force other traffic off the concrete surface onto the shoulders of the road adjoining its edges, and to increase repair costs materially. It appears also that as the width of trucks is increased it obstructs the view of the highway, causing much inconvenience and increased hazard in its use. It plainly cannot be said that the width of trucks used on the highways in South Carolina is unrelated to their safety and cost of maintenance, or that a 90-inch width limitation, adopted to safeguard the highways of the state, is not within the range of the permissible legislative choice.\n The regulatory measures taken by South Carolina are within its legislative power. They do not infringe the Fourteenth Amendment, and the resulting burden on interstate commerce is not forbidden.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Section 4.

Williamson, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for the motion.\n Messrs. Erwin W. Clausen of St. Louis, Mo., and Jacob R. Spielman, of Oklahoma City, Okl., opposed.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Motion to dismiss, for the want of jurisdiction, an appeal from a determination of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, made September 14, 1937, denying a 'petition for rehearing in the nature of judicial review' after a decision affirming an order of the Corporation Commission of the State fixing rates for telephone service. The motion is upon the ground that the proceeding in the state court was legislative and was not a suit within the mean- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 206, 208]\n\u00a0\n ing of section 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  344, 28 U. S.C.A.  344, governing our appellate jurisdiction.\n The Constitution of Oklahoma authorizes the Corporation Commission to prescribe rates 'for transportation and transmission companies.' Article 9 ,  18. Appellant, operating telephone lines, is a 'transmission company.' Article 9,  34. Appeals from the Commission may be taken only to the Supreme Court of the State. Article 9,  20. No court of the State, other than the Supreme Court by way of appeal has jurisdiction 'to review, reverse, correct, or annul' any action of the Commission within the scope of its authority, save that writs of mandamus and prohibition will lie from the Supreme Court to the Commission 'in all cases where such writs, respectively, would lie to any inferior court or officer.' Id. In case of appeal, no new or additional evidence may be introduced in the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to consider and determine 'the reasonableness and justness of the action of the Commission appealed from, as well as any other matter arising under such appeal.' The action of the Commission is to be regarded 'as prima facie just, reasonable, and correct,' but the court may, when it deems necessary in the interests of justice, remand to the Commission any case pending on appeal 'and require the same to be further investigated by the Commission, and reported upon to the court (together with a certificate of such additional evidence as may be tendered before the Commission by any party in interest), before the appeal is finally decided.' Article 9,  22.\n Section 23 of article 9 provides:\n ,'whenever the court, upon appeal, shall reverse an order of the Commission affecting the rates, charges, or the classifications of traffic of any transportation or transmission company, it shall, at the same time, substitute therefor such orders as, in its opinion, the Commission \n\n[303 \nU.S. 206, 209]\n\u00a0\n should have made at the time of entering the order appealed from; otherwise the reversal order shall not be valid. Such substituted order shall have the same force and effect (and none other) as if it had been entered by the Commission at the time the original order appealed from was entered.'\n In the instant case, the Corporation Commission on March 18, 1935, after hearing, made its order fixing appellant's rates (Okla.Corp.Com.Rep., 1935, p. 558), and on appeal the Supreme Court of the State, on July 13, 1937, affirmed the order. 71 P.2d 747.\n Appellant concedes that this decision was legislative in character, in view of the authority conferred by the above-quoted provision of section 23 of article 9 and its construction by the state court. See Pioneer Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. State, 40 Okl. 417, 425, 426, 138 P. 1033; Swain v. Oklahoma Railway Co., 168 Okl. 133, 134, 136, 32 P.2d 51; Oklahoma Cotton Ginners' Association v. State, 174 Okl. 243, 248, 251, 51 P.2d 327. Compare Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 210, 226\n, 227 S., 29 S.Ct. 67; Oklahoma Gas Company v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290, 291\n, 43 S.Ct. 353. But appellant contends that the Supreme Court of the State 'completed its legislative review and function by the filing of its opinion of July 13, 1937,' and that appellant was then free to invoke the jurisdiction of the court to exercise its judicial power and function by an application for 'a judicial review.' This, appellant states, was the purpose of its petition for rehearing.\n In support of that petition, appellant urged upon the Supreme Court of the State the consideration of the provisions of the State Constitution with respect to the vesting of judicial power and the appellate jurisdiction of the court, article 7,  1 and 2; of the bill of rights guaranteeing a judicial remedy for every injury, article 2,  6; of section 22 of article 9 providing that, on appeals to the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 206, 210]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court from the Corporation Commission, that court should have jurisdiction to determine 'the reasonableness and justness' of the action of the Commission 'as well as any other matter' arising on the appeal; and of section 34 of article 9 that the provisions of that article should 'always be so restricted in their application as not to conflict with any of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, and as if the necessary limitations upon their interpretation had been herein expressed in each case.' In concluding the submission of its petition for rehearing appellant insisted that the Supreme Court of the State 'not only has the power, right, jurisdiction and authority, now to review this case judicially, which right, power, jurisdiction and authority it has not heretofore possessed, but that it is the duty to this court to do so at this stage of the proceeding, in order that appellant may have the legislative order or enactment fixing its rates for future application at Tulsa reviewed by an appropriate federal court with the least possible delay and cost, if such should later be found necessary, resulting from an adverse decision by this (the state) court.'\n The ruling of the state court was expressed in the following journal entry:\n'Now on this 14th day of September 1937, the Court having considered appellant's Petition for Rehearing in the Nature of Judicial Review, doth overrule and deny same, to which appellant is allowed exception.'\n\n At appellant's request, the state court granted supersedeas and stayed its mandate pending appellant's application for the allowance of an appeal to this Court and the determination of the appeal if taken. An appeal was then allowed by the Chief Justice of the state court and the case is thus brought here.\n The Attorney General of the State, moving to dismiss the appeal, insists that appellant's contention that the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 206, 211]\n\u00a0\n action of the state court in denying the petition for rehearing 'was a judicial review, is wholly erroneous'; that the appeal is 'from a purely legislative consideration of the questions involved.' The substance of the Attorney General's argument is shown in the following statement:\n'This Petition for Rehearing ... was not sufficient to confer, upon the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, jurisdiction and power to treat the record then before it as a new cause involving a judicial review, and no record was before said court warranting said court to treat same as a judicial appeal, nor was the said record, nor its contents, treated as such by appellant, nor the court, and no judicial issues were raised in said legislative review. It is not the rule to permit the character of controversies to be completely changed, either in form or substance, after the opinion of a court has been handed down, and this is especially true when the same is sought to be accomplished, for the first time by a so- called petition for rehearing in which the only subject mentioned was the request for a judicial review for the first time in the history of the case.'\n\n The Attorney General, however, does not concede that the State of Oklahoma 'does not furnish an adequate judicial review of questions such as are involved in this proposed appeal.' On the contrary, 'the State asserts that appellant has, and has had, an adequate method of relief.' When pressed upon the argument at bar to state what judicial remedy was open to appellant under the State Constitution, the Attorney General referred to the power conferred upon the Supreme Court by the proviso in section 20 of article 9 to issue writs of mandamus and prohibition to the Commission. No decision of the state court as to the questions which would be open upon an application for such a writ has been brought to our attention.\n Appellant states that the question now presented is one of first impression; that the action of the state court \n\n[303 \nU.S. 206, 212]\n\u00a0\n in this case 'constitutes the first construing of this (the present) procedure which that court has ever made. There are no specific precedents.'\n The novelty of the procedure, and the lack of exposition in the brief ruling, leave us in doubt as to the true import of the denial of the petition for rehearing. In view of the serious questions which would be raised if it were determined that the State provides no means of obtaining a judicial review of an order of the Commission fixing rates, alleged to be confiscatory, in the case of a transportation or transmission company, we should not reach such a conclusion in the absence of a definite decision by the state court to that effect. Neither party before us advances a contention that there is such a lack of judicial remedy. Appellant says that judicial review is available through the procedure appellant has chosen and that the denial of its petition for rehearing was judicial action. The Attorney General asserts the contrary, contending that judicial remedy exists but must be sought in another manner. But- assuming that the State affords a judicial remedy-whether the state court has denied appellant's petition because an application for rehearing after what is conceded by both parties to be a legislative determination was not the proper way under the state practice to invoke the judicial power, or has entertained the application and by its ruling has passed upon the controversy in a judicial capacity, we have no means of knowing.\n We have repeatedly held that it is essential to the judisdiction of this Court in reviewing a decision of a court of a State that it must appear affirmatively from the record, not only that a federal question was presented for decision to the highest court of the State having jurisdiction, but that its decision of the federal question was necessary to the determination of the cause; that the federal question was actually decided or that the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 206, 213]\n\u00a0\n judgment as rendered could not have been given without deciding it.

It has no capital stock, and transacts its affairs without profit and solely for the mutual benefit of its members and their beneficiaries. It makes provision for the payment of death benefits by assessments upon its members and issues to members certificates assuring payment of such benefits.\n In 1895 the petitioner adopted a by-law authorizing the issue of life membership certificates. Under this by-law a member entering the order at an age greater than 43 years was entitled to life membership without the payment of further dues and assessments when the certificate had been outstanding 20 years. In June 1896, while the by-law remained unrepealed, Pleasant Bolin, who was over 43 years of age, joined a Missouri lodge of the petitioner and received a certificate of membership which recited that while in good standing he would be entitled to participate in the beneficial fund to the amount of $1,000 payable to his beneficiaries and to the sum of $100 for placing a monument at his grave. The certificate recited that it was issued subject to all the conditions named in the constitution and laws of the fra ternity \n\n[305 \nU.S. 66, 73]\n\u00a0\n and was endorsed with the words 'Payments to cease after 20 years.'\n After Bolin's death, the respondents, as beneficiaries, brought action to recover upon the certificate. The petitioner's answer set up that Bolin had ceased to pay the required dues and assessments in July 1916, and his certificate had therefore become void; that the by-law making the certificate fully paid after twenty years was ultra vires the association and had been so declared by the Supreme Court of Nebraska in a class suit brought by one Trapp, the holder of a certificate similar to that of Bolin; that, under Article 4, Section 1, of the Constitution, U.S. C.A.Const. art, 4,  1, full faith and credit must be given by the courts of Missouri to this decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska. The respondents replied that the contract was made and delivered in Missouri and was to be construed and enforced according to Missouri law; that, at the date of its consummation, the petitioner had no license or authority to transact business in Missouri as a corporation or otherwise, and the certificate was therefore to be considered as issued pursuant to, and governed by, the general insurance laws of Missouri; that Bolin having fully performed in accordance with the terms of the certificate, the petitioner was estopped to plead ultra vires; and that in truth the contract was not ultra vires the petitioner.\n A jury was waived and the case was tried to the court. The respondents proved the issue of the certificate and Bolin's payments for twenty years thereafter. The petitioner proved the adoption of the by-law purporting to authorize the issue of 'payments to cease' certificates; and put in evidence an exemplified copy of the record in Trapp v. Sovereign Camp of the Woodmen of the World, 102 Neb. 562, 168 N.W. 191, wherein it was decided that petitioner never had power under the law of Nebraska to issue such a certificate. Judgment went for the re- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 66, 74]\n\u00a0\n spondents. The petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court of Missouri, which remanded the cause to the Kansas City Court of Appeals1 on the ground that it involved no constitutional question. The latter affirmed the judgment2 and adhered to its decision on rehearing. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The court below based its decision on the following grounds:\n'Under the law of Missouri the certificate was a Missouri contract because it was delivered to Bolin in Missouri and he made his payments there; all issues respecting rights arising out of the contract must, therefore, be adjudicated according to the decisions of the Missouri courts. The question then arises what system of local law is applicable,- that relating to fraternal beneficiary societies or that applicable to old line insurance companies. At the time the contract was made there was no local statute providing for the licensing of foreign fraternal beneficiary societies. Under the decisions of the Missouri courts the petitioner must, therefore, be denied the immunities extended by statute to domestic fraternal beneficiary associations and must be taken to have been doing business in Missouri under the State's general insurance laws, and the certificate must be regarded as a contract of general or old line insurance. This conclusion is not altered by the nature of the society granting the insurance because the character of the insurance, so far as Missouri is concerned, depends on the terms of the contract only. Whatever may be the character of the petitioner in the eye of the Nebraska law it need not have the same character in Missouri. Whether it is a fraternal beneficiary society when sued in Missouri is a question of local law. Even \n\n[305 \nU.S. 66, 75]\n\u00a0\n if the issue of the certificate be an ultra vires act under the law of Nebraska it does not follow that it is such under the law of Missouri. The contract is not ultra vires under the law of Missouri or, if so, the petitioner may not plead ultra vires because, in the light of Missouri law, the contract is an insurance contract with an old line insurance company and the petitioner, under Missouri decisions, cannot, in the circumstances disclosed, avail itself of the fact that the contract was in excess of its charter powers.'\n\n The court refused to give force or effect to the decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska in Trapp v. Woodmen, supra, saying that case did not hold the issue of such a certificate ultra vires in the sense that it was prohibited by positive statute; that the contract being a Missouri contract its ultra vires character must be adjudged by the local law irrespective of what the courts of the domicile had held; that the respondents in the present case relied on an estoppel of the petitioner to plead ultra vires, whereas no such issue was presented or decided in the Trapp Case.\n We hold that the judgment denied full faith and credit to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of the State of Nebraska.\n First. The beneficiary certificate was not a mere contract to be construed and enforced according to the laws of the state where it was delivered. Entry into membership of an incorporated beneficiary society is more than a contract; it is entering into a complex and abiding relation and the rights of membership are governed by the law of the state of incorporation. Another state, wherein the certificate of membership was issued, cannot attach to membership rights against the society which are refused by the law of the domicile. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 66, 76]\n\u00a0\n Second. The circumstance that at the time the certificate was issued domestic fraternal societies were exempted from the operation of the general insurance law of the state, and no similar exemption was extended to foreign societies, cannot enlarge the statutory and charter powers of such a foreign society. The fundamental error of the court below springs from a misapprehension of the effect to be given to the absence of provisions exempting foreign beneficiary associations from the statutes applicable generally to old line life insurance companies. Missouri has statutes affecting the validity and enforcibility of stipulations inserted in life insurance policies and other statutes dealing with procedure in actions upon such policies. In 1879 a statute was passed authorizing the incorporation of fraternal beneficiary societies and exempting them from the operation of the general laws of the State in respect of insurance companies. \n5\n An act of 1881 exempted both domestic and foreign societies from the operation of the general insurance laws. \n6\n This act did not require the registration of foreign associations but accorded them the same exemption as domestic associations. In 1889 the legislature adopted an act revising the statutes dealing with private corporations and therein provided that domestic beneficial societies should not be subject to the general insurance laws of the State, but omitted any reference to foreign associations. 7 It was not until 1897 that foreign beneficiary associations were required, as a condition of doing business within the state, to register and to file annual reports and to designate the Superintendent of the Insurance Department as the person upon whom process might be served. If they \n\n[305 \nU.S. 66, 77]\n\u00a0\n complied with the provisions of this statute they were exempted from the operation of the general insurance laws. \n8\n This act has been carried forward in later revisions and, with changes immaterial to our inquiry, remains in force. From this hiatus in the statutes governing foreign beneficiary associations it resulted that while foreign associations were not forbidden from organizing lodges, obtaining members, and issuing benefit certificates in Missouri, and their certificates so issued were not deemed to be void,9 certificates issued in the interim between 1889 and 1897 were construed in accordance with, and actions thereon were governed by, the provisions of the general insurance laws. \n10\n The Missouri courts, however, were apparently not called upon in any of the cases affected by this rule of decision to pass upon the question of the power of such a society, under the law of the state of its incorporation, to write a particular sort of beneficiary certificate;11 but this court reversed a judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri which, without reference to the distinction between the rule applicable to domestic and foreign societies, reexamined and refused to give effect to a judgment of the Supreme Court of Connecti- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 66, 78]\n\u00a0\n cut, the court of the domicile, with respect to the powers of a Connecticut association. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n The court below was not at liberty to disregard the fundamental law of the petitioner and turn a membership beneficiary certificate into an old line policy to be construed and enforced according to the law of the forum. The decision that the principle of ultra vires contracts was to be applied as if the petitioner were a Missouri old line life insurance company was erroneous in the light of the decisions of this court which have uniformly held that the rights of members of such associations are governed by the definition of the society's powers by the courts of its domicile. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n Third. The doctrine of estoppel was erroneously invoked to avoid the force and effect of the Nebraska judgment. The court below was of the opinion that, as the petitioner had issued a 'payments to cease after 20 years' certificate, and as Bolin had fully performed on his part by paying all dues and assessments over the named period, the petitioner was estopped to plead its lack of power to issue such a certificate. This again was on the theory that whatever might be the nature of the petitioner's organization in Nebraska, for the purposes of this action it must be treated as an old line insurance company in Missouri. It was further held that no question of estoppel was decided in the Trapp Case.\n As to the first of these positions, it need only be said that the Trapp Case was a class suit in which it was determined that the petitioner lacked power, under the law of Nebraska, to issue such certificates. In such a suit the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 66, 79]\n\u00a0\n association represents all its members and stands in judgment for them, and even though the suit had a different object than the instant one it is conclusive upon all the members of the association with respect to all rights, questions, or facts therein determined. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n With respect to the second position, it appears from the record that Trapp, in the suit in Nebraska, pleaded that the association was estopped to deny its power to issue the form of certificate in question and the opinion of the Nebraska court, by reference to a case decided on the same day, clearly indicates that the issue of estoppel was considered and determined adversely to the plaintiff.\n Fourth. Under our uniform holdings the court below failed to give full faith and credit to the petitioner's charter embodied in the statutes of Nebraska as interpreted by its highest court. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Bolin v.

Petitioners by pleas to \n\n[304 \nU.S. 295, 298]\n\u00a0\n the jurisdiction asserted that the questions raised were essentially administrative and that therefore resort must first be had to the Interstate Commerce Commission. The district court heard evidence on the issues tendered by the pleas, sustained the petitioners' contention and dismissed the case. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 5 Cir., 91 F.2d 502. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n302 \nU.S. 669\n, 58 S.Ct. 42, 82 L.Ed. --.\n The city of Brownsville is on the north side of the Rio Grande opposite Matamoros. The respondent Navigation District, called the 'Port of Brownsville,' was incorporated under Texas law;2 it includes a channel extending from the Gulf of Mexico about 17 miles to a turning basin which is located outside, and about five miles from the center of, Brownsville. The Port has no locomotive or cars; it has facilities at the basin to load and unload vessels, and a railroad track extending from the basin about a mile, to junction, at the boundary of the district, with a short branch or spur of petitioner, the Port Isabel & Rio Grande Valley Railway Company. Each of the other two respondents is engaged in business at the port as stevedore, freight broker, and forwarding agent. All the respondents are directly interested in the transportation of freight between the Port of Brownsville and points in Mexico via Matamoros.\n Petitioner Thompson, as trustee in proceedings under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  205, operates the St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railway and other lines of the Missouri Pacific System for transportation between gulf ports in Texas and Rio Grande crossings into Mexico. The Port Isabel, in all about 26 miles long, extends from the gulf to tracks operated by the trustee in the city of Brownsville. The Brownsville & Matamoros Bridge Company has a bridge and railroad tracks connecting the trustee's tracks in Brownsville with the National Rail- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 295, 299]\n\u00a0\n ways of Mexico in Matamoros. Shipments between the Port of Brownsville and Matamoros must move about a mile over the tracks of the Navigation District, 7.4 miles over the Port Isabel, 2.49 miles over the trustee's tracks and 1.24 miles over the Bridge Company's rails.\n There is no joint rate applicable to transportation between the Port and Matamoros or any other point in Mexico over the tracks of petitioners, the Bridge Company and any railway in Mexico. The service performed by each petitioner is covered by a switching charge specified in its tariff filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. Neither the tariff of the Port Isabel nor that of the trustee contains any rule, regulation, or provision relating to the furnishing of cars for the transportation in question. The Port Isabel performs the initial movement of traffic from the Port; it has no cars or means to acquire any. The Mexican National Railways are the initial carriers of traffic in the other direction; they refuse to permit their cars to leave Mexico.\n The trustee furnishes cars for transportation from the ports of Corpus Christi and Houston to gateways at Rio Grande crossings, including Laredo and Brownsville; in all that transportation he has substantial line hauls. But he refuses to permit cars delivered by him to the Port Isabel and taken by the latter to the basin for unloading to be reloaded for shipment into Mexico, and refuses to deliver to the Port Isabel cars under his control to be loaded at the Port; and if loaded there for transportation into Mexico he refuses to switch them en route. Without regard to ownership, control or distribution, the Port Isabel is willing to switch cars between the Port and its junction with the trustee's tracks.\n After the district court dismissed this case, respondents filed with the Commission a complaint alleging that petitioners, principally by their failure to furnish equipment, refused to permit traffic to move between the Port and Matamoros, in violation of sections 1 and 6 of the Interstate \n\n[304 \nU.S. 295, 300]\n\u00a0\n Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  1, 6, and that the trustee's refusal to permit such use of his equipment, while permitting it between other ports and Mexico, violates section 3 of the act, 49 U.S.C.A.  3. They prayed an order requiring petitioners to furnish equipment and to remove the prejudice and preference alleged. After hearing by the Commission but before its report, the Circuit Court of Appeals announced its decision, in which it held that the district court has jurisdiction to grant mandamus, notwithstanding the petition for the writ alleged unreasonable and prejudicial discrimination against the Port of Brownsville. After this Court granted the writ of certiorari, respondents filed a petition with the Commission asking it to defer action upon their allegations of violation of sections 1 and 6. And the Commission did limit its decision to alleged violations of section 3. It held that the refusal of the trustee to furnish cars was not unduly prejudicial or preferential.\n The respondents do not complain that petitioners refuse to switch cars furnished by other carriers or by the Port itself. Their grievance is not that petitioners refuse to do the switching covered by their tariffs at the specified rates; it is that in applying their tariffs, they discriminate against the Port of Brownsville in order to divert traffic to other ports and gateways so that the trustee may obtain substantial line hauls. The Act extends to transportation only so far as it takes place in this country. Petitioners are not bound by any law, regulation, or tariff to furnish cars for transportation in Mexico. But that freedom from obligation does not imply that, in furnishing equipment for transportation beyond the boundary, petitioners may unreasonably discriminate between shippers, places, or classes of traffic within the United States. Cf. Lewis, etc., Co. v. Southern Pac. Co., \n283 \nU.S. 654\n, 51 S.Ct. 592\n\n\n As the Port Isabel does not own or control any freight cars, respondents may not have relief on the ground that the failure of that carrier to furnish them is unreasonable \n\n[304 \nU.S. 295, 301]\n\u00a0\n discrimination. As the trustee participates in traffic between the basin and points in Mexico only to the extent of an intermediate switching movement, he is not, as a matter of law, bound to furnish cars even for the part of the transportation that is performed within the United States. The question, whether the discrimination in the application of his tariff covering the switching movement is unreasonable, is an administrative one. Appropriate consideration of it may extend to many facts and circumstances, including the influence, if any, of the discrimination upon the trustee's line hauls between other Texas ports and points in Mexico, and to the broad field of competition legitimately available to carriers, shippers and commodities seeking transportation between the United States and Mexico. And the ascertainment of appropriate remedy for discrimination condemned calls for another administrative determination involving, it may be, investigation of numerous conditions affecting transportation between the two countries. And as determination of reasonableness of petitioners' refusal to furnish cars for the transportation in question and the prescribing of change in the service, if any is to be ordered, are primarily within the regulatory powers of the Commission, the district court rightly held that it was without jurisdiction and dismissed the cause.

PAUL MERCURY INDEM. CO. v. RED CAB CO.(1938)\nNo. 274\nArgued: Decided: February 28, 1938\n\n\n\n Mr. Burke G. Slaymaker, of Indianapolis, Ind., for petitioner.\n Mr. William E. Reiley, of Indianapolis, Ind., for respondent. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 283, 284]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The decision under review is that, although, at the time of removal of a cause from a state court, the complaint disclosed an amount in controversy requisite to the federal court's jurisdiction, a subsequent amendment, reducing the sum claimed to substantially less than that amount, necessitates remand to the state court. We granted the writ of certiorari ( \n302 \nU.S. 669\n, 58 S.Ct. 38, 82 L.Ed. --) because of alleged conflict with our decisions and with those of other federal courts.\n The respondent, a corporation of Indiana, issued a summons out of the superior court of Marion county, Indiana, against the petitioner, a Minnesota corporation doing business in Indiana, and one Harlan as its agent. The complaint alleged that the respondent was subject to the provisions of the Indiana Workmen's Compensation Act, Acts 1929, c. 172, as amended, and had entered into a contract of insurance with the petitioner, evidenced by a binder, whereby the petitioner insured the respondent against loss or expense by reason of claims for compensation for a period of thirty days from December 30, 1933, and agreed to act for the respondent in the filing of reports and notices under the Act; that, during the term of the insurance employes of the respondent had suffered injury in the course of employment and made claims therefor; that the petitioner had been notified of each injury and investigated it in connection with the claim for compensation; that after the expiration of the contract the petitioner notified the respondent that it would not recognize any of the claims and denied liability under the binder; that as a consequence respondent was compelled to employ attorneys, investigators, and medical assistants to investigate and satisfy claims covered by the contract and to pay employes who had suffered injuries during the contract period, and \n\n[303 \nU.S. 283, 285]\n\u00a0\n to pay, or obligate itself to pay, for medical, hospital, or dental bills in connection with such injuries; to the damage of the respondent in the sum of $4,000. It was alleged that the petitioner had acted, in making the contract, through Harlan, its authorized agent and representative, and an order was prayed that Harlan retain all moneys due by him to the petitioner for the purpose of answering any judgment which might be recovered. The complaint concluded by demanding $4,000 and other appropriate relief. Upon the petitioner's timely application the cause was removed to the United States District Court for Southern Indiana. The respondent thereafter filed an amended complaint, the substance of which is not now material, and later a 'second amended complaint for breach of contract and for damages,' in which the allegations of the original complaint were repeated and damages were claimed in the sum of $4,000. An exhibit was attached which gave the names of the employes and the amounts expended in connection with their asserted injuries totaling $1,380.89. The court dismissed Harlan as a defendant, transferred the cause to the law docket, and overruled a demurrer to the complaint as not stating facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The answer denied the making of the contract. A jury trial was waived and the court made findings, stated its conclusions, and entered judgment for the respondent for $1,162. 98. The petitioner appealed. The Circuit Court of Appeals refused to decide the merits on the ground that as the record showed respondent's claim did not equal the amount necessary to give the District Court jurisdiction, the case should have been remanded to the State court. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The question presented is one of statutory construction. The act defining the jurisdiction of district courts of the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 283, 286]\n\u00a0\n United States is section 24 of the Judicial Code. \n2\n So far as here material, the Code confers jurisdiction of a suit of a civil nature, where the matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $3,000 and is between citizens of different states.\n Authority for removal of certain causes from a state to a federal court was first given by section 12 of the Judiciary Act of 17893 which permitted removal of a civil suit, instituted by a citizen of the state in which the suit was brought, against a citizen of another state, where the matter in dispute exceeded the sum or value of $500, exclusive of costs. Such removal could be had only at the instance of the nonresident defendant. The Act of July 27, 1866,4 enlarged the privilege of removal by providing that if, in such a civil suit, it was shown that a nonresident defendant was party to a separable controversy, which could be determined without the presence of other defendants, that defendant might remove the cause.\n The Judiciary Act of 18755 altered preexisting law to permit suits involving a controversy between citizens of different states to be removed by either party. The Judiciary Acts of 1887, 18886 increased the jurisdictional amount to more than $2,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and confined the right of removal to a nonresident defendant, and the Judicial Code increased the limit to over $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and also restricted the privilege to nonresident defendants. \n7\n The \n\n[303 \nU.S. 283, 287]\n\u00a0\n statute governing dismissal or remand for want of jurisdiction is section 37 of the Judicial Code:8\n'If in any suit commenced in a district court, or removed from a State court to a district court of the United States, it shall appear to the satisfaction of the said district court, at any time after such suit has been brought or removed thereto, that such suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of said district court, or that the parties to said suit have been improperly or collusively made or joined, either as plaintiffs or defendants, for the purpose of creating a case cognizable or removable under this chapter, the said district court shall proceed no further therein, but shall dismiss the suit or remand it to the court from which it was removed, as justice may require, and shall make such order as to costs as shall be just.'\n\n This provision first appeared as section 59 of the Act of March 3, 1875 (supra), and save for the elision of a concluding clause, and the substitution of 'district court' for 'circuit court' is identical with that section. It was included in the Judiciary Acts of 1887, 1888 supra, and has been continuously in force since 1875. It altered the practice by requiring the court to dismiss or remand of its own motion in a proper case although want of jurisdiction was not raised by appropriate motion or by plea or answer,10 but did not change the substantial basis for \n\n[303 \nU.S. 283, 288]\n\u00a0\n the court's action. The principles governing dismissal of a cause intiated in the federal court or the remand of one begun in a state court have remained as they were before the section was adopted.\n The intent of Congress drastically to restrict federal jurisdiction in controversies between citizens of different states has always been rigorously enforced by the courts. The rule governing dismissal for want of jurisdiction in cases brought in the federal court is that, unless the law gives a different rule, the sum claimed by the plaintiff controls11 if the claim is apparently made in good faith. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 283, 289]\n\u00a0\n It must appear to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount to justify dismissal. \n13\n The inability of plaintiff to recover an amount adequate to give the court jurisdiction does not show his bad faith or oust the jurisdiction. \n14\n Nor does the fact that the complaint discloses the existence of a valid defense to the claim. 15 But if, from the face of the pleadings, it is apparent, to a legal certainty, that the plaintiff cannot recover the amount claimed or if, from the proofs, the court is satisfied to a like certainty that the plaintiff never was entitled to recover that amount, and that his claim was therefore colorable for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction, the suit will be dismissed. \n16\n Events oc- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 283, 290]\n\u00a0\n curring subsequent to the institution of suit which reduce the amount recoverable below the statutory limit do not oust jurisdiction. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n What already has been said, and circumstances later to be discussed lead to the conclusion that a dismissal would not have been justified had the suit been brought in the federal court. The principles which govern remand of a removed cause, more urgently require that it should not have been remanded. In a cause instituted in the federal court the plaintiff chooses his forum. He knows or should know whether his claim is within the statutory requirement as to amount. His good faith in choosing the federal forum is open to challenge not only by resort to the face of his complaint, but by the facts disclosed at trial, and if from either source it is clear that his claim never could have amounted to the sum necessary to give jurisdiction there is no injustice in dismissing the suit. Indeed, this is the court's duty under the Act of 1875. In such original actions it may also well be that plaintiff and defendant have colluded to confer jurisdiction by the method of the one claiming a fictitious amount and the other failing to deny the veracity of the averment of amount in controversy. Upon disclosure of that state of facts the court should dismiss.\n A different situation is presented in the case of a suit instituted in a state court and thence removed. There is a strong presumption that the plaintiff has not claimed a large amount in order to confer jurisdiction on a federal court or that the parties have colluded to that end. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 283, 291]\n\u00a0\n For if such were the purpose suit would not have been instituted in the first instance in the state but in the federal court. It is highly unlikely that the parties would pursue this roundabout and troublesome method to get into the federal court by removal when by the same device the suit could be instituted in that court. \n19\n Moreover, the status of the case as disclosed by the plaintiff's complaint is controlling in the case of a removal, since the defendant must file his petition before the time for answer or forever lose his right to remove. \n20\n Of course, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 283, 292]\n\u00a0\n if, upon the face of the complaint, it is obvious that the suit cannot involve the necessary amount, removal will be futile and remand will follow. \n21\n But the fact that it appears from the face of the complaint that the defendant has a valid defense, if asserted, to all or a portion of the claim, or the circumstance that the rulings of the district court after removal reduce the amount recoverable below the jurisdictional requirement, 22 will not justify remand. And though, as here, the plaintiff after removal, by stipulation, by affidavit, or by amendment of his pleadings, reduces the claim below the requisite amount, this does not deprive the district court of jurisdiction. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 283, 293]\n\u00a0\n Thus events occurring subsequent to removal which reduce the amount recoverable, whether beyond the plaintiff's control or the result of his volition, do not oust the district court's jurisdiction once it has attached. 24 This is well illustrated by Kirby v. American Soda Fountain Company, \n194 \nU.S. 141\n, 24 S.Ct. 619, 621, where in a suit brought by Kirby he alleged that he was induced by the company's false representations to agree to the exchange of his apparatus for one made by the defendant and to pay $2025 in addition. He prayed the cancellation of his obligation to pay the balance of $2,025, damages of $2,500, and general relief. The cause was removed to the circuit court. The company answered denying Kirby's charges of fraud, relied upon a written agreement alleged to contain all the terms of the contract, asserted full performance on its part, and that he had paid but $325 on his obligation to pay $2,025. By cross-complaint, the company demanded $1,700 and interest from Kirby and the establishment of a lien on the apparatus delivered to him. Kirby answered that he had voluntarily dismissed the original suit brought by him and that the cross-bill was not within the jurisdiction of the court because it did not claim in excess of $2,000, exclusive of interest and costs. The plea was overruled and judgment rendered on the cross-complaint. In affirming the court referred to the amount demanded in Kirby's original complaint and said: 'The matter in dispute having thus been made to exceed the sum or value of $2,000, exclusive of interest and costs, defendant presented his petition and bond for removal, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 283, 294]\n\u00a0\n and the cause was thereupon removed. The jurisdiction thus acquired by the circuit court was not devested by plaintiff's subsequent action.'\n Fifty years earlier in Kanouse v. Martin, 15 How. 198, the court had held that voluntary reduction of the amount demanded below the sum necessary to give the circuit court jurisdiction could not defeat that jurisdiction once removal proceedings had been perfected. In reliance upon these precedents many cases, cited in Note 23, have been decided.\n We think this well established rule is supported by ample reason. If the plaintiff could, no matter how bona fide his original claim in the state court, reduce the amount of his demand to defeat federal jurisdiction the defendant's supposed statutory right of removal would be subject to the plaintiff's caprice. The claim, whether well or ill founded in fact, fixes the right of the defendant to remove, and the plaintiff ought not to be able to defeat that right and bring the cause back to the state court at his election. If he does not desire to try his case in the federal court he may resort to the expedient of suing for less than the jurisdictional amount, and though he would be justly entitled to more, the defendant cannot remove. \n25\n\u00a0\n\n This view is further supported by the authorities as to causes in which jurisdiction depends on diversity of citizenship. It uniformly has been held that in a suit properly begun in the federal court the change of citizenship of a party does not oust the jurisdiction. \n26\n The same \n\n[303 \nU.S. 283, 295]\n\u00a0\n rule governs a suit originally brought in a state court and removed to a federal court. \n27\n\u00a0\n\n The decisions as to remand of a cause removed because it involves a separable controversy are not inconsistent with those concerning remand for lack of jurisdictional amount. In the case of a separable controversy, if, after removal, the plaintiff discontinues or dismisses as to the defendant who removed, so that there no longer exists any separable controversy, the cause must be remanded. \n28\n If a cause be removed on this ground the whole case, including the controversy between citizens of the same state, is taken over by the federal court only because one or more of the defendants is entitled to invoke its jurisdiction. The basis of federal jurisdiction failing, it is proper that the remaining parties, who were involuntarily taken into the federal court, should, upon the cessation of the separable controversy which was the cause of their transmission to another tribunal, have their case returned to the state court.\n The present case well illustrates the propriety of the rule that subsequent reduction of the amount claimed cannot oust the district court's jurisdiction. Suit was instituted in the State court June 5, 1934. The lump sum claimed was largely in excess of $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs. The items which went to make up the respondent's demand for indemnity were numerous and \n\n[303 \nU.S. 283, 296]\n\u00a0\n each, in turn was itself the total of several items of expenditure or liability. There is nothing to indicate that all of the sums for which reimbursement was claimed had actually been expended prior to the beginning of suit or that the sums thereafter to be expended had been ascertained. Not until the second amended complaint was filed in the United States court, in November 1934, did the respondent furnish a statement of the particulars of its claim. That statement is not inconsistent with the making of a claim in good faith for over $3,000 when the suit was instituted. Nor is there evidence that the petitioner when it removed the cause knew, or had reason to believe, that the respondent's claim, whether well or ill founded in law or fact involved less than $3, 000. On the face of the pleadings petitioner was entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal court and a reduction of the amount claimed after removal, did not take away that privilege.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n So ordered.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 7 Cir., 90 F.2d 229. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231,  24, 36 Stat. 1091, as amended, U.S. C. tit. 28,  41, 28 U.S.C.A.  41. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Act of Sept. 24, 1789,  12, 1 Stat. 73, 79. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Chapter 288, 14 Stat. 306. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Act of March 3, 1887,  1, 24 Stat. 552; Act of Aug. 13, 1888,  1, 25 Stat. 433. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231,  24, 28, 36 Stat. 1087, 1091, 1094, 28 U.S.C.A.  41, 71. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231,  37, 36 Stat. 1098, U.S.C., tit. 28 ,  80, 28 U.S.C.A.  80. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] 18 Stat. 472. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] Prior to 1875 the courts did not act of their own motion, but upon a motion to dismiss or a plea in abatement.

Greenhow, \n109 \nU.S. 669\n, 3 S.Ct. 421, 422, a case of trespass for entering plaintiff's premises and carrying away goods of the value of $100, interfering with plaintiff's business, annoying and disturbing him, &c., the damages were laid at $6,000. Though there was not diversity of citizenship, as the pleadings raised a federal question, the cause was removed. It was remanded as the circuit court thought there was no federal question involved. The decision was reversed. Speaking of the facts disclosed the court said: 'There is a ground for remanding the cause suggested by the record, but not sufficiently apparent to justify us in resorting to it to support the action of the circuit court. \n The value of the property taken is stated in the declaration to be but $ 100, although the damages for the alleged trespass are laid at $6,000 . ... We cannot, of course, assume, as a matter of law, that the amount laid, or a less amount, greater than $500, is not recoverable upon the case stated in the declaration, and cannot, therefore, justify the order remanding the cause, on the ground that the matter in dispute does not exceed the sum or value of $500. But if the circuit court had found, as matter of fact, that the amount of damages stated in the declaration was colorable, and had been laid beyond the amount of a reasonable expectation of recovery, for the purpose of creating a case removable under the act of congress, so that, in the words of the fifth section of the act of 1875, it appeared that the suit 'did not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of said circuit court,' the order remanding it to the state court could have been sustained.'

VIDAL(1938)\nNo. 12\nArgued: Decided: November 7, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 61, 62]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thornton Hardie, of El Paso, Tex., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Golden W. Bell, Asst. Sol. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We are to decide whether the petitioners may maintain an action to recover from a collector of internal revenue sums paid by them as taxes assessed under the Bankhead Cotton Act. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n During the crop year 1934-1935 the petitioner were engaged in growing cotton and produced a quantity in excess of the allotment for which, under the terms of the Act, they were entitled to obtain tax exemption certificates. Petitioners delivered the excess cotton to Santo Tomas Gin Company, which ginned it and filed returns with the respondent, as collector, showing a tax of some $13,000 due on the ginning. The respondent, as directed by the Act, assessed the tax against the gin company. The latter refused to deliver the cotton to the petitioners until \n\n[305 \nU.S. 61, 63]\n\u00a0\n the tax was paid, and to obtain their cotton the petitioners, in November 1934 and January 1935, paid the tax to the respondent. March 6, 1935 they presented a claim for refund, which was rejected by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue August 22, 1935. Suit was brought against the respondent May 5, 1936, to recover the amount paid with interest, the petitioners alleging that the Bankhead Act was unconstitutional. This the answer denied, and set up the further defense that, under the Act, the petitioners were not liable for the tax, any payment they had made was in discharge of a liability imposed by the Act on the gin company, and, consequently, they were not entitled to maintain the action.\n The District Court, a jury having been waived, held that the Act was unconstitutional, that the petitioners could maintain the action, and gave judgment for them. The Circuit Court of Appeals refused to pass upon the constitutional question, as it was of opinion that the trial court erred in sustaining the petitioners' standing, and reversed the judgment. \n2\n On account of the importance of the case we granted certiorari, \n304 \nU.S. 552\n, 58 S.Ct. 943, limited, however, to the question whether the petitioners were the proper parties to maintain the action.\n Section 20(b) of the Bankhead Act3 stated the conditions upon which a proceeding might be maintained for the recovery of any sum alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected under its terms. The Act was repealed February 10, 1936,4 prior to the institution of the instant action. The petitioners were therefore remitted for recovery of the sum demanded to R.S.  3226, as amended by the Act of June 6, 1932,  1103(a).5 As thereby required, they timely filed a claim for refund, \n\n[305 \nU.S. 61, 64]\n\u00a0\n which was denied, and timely brought their action. Under this section it is unnecessary to plead or prove that the tax was paid under protest or its collection was accomplished by duress.\n The sole question for decision is whether the petitioners voluntarily paid someone's else tax. If they did they may not maintain the action. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The respondent insists that, by the terms of the Act, the tax is imposed upon the ginner and not upon the producer. The petitioners, on the other hand, point to the provisions of the Act which make the levy of the tax dependent upon the vote of cotton producers and not upon any act of the ginners; which base exemptions from the tax upon the time, manner, and character of production and not upon the time, manner, or character of ginning; which grant exemptions to producers, not to ginners; which condition exemptions upon the producers meeting certain conditions and limitations; and which fix quotas for exemptions to producers. They say Congress never intended the ginner should bear the tax since the Act provides that he is to be reimbursed up to twenty-five cents per bale for additional expense incurred by him in connection with the administration of the Act. They assert that the respondent's contention that the tax is upon the ginning of the cotton is negatived by the fact that it is not assessed upon all cotton ginned regardless of the amount produced by the owner of the particular farm, and that it amounts per bale to approximately five times the amount of the customary charge for ginning. They call especial attention to those sections of the Act which impose a lien for the tax upon the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 61, 65]\n\u00a0\n cotton if it is removed from the gin, forbid transportation of the cotton- the producers' property,-beyond the county where produced except for storage, and prohibit opening of the bale or sale of the cotton until the tax shall have been paid. They say it is obvious the statute made the ginner a convenient collecting agent to enforce payment of the tax and that the purpose was to force the farmer to pay by prohibiting his use of his excess cotton unless and until he paid; and the latter is, therefore, entitled to maintain an action for the refund of the tax if it was illegally collected.\n We hold that the petitioner are entitled to maintain the action. The purpose of the Bankhead Act was to restrict the production of cotton and, to that end, to levy a heavy tax in respect of that produced in excess of the farmer's quota. The tax bore no relation to the ginning of cotton. On the contrary, it was intended to fall, and the Act attempted to make it fall, upon the producers. The assessment of the tax against the ginner was intended to immobilize the cotton in his possession until the producer should liquidate the tax. This is evident from the provisions which impose a lien upon the cotton for the amount of the tax upon removal of it from the gin without payment of the tax and while permitting it to be stored by the producer, forbid the opening of a bale or the sale of it until the tax liability shall have been discharged. Plainly the purpose was that if the ginner should release the cotton to the producer while the tax remained unpaid the lien upon it would insure payment by the producer.\n The scheme of the Act sets the case apart from any to which our attention has been called arising under other taxing acts. The collector was part of the machinery for compelling the farmer to pay the tax, for immobilizing the cotton and making it unusable until the assess \n\n[305 \nU.S. 61, 66]\n\u00a0\n ment he had made against the ginner was satisfied by payment of the tax. Whether or not the tax was imposed upon the petitioners, they are, according to accepted principles, entitled to recover unless they were volunteers, which they plainly were not because they paid the tax under duress of goods.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of April 21, 1934, c. 157, 48 Stat. 598, 7 U.S.C.A.  701 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Vidal v.

Wylie, both of St. Petersburg, Fla., for petitioner.\n Mr. John Bell, of Tampa, Fla., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner is surety on a post office construction bond given pursuant to the Act of Congress approved August 13, 1894, c. 280, 28 Stat. 278, as amended, title 40 U.S.C.A.  270, which provides:\n'Any person or persons entering into a formal contract with the United States for the construction of any \n\n[302 \nU.S. 442, 443]\n\u00a0\n public building, or the prosecution and completion of any public work, or for repairs upon any public building or public work, shall be required, before commencing such work, to execute the usual penal bond, with good and sufficient sureties, with the additional obligation that such contractor or contractors shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying him or them with labor and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract; and any person, company, or corporation who has furnished labor or materials used in the construction or repair of any public building or public work, and payment for which has not been made, shall have the right to intervene and be made a party to any action instituted by the United States on the bond of the contractor, and to have their rights and claims adjudicated in such action and judgment rendered thereon, subject, however, to the priority of the claim and judgment of the United States.'\n\n Respondent, common carrier by railroad, having transported material for the structure, sued on the bond to recover freight charges and prevailed in both courts below. They held it was a 'corporation who has furnished labor or materials used in the construction' of a public building. The correctness of this conclusion is the only question before us.\n The cause is here because of conflicting opinions in Circuit Courts of Appeals. United States, etc., v. Hyatt, 5 Cir., 92 F. 442; Title Guaranty & Trust Co. v. Puget Sound Engine Works, 9 Cir., 163 F. 168; Mandel et al. v. United States, etc., 3 Cir., 4 F.2d 629; Maryland Casualty Co. v.

United States, etc., 5 Cir., 89 F.2d 658.\n Petitioner maintains that freight cannot be considered as 'labor or material' without doing violence to the words \n\n[302 \nU.S. 442, 444]\n\u00a0\n of the statute; also that Congress did not intend to extend further protection to carriers who could enforce their lien for charges by retaining and selling the materials.\n City of Stuart, etc., v. American Surety Co., supra, Circuit Court of Appeals Fifth Circuit, 1930, carefully considered and denied these defenses and stated reasons therefor which we deem adequate. This was followed by the court below in present cause.\n The statute often has been before us. Guaranty Company v. Pressed Brick Co., \n191 \nU.S. 416\n, 24 S.Ct. 142; United States, for Use of Hill, v. American Surety Co. of New York, \n200 \nU.S. 197, 201\n, 26 S. Ct. 168; Title Guaranty & Trust Co. v.

And we are committed to the doctrine that it should be liberally construed in aid of the evident public object-security to those who contribute labor or material for public works.\n Certainly labor is required for loading freight on railroad cars, moving these over the road, and unloading at destination. A carrier who has procured the doing of all this in respect of material has 'furnished labor.' If a contractor had employed men to move the same kind of material in wheelbarrows, there could be no doubt that he furnished labor. In principle the mere use of cars and track and a longer haul creates no materially different situation.\n Nor do we find reason for excluding the carrier from the benefit of the bond because it might have enforced payment by withholding delivery. The words of the enactment are broad enough to include a carrier with a lien. Nothing in its purpose requires exclusion of a railroad. Refusal by the carrier to deliver material until all charges \n\n[302 \nU.S. 442, 445]\n\u00a0\n were paid might seriously impede the progress of public works, possibly frustrate an important undertaking.\n State for Use of Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. ( 1929) 4 W.W.Harr., Del., 158, 145 A. 172, gave much consideration to a similar statute. The conclusion there reached accords with our view.\n The judgment of the court below must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE FARM MUT. AUTOMOBILE INS. CO. v. COUGHRAN(1938)\nNo. 519\nArgued: March 4, 1938Decided: March 28, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 485, 486]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joseph A. Spray, of Los Angeles, Cal., and Sidney L. Graham, of Bloomington, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Raymond G. Stanbury, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner's policy insured one R. O. Anthony, the owner, against liability for injuries caused by a designated automobile. As the result of alleged negligent and unlawful action by the assured's wife the car collided with a truck June 16, 1934. Respondent Coughran suffered injuries for which he recovered judgment against Anthony, also against his wife. Both were insolvent; a writ of execution against them was returned unsatisfied.\n Thereupon respondent commenced this suit to recover of petitioner the amount of his unpaid judgment. He claimed this right under the policy and statute. Answering, the company exhibited the policy and denied liability. As a first separate defense it alleged that Anthony and his wife had not complied with certain terms of the contract. As a second: 'That said accident was an accident for which the defendant under the terms and conditions of said policy is not liable in that: At the time and place of the accident the automobile of the insured was being driven and operated by a person who was not the paid driver of the insured, nor a member of his immediate family, nor a person acting under the direction of the assured. This defendant alleges that the said automobile at the time of the accident was being driven and operated by a person in violation of the laws of the State of California as to age and as to driver's license and further alleges \n\n[303 \nU.S. 485, 487]\n\u00a0\n that the driver of said car was a minor, being a female of the age of approximately 13 years.'\n There were other separate defenses.\n A jury having been waived, the cause went to the court on the pleadings and evidence. It made findings of fact with conclusion of law and entered judgment for Coughran. Neither side requested other or different findings.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals thought findings III and XII were inconsistent 'and to elucidate the truth, a review of the testimony is required.' After such review it ruled that the findings so elucidated were adequate and required affirmation of the challenged judgment. One judge thought otherwise and presented a separate opinion.\n Under applicable statutes and repeated rulings here, the matter open for consideration upon the appeal was whether the findings of the trial court supported its judgment. To review the evidence was beyond the competency of the court. 28 U.S.C.A.  773, 875; Walnut v. Wade, \n103 \nU.S. 683\n, 688; Stanley v. Board of Supervisors of Albany County, \n121 \nU.S. 535, 547\n, 7 S.Ct. 1234; Law v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 494, 496\n, 45 S.Ct. 175, 176.\n Two persons were in the insured automobile when the accident occurred. Nancy Leidendeker, a girl of 13 without license to drive, occupied the driver's seat. By her side sat Helen B. Anthony, wife of the assured, an adult holding a driver's license.\n The principal point upon which the petitioner now relies is that as the accident occurred when the car was being driven and operated by the young girl contrary to the owner's commands and in violation of California statutes, the policy did not cover his liability.\n The policy (incorporated in the findings) under the heading 'Terms and Conditions Forming a Part of This Policy,' provides:\n'(1) Risks Not Assumed by This Company. The Company shall not be liable and no liability or obligation \n\n[303 \nU.S. 485, 488]\n\u00a0\n of any kind shall attach to the Company for loss or damage: ... (A ) ... (D) Unless the said automobile is being operated by the Assured, his paid driver, members of his immediate family, or persons acting under the direction of the Assured; (E) Caused while the said automobile is being driven or operated by any person whatsoever either under the influence of liquor or drugs or violating any law or ordinance as to age or driving license; (F) ...'\n\n Applicable sections of the California Vehicle Act,-Stats. 1923, pp. 518, 519, 536; Stats.1927, p. 1427; Stats.1931, p. 2108-follow:\n'Section 1. The following words and phrases used in this act shall have the meanings here ascribed to them.'\n\n'Sec. 18. 'Operator.' Every person who drives, operates or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon a public highway.'\n\n'Sec. 76. Unlawful to employ unlicensed chauffeur. No person shall employ for hire as a chauffeur of a motor vehicle, any person not licensed as in this act provided. No person shall authorize or knowingly permit a motor vehicle owned by him or under his control, to be driven by any person who has no legal right to do so or in violation of the provisions of this act.'\n\n'Sec. 58. Operators and chauffeurs must be licensed.\n\n'(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to drive a motor vehicle upon any public highway in this state, whether as an operator or a chauffeur, unless such person has been licensed as an operator or chauffeur; except such persons as are expressly exempted under this act.' Exception not applicable here.\n\n'Sec. 64. What persons shall not be licensed as operators or chauffeurs.\n\n'(a) An operator's license shall not be issued to any person under the age of sixteen years and no chauffeur's license shall be issued to any person under the age of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 485, 489]\n\u00a0\n eighteen years, provided that an operator's license may be issued to any minor over the age of fourteen years and less than sixteen years of age upon special application and statement of reasons by the parent or guardian of such minor.'\n\n Especially pertinent findings by the trial court follow:\n'III. The court finds that on or about the 16th day of June, 1934, and while said policy was in full force and effect, one Helen B. Anthony operated the Chevrolet automobile referred to in and covered by the said policy of insurance with the permission and consent of the assured, R. O. Anthony, and operated the same negligently so as proximately to cause an accident and injury to the person and property of the plaintiff to his damage in the reasonable sum of Five Thousand Ninety-two and 55\/100 Dollars ($5092.55).'\n\n'IX. The court finds that it is true that the defendant, prior to the trial of the action in the state court entered into the non-waiver agreement received in evidence in this action with the assured, R. O. Anthony, and with Helen B. Anthony. That the said non-waiver agreement was executed just prior to the commencement of the trial of the state court action. That the plaintiff was not a party to that agreement and had no knowledge of any facts referred to therein and was not in privity with any of the defendants in the state court action and that so far as the conduct of the defendant affects the plaintiff in this action, the defendant managed and conducted the defense in the state court.'\n\n'XII. With regard to the second separate defense of defendant, the court finds that the said automobile at the time of the impact that resulted in the injury to the plaintiff was being jointly operated by Helen B. Anthony and Nancy Leidendeker; that said Helen B. Anthony was a member of the assured's immediate family and was an adult person over the age of twenty-one (21) years \n\n[303 \nU.S. 485, 490]\n\u00a0\n who was licensed by the State of California to drive an automobile; and that said Nancy Leidendeker was a minor and not permitted under the applicable laws to operate a motor vehicle in the State of California; that the assured had forbidden said minor Nancy Leidendeker to drive any motor vehicle or automobile of which he was the owner or which he controlled; and that the action of said Nancy Leidendeker on the day of the accident and at the time of the impact involved in this action were in disobedience of and contrary to the commands, orders and instructions of the assured, R. O. Anthony; that at the time of the accident, insofar as the propulsion of the vehicle was concerned, other than the means of direction, all instrumentalities of said automobile were being physically actuated by said minor Nancy Leidendeker, with the acquiescence and knowledge of Helen B. Anthony and without any knowledge, acquiescence or consent on the part of the assured, R. O. Anthony; that the proximate and direct cause of the collision between the insured automobile and a truck owned by San Pedro Commercial Company was the act of Helen B. Anthony in seizing the steering wheel of the automobile at and immediately preceding the moment of impact and collision.'\n\n'XVI. That prior to the commencement of the trial of the said State court action the defendant had full knowledge of all the facts and circumstances concerning the presence of the said Nancy Leidendeker in the driver's seat or in a part of said seat, and all other facts relied on by the defendant as constituting a concealment and a defense of the case at bar, but that the defendant did not reveal said facts to the plaintiff or his counsel, and that plaintiff and his counsel had no knowledge that the said Nancy Leidendeker occupied any part of the driver's seat until said trial was completed.'\n\n'XVII. The court finds that prior to the collision between the insured automobile and a truck owned by the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 485, 491]\n\u00a0\n San Pedro Commercial Company, Helen B. Anthony seized the steering wheel of the insured automobile and steered the same to the right, proximately causing the same to come into collision with the said truck and proximately causing the same to turn to its right, proximately causing the collision of plaintiff's car and the injuries and damages suffered by him.'\n\n When read together no material conflict exists between findings III and XII; there is no real difficulty in understanding the circumstances to which they are addressed. The first contains statements concerning the conduct of one in authority; the second describes in detail what really took place at the moment of collision. The word 'operate' has varying meanings according to the context. Webster's New International Dictionary. One may operate singly with his own hands, or jointly with another, or through one or more agents.\n From the findings it appears that when the accident occurred the automobile was not being operated by the assured, his paid driver, a member of his immediate family or a person acting under his direction, within fair intendment of the policy. Contrary to the owner's commands 'insofar as the propulsion of the vehicle was concerned, other than the means of direction, all instrumentalities of said automobile were being physically actuated by said minor' who was inhibited by the statutes from driving or operating a motor vehicle within the State.\n Just before the accident, Mrs. Anthony seized the steering wheel and by negligent manipulation of this caused the collision.\n If, as found, the automobile was being jointly operated by the wife and the girl the risk was not within the policy. The latter the forbidden by law to operate or drive jointly or singly. If the wife was in control the statute forbade her to permit driving by the girl. In any view, when the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 485, 492]\n\u00a0\n collision occurred the car was being driven or operated in violation of the statutes.\n In support of his position respondent relies heavily upon O'Connell v. New Jersey Fidelity & Plate Glass Ins. Co., 201 App.Div. 117, 193 N.Y.S. 911; and Williams v. Nelson, 228 Mass. 191, 117 N.E. 189, Ann.Cas.1918D, 538. These causes, we think, are not in point. They were decided upon facts and circumstances materially different from those here disclosed.\n Respondent further submits that petitioner is precluded from any inquiry concerning who actually was driving the car when the accident occurred. He says the entire sequence of events surrounding Nancy Leidendeker was highly material and should have been litigated in the original tort action brought by Coughran against the Anthonys, and based solely upon permissive use. Also, if the facts then known by petitioner had been there revealed, it would have become apparent that the girl lacked permission to drive and that the wife exceeded the terms of her authorization; and that by suppressing these facts petitioner exposed the assured to a liability which otherwise might not have been imposed.\n The judgment roll of the tort action is not before us; we are limited to the findings. That action was defended by the petitioner under a nonwaiver agreement; the complaint alleged damages from negligence of the wife as driver and operator imputed to the husband. Defenses now presented by the Insurance Company against liability under the policy were not involved. Joint driving by Mrs. Anthony and the girl was not subject to inquiry.\n Moreover, in the circumstances we may not conclude that respondent should prevail because petitioner failed to present facts in the tort action which he says if then presented might have defeated the very judgment upon which he now relies to support his claim. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 485, 493]\n\u00a0\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed. The cause will be remanded to the District Court with instructions to enter judgment for the Insurance Company, petitioner here.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","146":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF CALIFORNIA v. LATIMER(1938)\nNo. 13\nArgued: November 7, 1938Decided: December 5, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 255, 256]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lucas E. Kilkenny and U.S. Webb, both of San Francisco, Cal., for the State of California.\n Mr. Warner W. Gardner, of Washington, D.C., for defendants.\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 255, 257]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n California owns the railroad along the San Francisco water front known as State Belt Railroad, and operates it in interstate commerce. Sherman v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 25\n, 51 S.Ct. 41; United States v. California, \n297 \nU.S. 175\n, 56 S.Ct. 421. On leave granted (58 S.Ct. 1036), the State filed in this court this bill against the members of the Railroad Retirement Board and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, individually and in their official capacities, to enjoin them from enforcing against that railroad provisions of the Acts of Congress known as the Railroad Retirement Acts of 1935 and 19371 and of the Carriers Taxing Act of 1937.2\n The bill recites that California has a State Employees' Retirement system sustained by a fund to which the State and its employees contribute; and that all the persons employed in the operation of State Belt Railroad are members of that retirement system and are entitled to pensions thereunder, unless they are members of a retirement system supported wholly, or in part, by funds of the United States; that the three Acts of Congress named have for their sole purpose the establishment of a pension system of annuities and other benefits for employees of interstate railroads; and that the federal system is sustained by taxes imposed by the Carriers Taxing Act. The bill asserts, apparently, that as a matter of statutory construction, the federal system is not applicable to the employees of State Belt Railroad; and apparently that if construed as applicable to them, the legislation is unconstitutional. The bill charges that the Railroad Retirement Board has threatened to require the complainant to gather and keep records concerning the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 255, 258]\n\u00a0\n employees of the State Belt Railroad, which would subject it 'to great expense'; and that the Board 'will enforce against the complainant, its officers, agents, and employees certain penalties if it refuses' to do so. The bill charges, also, that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has threatened to enforce taxes, under the Carriers Taxing Act, and will subject it to heavy fines and penalties if it fails to pay the same. The relief prayed is that the three Acts of Congress be declared inapplicable to State Belt Railroad; that the members of the Railroad Retirement Board be enjoined, among other things, from requiring the railroad to assemble and furnish the information requested; and that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue be enjoined from enforcing collection of the taxes claimed.\n The defendants moved to dismiss the bill, assigning therefor nine grounds. We need consider only the objection that the bill is without equity. \n3\n For we are of opin- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 255, 259]\n\u00a0\n ion that there was adequate opportunity to test at law the applicability and constitutionality of the Acts of Congress; and that no danger is shown of irreparable injury if that course is pursued.\n First. The alleged threat of the Railroad Retirement Board to require State Belt Railroad to gather and keep records of its employees does not expose it to irreparable injury. The Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 provides:\n'(Sec. 8.) Employers shall file with the Board, in such manner and form and at such times as the Board by rules and regulations may prescribe, returns under oath of monthly compensation of employees, and, if the Board shall so require, shall furnish employees with statements of their monthly compensation as reported to the Board. ...\n\n'(Sec. 10(b) 4.) ... The Board shall have power to require all employers and employees and any officer, board, commission, or other agency of the United States to furnish such information and records as shall be necessary for the administration of such Acts. The several district courts of the United States and the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia shall have jurisdiction upon suit by the Board to compel obedience to any order of the Board issued pursuant to this section. ...\n\n'(Sec. 13.) Any officer or agent of an employer ... who shall willfully fail or refuse to make any report or furnish any information required, in accordance with the provisions of section 10(b) 4, (section 228j(b) 4), by the Board ... shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000 or by imprisonment not exceeding one year.' 45 U.S.C.A.  228h, 228j(b)(4), 228m.\n\n The only 'threats' made against the complainant in connection with these sections is a ruling by the Railroad Retirement Board that the State Belt Railroad is subject to the Railroad Retirement Acts. No specific action in relation to that railroad appears to have been taken \n\n[305 \nU.S. 255, 260]\n\u00a0\n by the Board. \n4\n Regulations have been prescribed under sections 8 and 10 which are simple and of a type which can be complied with largely by transcriptions from payrolls. 5 The bill alleges that compliance with the regulations would subject the State 'to great expense.' No supporting detail or specification is given. Such a general statement is not an adequate basis for relief on the ground of irreparable damages. \n6\n The trifling expense of temporarily complying with the regulation until the applicability of the Act shall have been judicially determined, like the expense of the administrative hearings complained of in Myers v. Bethlehem Shipping Corporation, \n303 \nU.S. 41, 50\n, 51 S., 58 S.Ct. 459, 463, 464, and Petroleum Exploration, Inc., v. Public Service Commission, \n304 \nU.S. 209, 220\n, 221 S., 58 S.Ct. 834, 840, 841, is not sufficient to support the claim of irreparable injury indispensable to interposition by injunction. Compare Spielman Motor Sales Co. v. Dodge, \n295 \nU.S. 89, 95\n, 96 S., 55 S.Ct. 678, 680, 681\n\n\n Moreover, the Board is without power to enforce its regulations except by resort to legal proceedings, as provided in Section 10(b) 4; and in any suit which it may institute to enforce the regulations7 ample opportunity is afforded to defend, on the ground that State Belt Railroad is not subject to the Railroad Retirement Acts. It is contended \n\n[305 \nU.S. 255, 261]\n\u00a0\n that the possible penalty, in case of a prosecution under Section 13, is so serious as to prevent the opportunity to defend from being an adequate remedy. Compare Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123, 165\n, 28 S.Ct. 441, 456, 13 L.R.A.,N.S., 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764. No prosecution has been instituted or threatened. And authority to institute such a proceeding rests not with the Railroad Retirement Board, but with the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California, who is not made defendant in this suit. \n8\n Furthermore, it may be doubted whether a refusal to comply with the regulation would be deemed willful, if based on an honest belief that the Act is not applicable to a railroad operated by the State. Compare United States v. Murdock, \n290 \nU.S. 389\n, 394-396, 54 S.Ct. 223, 225, 226.\n Second. The alleged threat of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to require payment of the tax does not show danger of irreparable injury. The only threat alleged is the ruling that the Carriers Taxing Act is applicable to this railroad-a ruling made in answer to an inquiry by the Attorney General of the State. The tax for the year is $7,862.32 payable by the State Belt Railroad; and an equal amount payable by the employees to be deducted by it from their compensation. Payment of the tax would not expose the State to irreparable injury,9 since the amount paid with interest could be recovered if not due. Payment followed by proceedings to recover the amount would involve some delay, as an action at law to recover the sum paid could not be instituted until six months after making the claim for refund, if the Commissioner should fail to act earlier upon it. \n10\n Such possible delay, it is urged, is a special circumstance which justifies resort to a suit for an injunction in order that the ques- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 255, 262]\n\u00a0\n tion of liability may be promptly determined. If the delay incident to such proceedings justified refusal to pay a tax, the federal rule that a suit in equity will not lie to restrain collection on the sole ground that the tax is illegal,11 could have little application. For possible delay of that character is the common incident of practically every contest over the validity of a federal tax.\n It is urged that in order to raise the money with which to pay the State's portion of the tax, it would be necessary to readjust the tariffs of State Belt Railroad; and that the deduction of the employees' portion from the payroll would result in a multiplicity of suits by employees to recover the amounts and to reestablish their rights and privileges under the laws of the State. The meagre statements of the bill do not convince us that the apprehension alleged is well founded. The State Employees Retirement Act also requires the State Belt Railroad to make deductions from the salaries of its employees. The bill does not show the precise relationship between the amounts required to be deducted by the state and federal acts, or even, if the amount of the federal deduction is greater, that it is impossible for the State Belt Railroad to work out with its employees a way of adjusting its affairs during the period of uncertainty as to which act is applicable. Mere inconvenience to the taxpayer in raising the money with which to pay taxes is not uncommon, and is not a special circumstance which entitles one to resort to a suit for an injunction in order to test the validity or applicability of the tax. For aught that appears prompt payment of the tax and claim of refund would have led to an early determination of the liability here contested.\n Bill dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of August 29, 1935, c. 812, 49 Stat. 967, as amended June 24, 1937, c. 382, Part 1, 50 Stat. 307, 45 U.S.C.  228a-228r (1937 Supp.), 45 U.S.C.A.  228a-228r. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of June 29, 1937, c. 405, 50 Stat. 435, 45 U.S.C.  261-273 ( 1937 Supp.), 45 U.S.C.A.  261-273. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] This objection was the basis of two of the reasons given in support of the motion to dismiss. The other seven are: (1) The individual citizenship of defendants can form no basis for the original jurisdiction of the Court. The defendant can and will act only as officials of the United States; and as officials they are citizens of no state. (2) The Collector of Internal Revenue for the First District of California and the employees of the State Belt Railroad have not been joined as defendants. They are indispensable parties in whose absence the Court should not proceed. (3) The cause is not maintainable in this Court, since the Collector of Internal Revenue for the First District of California, a citizen of California, should be made a party, and to join him would deprive the Court of original jurisdiction. (4) The cause is not maintainable in this Court, since the employees of the State Belt Railroad, citizens of California, should be made parties, and to join any of them would deprive the Court of original jurisdiction. (5) Maintenance of the suit is prohibited by Section 3224 of the Revised Statutes, 26 U.S.C.A.  1543. (6) The United States is the real party in interest and hence an indispensable party.

O'Mara, both of Terre Haute, Ind ., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Raymond Brooks, of North Manchester, Ind., and Asa J. Smith, of Indianapolis, Ind., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner sought a writ of mandate to compel the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 97]\n\u00a0\n respondent1 to continue her in employment as a public school teacher. Her complaint alleged that as a duly licensed teacher she entered into a contract in September, 1924, to teach in the township schools and, pursuant to successive contracts, taught continuously to and including the school year 1932-1933; that her contracts for the school years 1931-1932 and 1932-1933 contained this clause: 'It is further agreed by the contracting parties that all of the provisions of the Teachers' Tenure Law, approved March 8, 1927, shall be in full force and effect in this contract'; and that by force of that act she had a contract, indefinite in duration, which could be canceled by the respondent only in the manner and for the causes specified in the act. She charged that in July, 1933, the respondent notified her he proposed to cancel her contract for cause; that, after a hearing, he adhered to his decision and the county superintendent affirmed his action; that, despite what occurred in July, 1933, the petitioner was permitted to teach during the school year 1933-1934 and the respondent was presently threatening to terminate her employment at the end of that year. The complaint alleged the termination of her employment would be a breach of her contract with the school corporation. The respondent demurred on the grounds that (1) the complaint disclosed the matters pleaded had been submitted to the respondent and the county superintendent who were authorized to try the issues and had lawfully determined them in favor of the respondent; and (2) the Teachers' Tenure Law, Acts Ind. 1927, c. 97, had been repealed in respect of teachers in township schools. The demurrer was sustained and the petitioner appealed to the state \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 98]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court which affirmed the judgment. \n2\n The Court did not discuss the first ground of demurrer relating to the action taken in the school year 1932-1933, but rested its decision upon the second, that, by an act of 1933, Acts Ind.1933, c. 116, the Teachers' Tenure Law had been repealed as respects teachers in township schools; and held that the repeal did not deprive the petitioner of a vested property right and did not impair her contract within the meaning of the Constitution. In its original opinion the court said: 'The relatrix contends ... that, having become a permanent teacher under the Teachers' Tenure Law before the amendment, she had a vested property right in her indefinite contract, which may not be impaired under the Constitution. The question is whether there is a vested right in a permanent teacher's contract; whether, under the tenure law, there is a grant which cannot lawfully be impaired by a repeal of the statute.' Where the state court does not decide against a petitioner or appellant upon an independent state ground, but deeming the federal question to be before it, actually entertains and decides that question adversely to the federal right asserted, this Court has jurisdiction to review the judgment if, as here, it is a final judgment. 3 We cannot refuse jurisdiction because the state court might have based its decision, consistently with the record, upon an independent and adequate nonfederal ground. And since the amendment of the judiciary act of 17894 by the act of February 5, 18675 it has always been held this Court may examine the opinion of the state court to ascertain whether a fed- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 99]\n\u00a0\n eral question was raised and decided, and whether the court rested its judgment on an adequate nonfederal ground. \n6\n Any ambiguity arising from the generality of the court's reference to the Constitution is resolved by a certificate signed by all the Justices of the court, made a part of the record, to the effect that the reference to the Constitution in the opinion was to article 1, section 10, of the Constitution of the United States. \n7\n It thus appearing that the constitutional validity of the repealing act was drawn in question and the statute sustained, we issued the writ of certiorari. \n302 \nU.S. 678\n, 58 S.Ct. 262, 82 L.Ed. --.\n The court below holds that in Indiana teachers' contracts are made for but 1 year; that there is no contractual right to be continued as a teacher from year to year; that the law grants a privilege to one who has taught 5 years and signed a new contract to continue in employment under given conditions; that the statute is directed merely to the exercise of their powers by the school authorities and the policy therein expressed may be altered at the will of the Legislature; that in enacting laws for the government of public schools, the Legislature exercises a function of sovereignty and the power to control public policy in respect of their management and operation cannot be contracted away by one Legislature so as to create a permanent public policy unchangeable by succeeding Legislatures. In the alternative the court declares that if the relationship be considered as controlled by the rules of private contract the provision for re-em- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 100]\n\u00a0\n ployment from year to year is unenforceable for want of mutuality.\n As in most cases brought to this court under the contract clause of the Constitution, the question is as to the existence and nature of the contract and not as to the construction of the law which is supposed to impair it. The principal function of a legislative body is not to make contracts but to make laws which declare the policy of the state and are subject to repeal when a subsequent Legislature shall determine to alter that policy. Nevertheless, it is established that a legislative enactment may contain provisions which, when accepted as the basis of action by individuals, become contracts between them and the State or its subdivisions within the protection of article 1,  10. 8 If the people's representatives deem it in the public interest they may adopt a policy of contracting in respect of public business for a term longer than the life of the current session of the Legislature. This the petitioner claims has been done with respect to permanent teachers. The Supreme Court has decided, however, that it is the state's policy not to bind school corporations by contract for more than 1 year.\n On such a question, one primarily of state law, we accord respectful consideration and great weight to the views of the state's highest court but, in order that the constitutional mandate may not become a dead letter, we are bound to decide for ourselves whether a contract was made, what are its terms and conditions, and whether the State has, by later legislation, impaired its obligation. \n9\n This involves an appraisal of the statutes of the State and the decisions of its courts.\n The courts of Indiana have long recognized that the employment of school teachers was contractual and have \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 101]\n\u00a0\n afforded relief in actions upon teachers' contracts. \n10\n An act adopted in 189911 required all contracts between teachers and school corporations to be in writing, signed by the parties to be charged, and to be made a matter of public record. A statute of 192112 enacted that every such contract should be in writing and should state the date of the beginning of the school term, the number of months therein, the amount of the salary for the term, and the number of payments to be made during the school year.\n In 1927 the State adopted the Teachers' Tenure Act13 under which the present controversy arises. The pertinent portions are copied in the margin. 14 By this act it was provided that a teacher who has served under con- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 102]\n\u00a0\n tract for 5 or more successive years, and thereafter enters into a contract for further service with the school corporation, shall become a permanent teacher and the contract, upon the expiration of its stated term, shall be deemed to continue in effect for an indefinite period, shall be known as an indefinite contract, and shall remain in force unless succeeded by a new contract or canceled as provided in the act. The corporation may cancel the \n___ 'Sec. 2. Any indefinite contract with a permanent teacher as defined in section 1 of this act may be cancelled only in the following manner: Not less than thirty days nor more than forty days before the consideration by any school corporation of the cancellation of any such contract, such teacher shall be notified in writing of the exact date, time when and place where such consideration is to take place; and such teacher shall be furnished a written statement of the reasons for such consideration, within five days after any written request for such statement; and such teacher shall, upon written request for a hearing, filed within fifteen days after the receipt by said teacher of notice of date, time and place of such consideration, be given such a hearing before the school board, in the case of cities and towns, and before the township trustee, in the case of townships; such hearing shall be held not less than five days after such request is filed and such teacher shall be given not less than five days' notice of the time and place of such hearing. Such teacher, at the hearing, shall have a right to a full statement of the reasons for the proposed cancellation of such contract, and shall have a right to be heard, to present the testimony of witnesses and other evidence bearing upon the reasons for the proposed cancellation of such contract. No such contract shall be cancelled until the date set for consideration of the cancellation of such contract; nor until after a hearing is held, if such hearing is requested by said teacher; nor until, in the case of teachers, supervisors, and principals, the city or town superintendents, in cities and towns, and the county superintendents, in townships and in cities and towns not having superintendents, shall have given the school corporation his recommendations thereon, and it shall be the duty of such superintendent to present such recommendations upon five days' written notice to him by such school corporation. ... Cancellation of an indefinite contract of a permanent teacher may be made for incompetency, insubordination (which shall be deemed to mean a wilful refusal to obey the school laws of this state or reasonable rules prescribed for the government of the public schools of such corporation), neglect of duty, immorality, justifiable decrease in the number of teaching positions or other good and just cause, but may not be made for political or personal reasons. * * \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 103]\n\u00a0\n contract, after notice and hearing, for incompetency, insubordination, neglect of duty, immorality, justifiable decrease in the number of teaching positions, or other good or just cause, but not for political or personal reasons. The teacher may not cancel the contract during the school term nor for a period 30 days previous to the beginning of any term ( unless by mutual agreement) and may cancel only upon 5 days' notice.\n___ 'Sec. 4. No permanent teacher shall be permitted to cancel his indefinite contract during the school term for which his said contract is in effect nor for a period of thirty (30) days previous to the beginning of such school term unless such cancellation is mutually agreed upon; such permanent teacher shall be permitted to cancel his indefinite contract at any other time by giving a five days' notice to the school corporation. Any permanent teacher cancelling his indefinite contract in any other manner than in this section provided shall be deemed guilty of unprofessional conduct and the state superintendent is hereby authorized to suspend the license of such teacher for a period of not exceeding one year. ...\n'Sec. 6. This act shall be construed as supplementary to an act of the general assembly, page 195, acts 1921, entitled 'An act concerning teachers' contracts and providing for the repeal of conflicting laws.\" \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 104]\n\u00a0\n By an amendatory act of 193315 township school corporations were omitted from the provisions of the act of 1927. The court below construed this act as repealing the act of 1927 so far as township schools and teachers are concerned and as leaving the respondent free to terminate the petitioner's employment. But we are of opinion that the petitioner had a valid contract with the respondent, the obligation of which would be impaired by the termination of her employment.\n\n Where the claim is that the state's policy embodied in a statute is to bind its instrumentalities by contract, the cardinal inquiry is as to the terms of the statute supposed to create such a contract. The State long prior to the adoption of the act of 1927 required the execution of written contracts between teachers and school corporations, specified certain subjects with which such contracts must deal, and required that they be made a matter of public record. These were annual contracts, covering a single school term. The act of 1927 announced a new policy that a teacher who had served for 5 years under successive contracts, upon the execution of another was to become a permanent teacher and the last contract was to be indefinite as to duration and terminable by either party only upon compliance with the conditions set out in the statute. The policy which induced the legislation evidently was that the teacher should have protection against the exercise of the right, which would otherwise inhere in the employer, of terminating the employment at the end of any school term without assigned reasons and solely at the employer's pleasure. The state courts in earlier cases so declared. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 105]\n\u00a0\n The title of the act is couched in terms of contract. It speaks of the making and canceling of indefinite contracts. In the body the word 'contract' appears ten times in section 1, defining the relationship; eleven times in section 2, relating to the termination of the employment by the employer, and four times in section 4, stating the conditions of termination by the teacher.\n The tenor of the act indicates that the word 'contract' was not used inadvertently or in other than its usual legal meaning. By section 6 it is expressly provided that the act is a supplement to that of March 7, 1921, supra, requiring teachers' employment contracts to be in writing. By section 1 it is provided that the written contract of a permanent teacher 'shall be deemed to continue in effect for an indefinite period and shall be known as an indefinite contract.' Such an indefinite contract is to remain in force unless succeeded by a new contract signed by both parties or canceled as provided in section 2. No more apt language could be employed to define a contractual relationship. By section 2 it is enacted that such indefinite contracts may be canceled by the school corporation only in the manner specified. The admissible grounds of cancellation, and the method by which the existence of such grounds shall be ascertained and made a matter of record, are carefully set out. Section 4 permits cancellation by the teacher only at certain times consistent with the convenient administration of the school system and imposes a sanction for violation of its requirements. Examination of the entire act convinces us that the teacher was by it assured of the possession of a binding and enforceable contract against school districts.\n Until its decision in the present case the Supreme Court of the State had uniformly held that the teacher's right to continued employment by virtue of the indefinite contract created pursuant to the act was contractual.\n In School City of Elwood v. State ex rel. Griffin et al., 203 Ind. 626, at page 634, 180 N.E. 471, 474, 81 A.L.R. 1027, it was said: \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 106]\n\u00a0\n 'The position of a teacher in the public schools is not a public office, but an employment by contract between the teacher and the school corporation. The relation remains contractual after the teacher has, under the provisions of a Teachers' Tenure Law, become a permanent teacher-but the terms and conditions of the contract are thereafter governed primarily by the statute.'\n In Kostanzer v. State, 205 Ind. 536, at page 547, 187 N.E. 337, 341, an action in mandate to compel reinstatement of a discharged teacher, it was said: 'If appellee's position is not an office, appellants insist that mandamus is not available for the reason that the granting of mandatory relief results in enforcing a purely contractual right. It is true that mandatory relief against appellants will result in enforcing appellee's rights under her contract; but the duty which the judgment of the trial court compelled appellants to perform was a duty enjoined by statute and not by contract. The contract between appellants and appellee created a relation which entitled appellee to have appellants perform the duty in question; but the duty was not imposed by any provision of the contract.'\n And in the same case it was also said (205 Ind. 536, at pages 548, 549, 187 N.E. 337, 342): 'The Tenure Act permits a teacher to cancel his contract at any time after the close of a school term up to thirty days prior to the begining of the next school term, provided five days' notice is given, and appellant contends that there was no contract between appellee and appellants for the reason 'that a contract which does not bind both parties binds neither of them.' This proposition is undoubtedly supported by the law of contracts. But there is nothing in the law of contracts to prevent one party to a contract granting to the other the privilege of rescission or cancellation on terms not reserved to the former party. The local school corporations are agents of the state in the administration of the public schools and the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 107]\n\u00a0\n General Assembly has the power to prescribe the terms of the contract to be executed by these agents.'\n In State v. Board of School Commissioners of Indianapolis, 205 Ind. 582, 187 N.E. 392, an action in mandate to compel reinstatement of a discharged teacher, the court referred to the indefinite contract of a permanent teacher and held that it remained in full force and effect until succeeded by a new contract or canceled as provided in section 2 of the act.\n In Arburn v. Hunt, 207 Ind. 61, 191 N.E. 148, 149, it is said: 'The source of authority for the so-called permanent teacher's contract is the statute. The Legislature need not have provided for such contracts, but, since it did so provide, the entire statute, with all of its provisions, must be read into and considered as a part of the contract.'\n We think the decision in this case runs counter to the policy evinced by the act of 1927, to its explicit mandate and to earlier decisions construing its provisions. Also that the decision in Phelps v. Board of Education, \n300 \nU.S. 319\n, 57 S.Ct. 483, that the act there considered did not create a contract, is not, as the court below suggests, authority for a like result here. Dodge v. Board of Education, \n302 \nU.S. 74\n, 58 S.Ct. 98, on which the respondent relies, is distinguishable, because the statute there involved did not purport to bind the respondent by contract to the payment of retirement annuities, and similar legislation in respect of other municipal employees had been consistently construed by the courts as not creating contracts.\n The respondent urges that every contract is subject to the police power and that in repealing the Teachers' Tenure Act the Legislature validly exercised that reserved power of the State. The sufficient answer is found in the statute. By section 2 of the act of 1927 power is given to the school corporation to cancel a teacher's indefinite contract for incompetency, insubordination (which is to be deemed to mean willful refusal to obey the school laws of the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 108]\n\u00a0\n State or reasonable rules prescribed by the employer), neglect of duty, immorality, justifiable decrease in the number of teaching positions, or other good and just cause. The permissible reasons for cancellation cover every conceivable basis for such action growing out of a deficient performance of the obligations undertaken by the teacher, and diminution of the school requirements. Although the causes specified constitute in themselves just and reasonable grounds for the termination of any ordinary contract of employment, to preclude the assumption that any other valid ground was excluded by the enumeration, the Legislature added that the relation might be terminated for any other good and just cause. Thus in the declaration of the state's policy, ample reservations in aid of the efficient administration of the school system were made. The express prohibitions are that the contract shall not be canceled for political or personal reasons. We do not think the asserted change of policy evidenced by the repeal of the statute is that school boards may be at liberty to cancel a teacher's contract for political or personal reasons. We do not understand the respondent so to contend. The most that can be said for his position is that, by the repeal, township school corporations were again put upon the basis of annual contracts, renewable at the pleasure of the board. It is significant that the act of 1933 left the system of permanent teachers and indefinite contracts untouched as respects school corporations in cities and towns of the State. It is not contended, nor can it be thought, that the Legislature of 1933 determined that it was against public policy for school districts in cities and towns to terminate the employment of teachers of 5 or more years' experience for political or personal reasons and to permit cancellation, for the same reasons, in townships.\n Our decisions recognize that every contract is made subject to the implied condition that its fulfillment may \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 109]\n\u00a0\n be frustrated by a proper exercise of the police power but we have repeatedly said that, in order to have this effect, the exercise of the power must be for an end which is in fact public and the means adopted must be reasonably adapted to that end,17 and the Supreme Court of Indiana has taken the same view in respect of legislation impairing the obligation of the contract of a state instrumentality. \n18\n The causes of cancellation provided in the act of 1927 and the retention of the system of indefinite contracts in all municipalities except townships by the act of 1933 are persuasive that the repeal of the earlier act by the later was not an exercise of the police power for the attainment of ends to which its exercise may properly be directed.\n As the court below has not passed upon one of the grounds of demurrer which appears to involve no federal question, and may present a defense still open to the respondent, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n So ordered.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n In my opinion this reversal unconstitutionally limits the right of Indiana to control Indiana's public school system. I believe the judgment should be affirmed because: \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 110]\n\u00a0\n (1) It does not appear in the record that a federal question was necessarily involved in the decision of the state court;1 (2) the record does not disclose beyond a reasonable doubt2 that Indiana, by the Teachers Act of 1927, c. 97, surrendered its sovereign, governmental right to change and alter at will legislative policy related to the public welfare, or that its Legislature had the power to do so.\n First. It does not appear from the record that a federal question 'was necessarily involved in the decision; and that the State court could not have given the judgment or decree, which they passed, without deciding it.' \n3\n Therefore, 'it is a matter of no consequence to us that the court may have gone further and decided a Federal question.' \n4\n 'Where a case in this court can be decided without reference to questions arising under the Federal Constitution, that course is usually pursued and is not departed from without important reasons.' \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioner's complaint disclosed: That, after a hearing, she was removed from her position as a teacher for causes including those set out in the statute, i.e., (1) 'neglect of duty' and (2) 'for other good and just cause'; and that the county superintendent, on appeal, approved her removal. A demurrer was sustained to the complaint. The demurrer assigned the general ground that the complaint failed to 'state facts sufficient to constitute a good cause of action.' One of the specific reasons set out for demurrer was that the complaint showed on its face that petitioner had been removed only after a proper notice and hearings before the township trustee and the county superintendent, in accordance with the requirements of the act. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 111]\n\u00a0\n Under these circumstances, we can consider the decision of the Indiana courts as based on a finding of inadequacy in petitioner's complaint under Indiana law. This Court does not decide 'questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case.' \n6\n We should not depart from this policy in order to strike down a law passed by a State in its sovereign capacity to establish legislative policies for the education of its people.\n Second. This Court has declared that 'neither the (Fourteenth) amendment ... nor any other amendment, was designed to interfere with the power of the state, sometimes termed its police power, to prescribe regulations to promote ... education ... of the people.' \n7\n Article 8, section 1, of the Constitution of Indiana provides: 'knowledge and learning, generally diffused throughout a community, being essential to the preservation of a free government; it shall be the duty of the General Assembly ... to provide, by law, for a general and uniform system of Common Schools, wherein tuition shall be without charge, and equally open to all.' In carrying out this constitutional mandate to provide education for the people of the State, the Legislature of Indiana has found it necessary-as have other States-to alter legislative policy from time to time. The statutes and the decisions of Indiana indicate a laudible desire and a commendable effort not only to provide sufficient funds to \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 112]\n\u00a0\n carry out these educational aspirations of the State, but also to provide reasonable security of employment for teachers. Such effort brought about the 'Indiana Teachers Tenure Act of 1927.' This law provided the conditions upon which 'permanent' teachers with 'indefinite contracts' could be removed from their positions, and was evidently intended to provide statutory security against their discharge by local school authorities for any causes except those specified in the law. These 'permanent' teachers could cancel their 'indefinite contracts' upon 5 days' notice at any time except during the school term or for a period of 30 days previous to it.\n In 1933, the legislative representatives of the people of Indiana decided to change this policy by excluding township school corporations from its operation. The contention here is that the statutory tenure given teachers under the 1927 act amounted to contracts with the State which could not be impaired by repeal or modification of the law.\n The Indiana Supreme Court has consistently held, even before its decision in this case, that the right of teacher, under the 1927 act, to serve until removed for cause, was not given by contract, but by statute. Such was the express holding in the two cases cited in the majority opinion: Kostanzer v. State, 205 Ind. 536, 187 N.E. 337, 341; and School City of Elwood v. State, 203 Ind. 626, 180 N.E. 471, 81 A.L.R. 1027\n\n\n In Kostanzer v. State, supra, a teacher filed petition for mandamus alleging removal contrary to the 'indefinite contract' obligation under the act of 1927. Mandamus was opposed as an improper remedy because the teachers sought to compel action under a teachers' tenure 'contract.' Denying the contention that the teacher's rights were fixed by contract, the Supreme Court of Indiana said: 'But the duty which the judgment of the trial court compelled appellants to perform was a duty enjoined by \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 113]\n\u00a0\n statute and not by contract. ... The duty was not imposed by any provision of the contract. In School City of Elwood v. State ex rel. Griffin, supra, this same contention was disposed of in the following language: 'It is because of appellees' rights under this statute ... that mandamus is the proper remedy in this case. ... a public school teacher who, under a positive provision of the statute, has a fixed tenure of employment or can be removed only in a certain manner prescribed by the statute, is entitled to reinstatement if he has been removed from his position in violation of his statutory rights.'\n These cases demonstrate that the Supreme Court of Indiana has uniformly held that teachers did not hold their 'indefinite' tenure under contract, but by grant of a repealable statute. In order to hold in this case that a contract was impaired, it is necessary to create a contract unauthorized by the Indiana Legislature and declared to be nonexistent by the Indiana Supreme Court.\n In the similar case of Phelps v. Board of Education, \n300 \nU.S. 319, 323\n, 57 S.Ct. 483, coming to this Court from New Jersey, the Supreme Court of that State declared that: 'The status of tenure teachers, while in one sense perhaps contractual, is in essence dependent on a statute, ... which the Legislature at will may abolish, or whose emoluments it may change.'\n Under the New Jersey act, which appears in the margin,8 teachers could serve during 'good behavior and \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 114]\n\u00a0\n efficiency' and subject to removal only after a hearing and for cause. The Supreme Court of New Jersey declared that the tenure of New Jersey teachers was 'in one sense perhaps contractual.' The Supreme Court of Indiana declared that the tenure of Indiana teachers was not contractual. Yet this Court in the case of Phelps v. Board of Education, supra, decided that New Jersey's discharge of its teachers employed by the State 'in one sense perhaps contractual' did not impair their contracts. The Court now strikes down Indiana's Teachers Tenure Law after repeated decisions by the state's Supreme Court that the teachers' tenure is not contractual. The intent of the New Jersey act and the intent of the Indiana act were evidently identical and, in view of this fact, I believe that the decision on the New Jersey appeal and the majority decision on the Indiana appeal are irreconcilable.\n The act of 1927 certainly does not clearly establish that the people of Indiana intended to surrender their sovereign right to change their educational policies from time to time to meet new needs or changed conditions. Under these circumstances 'The presumption is that such a law ( Teachers Tenure Law) is not intended to create private contractual or vested rights, but merely declares a policy to be pursued until the Legislature shall ordain otherwise.' \n 9\n\u00a0\n\n It is the end of every government to promote the general welfare of its people and we do not assume 'that the government intended to diminish its power of accomplishing the end for which it was created.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The Supreme Court of Indiana here held that 'the tenure Law does not purport to give a teacher a definite \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 115]\n\u00a0\n and permanent contract. The word 'indefinite' is used in the statute itself. ... The tenure statute was only intended as a limitation upon the plenary power of local school officials to cancel contracts. ... It was not intended as, and cannot be, a limitation upon the power of future Legislatures to change the law respecting teachers and their tenures. These are matters of public policy, of purely governmental concern, in which the legislative power cannot be exhausted or consumed, or contracted away, so as to limit the discretion of future General Assemblies.' \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Prior to this decision and even before the 1927 act, the Supreme Court of Indiana had said: 'With that (legislative) determination ( relating to educational matters) the judiciary can no more rightfully interfere than can the legislature with a decree or judgment pronounced by a judicial tribunal. ... As the power over schools is a legislative one, is is not exhausted by exercise. The legislature, having tried one plan, is not precluded from trying another. It has a choice of methods, and may change its plans as often as it deems necessary or expedient; and for mistakes or abuses it is answerable to the people, but not to the courts.' \n 12\n\u00a0\n\n The clear purport of Indiana law is that its Legislature cannot surrender any part of its plenary constitutional right to repeal, alter or amend existing legislation relating to the school system whenever the conditions demand change for the public good. Under Indiana law the Legislature can neither barter nor give away its constitutional investiture of power. It can make no contract in conflict with this sovereign power. The construction of the constitution of Indiana by the Supreme Court of Indiana must be accepted as correct. That court holds that Indi- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 116]\n\u00a0\n ana's Constitution invests Indiana's Legislature with continuing power to change Indiana's educational policies. It has here held that the Legislature did not attempt or intend to surrender its constitutional power by authorizing definite contracts which would prevent the future exercise of this continuing, constitutional power. If the Constitution and statutes of Indiana, as construed by its Supreme Court, prohibit the Legislature from making a contract which is inconsistent with a continuing power to legislate, there could have been no definite contracts to be impaired. 'The contracts designed to be protected by the (Federal Constitution) are contracts by which perfect rights, certain definite, fixed private rights of property, are vested. ... It follows, then, upon principle that, in every perfect or competent government, there must exist a general power to enact and to repeal laws; and to create, and change or discontinue, the agents designated for the execution of those laws.' \n13\n\u00a0\n\n Merits of a policy establishing a permanent, teacher tenure law are not for consideration here. We are dealing with the constitutional right of the people of a sovereign state to control their own public school system as they deem best for the public welfare. This Court should neither make it impossible for states to experiment in the matter of security of tenure for their teachers, nor deprive them of the right to change a policy if it is found that it has not operated successfully.\n The Indiana Constitution gives the state Legislature complete authority to control the public school system. The state Supreme Court declares that under this authority the Legislature can change school plans as often as it believes a change will promote the interest of education 'and for mistakes or abuses it is answerable to the people, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 95, 117]\n\u00a0\n but not to the courts.' \n14\n I believe the people of Indiana, if they prefer, have the right under the Federal Constitution to entrust this important public policy to the elective representatives rather than to the courts. Democracy permits the people to rule. I cannot agree that the constitutional prohibition against impairment of contracts was intended to- or does-transfer in part the determination of the educational policy of Indiana from the Legislature of that State to this Court.\n Indiana, in harmony with our national tradition, seeks to work out a school system, offering education to all, as 'essential to the preservation of free government.' That great function of an advancing society has heretofore been exercised by the States. I find no constitutional authority for this Court to appropriate that power. Indiana's highest court has said that the State did not, and has strongly indicated that the Legislature could not, make contracts with a few citizens, that would take away from all the citizens, the continuing power to alter the educational policy for the best interests of Indiana school children. The majority decision now places in this Court a power which has been exercised by the states since the adoption of our Constitution. The people have not surrendered that power to this Court by constitutional amendment.\n For these reasons I cannot agree to the majority decision and I believe the judgment of the Supreme Court of Indiana should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n303 \nU.S. 667\n, 58 S.Ct. 641, 82 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The proceeding was instituted against the respondent's predecessor who then held the office of school trustee; the respondent was subsequently substituted as defendant.

Williams, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 337, 342]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the court.\n Petitioner Lloyd Gaines, a negro, was refused admission to the School of Law of the State University of Missouri. Asserting that this refusal constituted a denial by the State of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, U.S.C.A. Const. Amend. 14, petitioner brought this action for mandamus to compel the curators of the University to admit him. On final hearing, an alternative writ was quashed and a peremptory writ was denied by the Circuit Court. The Supreme Court of the State affirmed the judgment. 113 S. W.2d 783. We granted certiorari. \n305 \nU.S. 580\n, 59 S.Ct. 65, 83 L.Ed. --.\n Petitioner is a citizen of Missouri. In August , 1935, he was graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Arts at the Lincoln University, an institution maintained by the State of Missouri for the higher education of negroes. That University has no law school. Upon the filing of his application for admission to the law school of the University of Missouri, the registrar advised him to communicate with the president of Lincoln University and the latter directed petitioner's attention to Section 9622 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri (1929), Mo.St.Ann.  9622, p. 7328, providing as follows:\n's 9622. May arrange for attendance at university of any adjacent state-tuition fees. Pending the full development of the Lincoln university, the board of \n\n[305 \nU.S. 337, 343]\n\u00a0\n curators shall have the authority to arrange for the attendance of negro residents of the state of Missouri at the unversity of any adjacent state to take any course or to study any subjects provided for at the state university of Missouri, and which are not taught at the Lincoln university and to pay the reasonable tuition fees for such attendance; provided that whenever the board of curators deem it advisable they shall have the power to open any necessary school or department. (Laws 1921, p. 86,  7.)'\n\n Petitioner was advised to apply to the State Superintendent of Schools for aid under that statute. It was admitted on the trial that petitioner's 'work and credits at the Lincoln University would qualify him for admission to the School of Law of the University of Missouri if he were found otherwise eligible'. He was refused admission upon the ground that it was 'contrary to the constitution, laws and public policy of the State to admit a negro as a student in the University of Missouri'. It appears that there are schools of law in connection with the state universities of four adjacent States, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois, where non-resident negroes are admitted.\n The clear and definite conclusions of the state court in construing the pertinent state legislation narrow the issue. The action of the curators, who are representatives of the State in the management of the state university (R.S.Mo. Sec. 9625, Mo.St.Ann.  9625, p. 7330), must be regarded as state action. \n1\n The state constitution provides that separate free public schools shall be established for the education of children of African descent (Art. 11, Sec. 3), Mo.St.Ann. Const. art. 11,  3, and by statute separate high school facilities are supplied for colored students equal to those provided for white students (R.S.Mo. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 337, 344]\n\u00a0\n Secs. 9346-9349, Mo.St.Ann.  9346-9349, pp. 7183-7187). While there is no express constitutional provision requiring that the white and negro races be separated for the purpose of higher education, the state court on a comprehensive review of the state statutes held that it was intended to separate the white and negro races for that purpose also. Referring in particular to Lincoln University, the court deemed it to be clear 'that the Legislature intended to bring the Lincoln University up to the standard of the University of Missouri, and give to the whites and negroes an equal opportunity for higher education-the whites at the University of Missouri, and the negroes at Lincoln University'. 113 S.W.2d 787. Further, the court concluded that the provisions of Section 9622 (above quoted) to the effect that negro residents 'may attend the university of any adjacent State with their tuition paid, pending the full development of Lincoln University', made it evident 'that the Legislature did not intend that negroes and whites should attend the same university in this State'. In that view it necessarily followed that the curators of the University of Missouri acted in accordance with the policy of the State in denying petitioner admission to its School of Law upon the sole ground of his race.\n In answering petitioner's contention that this discrimination constituted a denial of his constitutional right, the state court has fully recognized the obligation of the State to provide negroes with advantages for higher education substantially equal to the advantages afforded to white students. The State has sought to fulfill that obligation by furnishing equal facilities in separate schools, a method the validity of which has been sustained by our decisions. Plessy v. Ferguson, \n163 \nU.S. 537, 544\n, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 1140; McCabe v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe. Rwy. Co., \n235 \nU.S. 151, 160\n, 35 S.Ct. 69, 70; Gong Lum v. Rice, \n275 \nU.S. 78, 85\n, 86 S., 48 S.Ct. 91, 93. Compare Cumming v. Board of Education, \n175 \nU.S. 528, 544\n, 545 S., 20 S.Ct. 197, 200. Respondents' counsel have appropriately emphasized the special \n\n[305 \nU.S. 337, 345]\n\u00a0\n solicitude of the State for the higher education of negroes as shown in the establishment of Lincoln University, a state institution well conducted on a plane with the University of Missouri so far as the offered courses are concerned. It is said that Missouri is a pioneer in that field and is the only State in the Union which has established a separate university for negroes on the same basis as the state university for white students. But, commendable as is that action, the fact remains that instruction in law for negroes is not now afforded by the State, either at Lincoln University or elsewhere within the State, and that the State excludes negroes from the advantages of the law school it has established at the University of Missouri.\n It is manifest that this discrimination, if not relieved by the provisions we shall presently discuss, would constitute a denial of equal protection. That was the conclusion of the Court of Appeals of Maryland in circumstances substantially similar in that aspect. University of Maryland v. Murray, 169 Md. 478, 182 A. 590, 103 A.L.R. 706. It there appeared that the State of Maryland had 'undertaken the function of education in the law' but had 'omitted students of one race from the only adequate provision made for it, and omitted them solely because of their color'; that if those students were to be offered 'equal treatment in the performance of the function, they must, at present, be admitted to the one school provided'. Id., page 489, 182 A. page 594. A provision for scholarships to enable negroes to attend colleges outside the State, mainly for the purpose of professional studies, was found to be inadequate ( Id., pages 485, 486, 182 A. page 593) and the question, 'whether with aid in any amount it is sufficient to send the negroes outside the State for legal education', the Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to discuss. Accordingly, a writ of mandamus to admit the applicant was issued to the officers and \n\n[305 \nU.S. 337, 346]\n\u00a0\n regents of the University of Maryland as the agents of the State entrusted with the conduct of that institution.\n The Supreme Court of Missouri in the instant case has distinguished the decision in Maryland upon the grounds-(1) that in Missouri, but not in Maryland, there is 'a legislative declaration of a purpose to establish a law school for negroes at Lincoln University whenever necessary or practical'; and (2) that, 'pending the establishment of such a school, adequate provision has been made for the legal education of negro students in recognized schools outside of this State'. 113 S.W.2d page 791.\n As to the first ground, it appears that the policy of establishing a law school at Lincoln University has not yet ripened into an actual establishment, and it cannot be said that a mere declaration of purpose, still unfulfilled, is enough. The provision for legal education at Lincoln is at present entirely lacking. Respondents' counsel urge that if, on the date when petitioner applied for admission to the University of Missouri, he had instead applied to the curators of Lincoln University it would have been their duty to establish a law school; that this 'agency of the State,' to which he should have applied, was 'specifically charged with the mandatory duty to furnish him what he seeks.' We do not read the opinion of the Supreme Court as construing the state statute to impose such a 'mandatory duty' as the argument seems to assert. The state court quoted the language of Section 9618, R.S.Mo.1929, Mo.St.Ann.  9618, p. 7327, set forth in the margin,2 making it the mandatory \n\n[305 \nU.S. 337, 347]\n\u00a0\n duty of the board of curators to establish a law school in Lincoln University 'whenever necessary and practicable in their opinion'. This qualification of their duty, explicitly stated in the statute, manifestly leaves it to the judgment of the curators to decide when it will be necessary and practicable to establish a law school, and the state court so construed the statute. Emphasizing the discretion of the curators, the court said:\n'The statute was enacted in 1921. Since its enactment no negro, not even appellant, has applied to Lincoln University for a law education. This fact demonstrates the wisdom of the Legislature in leaving it to the judgment of the board of curators to determine when it would be necessary or practicable to establish a law school for negroes at Lincoln University. Pending that time, adequate provision is made for the legal education of negroes in the university of some adjacent State, as heretofore pointed out'. 113 S.W.2d page 791.\n\n The state court has not held that it would have been the duty of the curators to establish a law school at Lincoln University for the petitioner on his application. Their duty, as the court defined it, would have been either to supply a law school at Lincoln University as provided in Section 9618 or to furnish him the opportunity to obtain his legal training in another State as provided in Section 9622. Thus the law left the curators free to adopt the latter course. The state court has not ruled or intimated that their failure or refusal to establish a law school for a very few students, still less for one student, would have been an abuse of the discretion with which the curators were entrusted. And, apparently, it was because of that discre- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 337, 348]\n\u00a0\n tion, and of the postponement which its exercise in accordance with the terms of the statute would entail until necessity and practicability appeared, that the state court considered and upheld as adequate the provision for the legal education of negroes, who were citizens of Missouri, in the universities of adjacent States. We may put on one side respondents' contention that there were funds available at Lincoln University for the creation of a law department and the suggestions with respect to the number of instructors who would be needed for that purpose and the cost of supplying them. The president of Lincoln University did not advert to the existence or prospective use of funds for that purpose when he advised petitioner to apply to the State Superintendent of Schools for aid under Section 9622. At best, the evidence to which argument as to available funds is addressed admits of conflicting inferences, and the decision of the state court did not hinge on any such matter. In the light of its ruling we must regard the question whether the provision for the legal education in other States of negroes resident in Missouri is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirement of equal protection, as the pivot upon which this case turns.\n The state court stresses the advantages that are afforded by the law schools of the adjacent States, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois, which admit non-resident negroes. The court considered that these were schools of high standing where one desiring to practice law in Missouri can get 'as sound, comprehensive, valuable legal education' as in the University of Missouri; that the system of education in the former is the same as that in the latter and is designed to give the students a basis for the practice of law in any State where the Anglo-American system of law obtains; that the law school of the University of Missouri does not specialize in Missouri law and that the course of study and the case books used \n\n[305 \nU.S. 337, 349]\n\u00a0\n in the five schools are substantially identical. Petitioner insists that for one intending to practice in Missouri there are special advantages in attending a law school there, both in relation to the opportunities for the particular study of Missouri law and for the observation of the local courts,3 and also in view of the prestige of the Missouri law school among the citizens of the State, his prospective clients. Proceeding with its examination of relative advantages, the state court found that the difference in distances to be traveled afforded no substantial ground of complaint and that there was an adequate appropriation to meet the full tuition fees which petitioner would have to pay.\n We think that these matters are beside the point. The basic consideration is not as to what sort of opportunities, other States provide, or whether they are as good as those in Missouri, but as to what opportunities Missouri itself furnishes to white students and denies to negroes solely upon the ground of color. The admissibility of laws separating the races in the enjoyment of privileges afforded by the State rests wholly upon the equality of the privileges which the laws give to the separated groups within the State. The question here is not of a duty of the State to supply legal training, or of the quality of the training which it does supply, but of its duty when it provides such training to furnish it to the residents of the State upon the basis of an equality of right. By the operation of the laws of Missouri a privilege has been created for white law students which is denied to negroes by reason of their race. The white resident is afforded legal education within the State; the negro resident having the same qualifications is refused it there and must go outside the State to obtain it. That is a denial of the equality of legal right to the enjoyment of the privilege \n\n[305 \nU.S. 337, 350]\n\u00a0\n which the State has set up, and the provision for the payment of tuition fees in another State does not remove the discrimination.\n The equal protection of the laws is 'a pledge of the protection of equal laws'. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 369\n, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 1070. Manifestly, the obligation of the State to give the protection of equal laws can be performed only where its laws operate, that is, within its own jurisdiction. It is there that the equality of legal right must be maintained. That obligation is imposed by the Constitution upon the States severally as governmental entities,-each responsible for its own laws establishing the rights and duties of persons within its borders. It is an obligation the burden of which cannot be cast by one State upon another, and no State can be excused from performance by what another State may do or fail to do. That separate responsibility of each State within its own sphere is of the essence of statehood maintained under our dual system. It seems to be implicit in respondents' argument that if other States did not provide courses for legal education, it would nevertheless be the constitutional duty of Missouri when it supplied such courses for white students to make equivalent provision for negroes. But that plain duty would exist because it rested upon the State independently of the action of other States. We find it impossible to conclude that what otherwise would be an unconstitutional discrimination, with respect to the legal right to the enjoyment of opportunities within the State, can be justified by requiring resort to opportunities elsewhere. That resort may mitigate the inconvenience of the discrimination but cannot serve to validate it.\n Nor can we regard the fact that there is but a limited demand in Missouri for the legal education of negroes as excusing the discrimination in favor of whites. We had occasion to consider a cognate question in the case \n\n[305 \nU.S. 337, 351]\n\u00a0\n of McCabe v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co., supra. There the argument was advanced, in relation to the provision by a carrier of sleeping cars, dining and chair cars, that the limited demand by negroes justified the State in permitting the furnishing of such accommodations exclusively for white persons. We found that argument to be without merit. It made, we said, the constitutional right 'depend upon the number of persons who may be discriminated against, whereas the essence of the constitutional right is that it is a personal one. Whether or not particular facilities shall be provided may doubtless be conditioned upon there being a reasonable demand therefor; but, if facilities are provided, substantial equality of treatment of persons traveling under like conditions cannot be refused. It is the individual who is entitled to the equal protection of the laws, and if he is denied by a common carrier, acting in the matter under the authority of a state law, a facility or convenience in the course of his journey which, under substantially the same circumstances, is furnished to another traveler, he may properly complain that his constitutional privilege has been invaded'. Id., 235 U.S. pages 161, 162, 35 S.Ct. page 71.\n Here, petitioner's right was a personal one. It was as an individual that he was entitled to the equal protection of the laws, and the State was bound to furnish him within its borders facilities for legal education substantially equal to those which the State there afforded for persons of the white race, whether or not other negroes sought the same opportunity.\n It is urged, however, that the provision for tuition outside the State is a temporary one,-that it is intended to operate merely pending the establishment of a law department for negroes at Lincoln University. While in that sense the discrimination may be termed temporary, it may nevertheless continue for an indefinite period by reason of the discretion given to the curators of Lincoln \n\n[305 \nU.S. 337, 352]\n\u00a0\n University and the alternative of arranging for tuition in other States, as permitted by the state law as construed by the state court, so long as the curators find it unnecessary and impracticable to provide facilities for the legal instruction of negroes within the State. In that view, we cannot regard the discrimination as excused by what is called its temporary character.\n We do not find that the decision of the state court turns on any procedural question. The action was for mandamus But it does not appear that the remedy would have been deemed inappropriate if the asserted federal right had been sustained. In that situation the remedy by mandamus was found to be a proper one in University of Maryland v. Murray, supra. In the instant case, the state court did note that petitioner had not applied to the management of Lincoln University for legal training. But, as we have said, the state court did not rule that it would have been the duty of the curators to grant such an application, but on the contrary took the view, as we understand it, that the curators were entitled under the state law to refuse such an application and in its stead to provide for petitioner's tuition in an adjacent State. That conclusion presented the federal question as to the constitutional adequacy of such a provision while equal opportunity for legal training within the State was not furnished, and this federal question the state court entertained and passed upon. We must conclude that in so doing the court denied the federal right which petitioner set up and the question as to the correctness of that decision is before us. We are of the opinion that the ruling was error, and that petitioner was entitled to be admitted to the law school of the State University in the absence of other and proper provision for his legal training within the State.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 337, 353]\n\u00a0\n Separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n Considering the disclosures of the record, the Supreme Court of Missouri arrived at a tenable conclusion and its judgment should be affirmed. That court well understood the grave difficulties of the situation and rightly refused to upset the settled legislative policy of the State by directing a mandamus.\n In Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education, \n175 \nU.S. 528, 545\n, 20 S.Ct. 197, 201, this Court through Mr. Justice Harlan declared-'The education of the people in schools maintained by state taxation is a matter belonging to the respective states, and any interference on the part of Federal authority with the management of such schools cannot be justified except in the case of a clear and unmistakable disregard of rights secured by the supreme law of the land.' Gong Lum v. Rice, \n275 \nU.S. 78, 85\n, 48 S.Ct. 91, 93-opinion by Mr. Chief Justice Taft-asserts: 'The right and power of the state to regulate the method of providing for the education of its youth at public expense is clear.'\n For a long time Missouri has acted upon the view that the best interest of her people demands separation of whites and negroes in schools. Under the opinion just announced, I presume she may abandon her law school and thereby disadvantage her white citizens without improving petitioner's opportunities for legal instruction; or she may break down the settled practice concerning separate schools and thereby, as indicated by experience, damnify both races. Whether by some other course it may be possible for her to avoid condemnation is matter for conjecture.\n The State has offered to provide the negro petitioner opportunity for study of the law-if perchance that is the thing really desired-b paying his tuition at some nearby school of good standing. This is far from unmistakable disregard of his rights and in the circum- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 337, 354]\n\u00a0\n stances is enough to satisfy any reasonable demand for specialized training. It appears that never before has a negro applied for admission to the Law School and none has ever asked that Lincoln University provide legal instruction.\n The problem presented obviously is a difficult and highly practical one. A fair effort to solve it has been made by offering adequate opportunity for study when sought in good faith. The State should not be unduly hampered through theorization inadequately restrained by experience.\n This proceeding commenced in April, 1936. Petitioner then twenty-four years old asked mandamus to compel his admission to the University in September, 1936, notwithstanding plain legislative inhibition. Mandamus is not a writ of right but is granted only in the court's discretion upon consideration of all the circumstances. Duncan Townsite Company v. Lane, Secretary of the Interior, \n245 \nU.S. 308, 311\n, 38 S.Ct. 99, 100; United States ex rel. Arant v. Lane, Secretary of the Interior, \n249 \nU.S. 367, 371\n, 39 S.Ct. 293, 294.\n The Supreme Court of Missouri did not consider the propriety of granting the writ under the theory of the law now accepted here. That, of course, will be matter open for its consideration upon return of the cause.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER concurs in the above views. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ex parte Virginia, \n100 \nU.S. 313, 346\n, 347 S.; Neal v.

No costs are required to be paid by the State in any suit in which the State of Oklahoma, on the relation of the Bank Commissioner, is a party, and preference is directed to be given in the courts of the State to all matters pending in such suits. Id.\n The proposed complaint alleges that in May, 1931, the Bank Commissioner took possession of the Osage Bank of Fairfax, Osage County, finding it to be insolvent, and proceeded to wind up its affairs and enforce the personal liability of its stockholders; that the defendant, R. M. Cook, was the owner of sixty-nine shares of the capital stock of the bank of the par value of $100, and became liable to the State of Oklahoma, upon the relation of its Bank Commissioner, in the sum of $6,900, with interest; that the defendant has paid the sum of $2,300 in part satisfaction and that the balance is due; that the Bank Commissioner has liquidated all the assets of the bank except the claim here presented and certain other claims against other stockholders; that dividends have been paid to depositors and creditors amounting to ninety-one per cent. of their claims and that the enforcement of the statutory liability of the defendant is necessary to discharge the liabilities of the bank.\n In answer to the rule to show cause why leave to bring this suit should not be granted, the proposed defendant contends that the cause of action is not within article 3,  2, cl. 2, of the Constitution, U.S.C.A. Const. art. 3,  2, cl. 2, providing for the original jurisdiction of this Court.\n The purpose in creating the stockholder's liability, the authority conferred upon the Bank Commissioner to enforce it, and the relation of the State to its enforcement, \n\n[304 \nU.S. 387, 390]\n\u00a0\n are clearly set forth in the decisions of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma. In State ex rel. Mothersead v. Kelly, 141 Okl. 36, 284 P. 65, the court said:\n'What is this stockholder's liability, and for whose benefit is it created?\n\n'It was designed solely for the benefit of creditors and constitutes a fund available only when the bank is insolvent and thus rendered unable to meet its liabilities in full. The corporation itself has no authority over the fund, and cannot either compel its payment nor by any act on its part release the stockholders therefrom. It amounts, for all practical purposes, to a reserve or trust fund, to be resorted to only in proceedings in liquidation, when necessary to meet the payment of obligations of the corporation. It is limited to an amount equal to the par value of the stock held and owned by each stockholder, and exists in favor of the creditors collectively, not separately, and in proportion to the amount of their respective claims against the corporation. ...' Id., pages 37, 38, 284 P., page 66.\n\n The court added that 'the bank commissioner, alone, is empowered by law to prosecute an action to enforce the stockholders' liability.' Id., page 41, 284 P. page 69. See, also, American Exchange Bank v. Rowsey, 144 Okl. 172, 173, 289 P. 726; Griffin v. Brewer, 167 Okl. 654, 655, 31 P.2d 619.\n In State ex rel. Murray v. Pure Oil Co., 169 Okl. 507, 37 P.2d 608, referring to the provision of the statute authorizing the Bank Commissioner to institute all suits necessary for the liquidation of the assets of the insolvent corporations taken over by him and providing that such suits shall be brought in the name of the State, on the relation of the Bank Commissioner, the court said:\n'Since the state is the proper party plaintiff by virtue of the above statute, it may maintain the action, regardless of whether i i  the real party in interest or merely \n\n[304 \nU.S. 387, 391]\n\u00a0\n a nominal plaintiff for the use and benefit of depositors and creditors. An action may be maintained by one expressly authorized by statute, even though that person is not in fact the real party in interest. Section 144, O.S.1931 (12 Okl.St.Ann.  223) ...\n\n'The protection of depositors of insolvent state banks is a distinct economic policy of the state. ... In so far as the object of this action is to further the established economic policy of the state, the state may be said to have a real interest created by its governmental policy, as distinguished from a mere nominal interest, even though the pecuniary benefits of the litigation, if ultimately successful, go to the depositors and creditors of the insolvent bank.\n\n'The statute (section 9173, supra (6 Okl.St.Ann.  149)) which authorizes the state to be a party plaintiff names the bank commissioner as the proper officer to institute legal actions and carry out this economic policy. ...\n\n'The nature of the powers vested by law in the bank commissioner have been many times considered by this court and their exclusive character recognized. ...\n\n'It was legislative intent that litigation of this character should be instituted and conducted under the direct supervision of the bank commissioner through the staff of legal assistants provided by law for that purpose and not by the Governor nor through independent action.' Id., pages 509-512, 37 P.2d page 610.\n\n Again, in Richison v. State ex rel. Barnett, 176 Okl. 537, 539, 56 P. 2d 840, 843, the court observed: 'Under the provisions of article 6, chapter 40, O.S.1931 (section 9168 et seq. (6 Okl.St.Ann.  144 et seq.)) the state has assumed exclusive jurisdiction and control of the affairs of insolvent banking institutions. By operation of law the bank commissioner is the officer through which the state liquidates the assets and winds up the affairs of such institutions. While engaged in the performance of such statutory \n\n[304 \nU.S. 387, 392]\n\u00a0\n duties and functions, the bank commissioner is performing duties for the benefit of certain members of the public who were depositors in such institution.'\n The state court has also held that the statute of limitations does not run against the State in an action to enforce the statutory liability of the stockholders. State ex rel. Shull v. McLaughlin, 159 Okl. 4, 12 P. 2d 1106. And the same rule applies to actions on promissory notes and other claims taken over by the Bank Commissioner as assets of an insolvent bank. White v. State, 94 Okl. 7, 220 P. 624; Lever v. State, 157 Okl. 162, 11 P.2d 498; Richison v. State ex rel. Barnett, supra.\n May the State through its Bank Commissioner invoke our original jurisdiction to prosecute claims of this character for the benefit of creditors?\n To bring a case within that jurisdiction, it is not enough that a State is plaintiff. Florida v. Mellon, \n273 \nU.S. 12, 17\n, 47 S.Ct. 265, 266. Nor is it enough that a State has acquired the legal title to a cause of action against the defendant, where the recovery is sought for the benefit of another who is the real party in interest. New Hampshire v. Louisiana, New York v. Louisiana, \n108 \nU.S. 76\n, 2 S.Ct. 176. In those cases provision was made by statutes of New Hampshire and New York for the assignment to the State of the obligations of another State. Thereupon it became the duty of the Attorney General of the State, if in his opinion the claim was a valid one, to bring suit in the name of the State in this Court in order to enforce collection. The money collected was to be held in trust, as stated, and to be paid over to the assignor of the claim. Id., pages 77, 79, 2 S.Ct. 176. The States, respectively, acquired title to bonds of the State of Louisiana and filed in this Court bills in equity in the name of the State to enforce recovery. The bills were dismissed. The fact that the effort was made to use the name of the complainant States in order to evade the applicatio o f the Eleventh Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. Amend. 11, \n\n[304 \nU.S. 387, 393]\n\u00a0\n was undoubtedly a controlling consideration, but that consideration derived its force from the fact that the State was not seeking a recovery in its own interest, as distinguished from the rights and interests of the individuals who were the real beneficiaries.\n The underlying point of the decision was that in determining the scope of our original jurisdiction under clause 2 of section 2 of article 3 of the Constitution, U.S.C.A.Const. art. 3,  2, cl. 2, we must look beyond the mere legal title of the complaining State to the cause of action asserted and to the nature of the State's interest. So, when it appeared in a later case that a State, invoking the original jurisdiction of this Court to enforce the bonds of another State, was the absolute owner of the bonds and was prosecuting the claim upon its own behalf, this Court took jurisdiction. South Dakota v. North Carolina, \n192 \nU.S. 286\n, 24 S.Ct. 269. There the Court found that, while the State of South Dakota acquired by gift the bonds of North Carolina, there could not be 'any question respecting the title of South Dakota.' (page 272) They were not held, the Court said, by the State as representative of individual owners as in the case of New Hampshire v. Louisiana, \n108 \nU.S. 76\n, 2 S.Ct. 176, and the motive which induced the transaction was not deemed to 'affect its validity or the question of jurisdiction.' The case was thus one 'directly affecting the property rights and interests of a state.' Id., pages 314, 318, 24 S.Ct., page 274.\n In determining whether the State is entitled to avail itself of the original jurisdiction of this Court in a matter that is justiciable (see Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447, 485\n, 43 S.Ct. 597, 600), the interests of the State are not deemed to be confined to those of a strictly proprietary character but embrace its 'quasi-sovereign' interests which are 'independent of and behind the itltes of its citizens, in all the earth and air within its domain.' Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company, \n206 \nU.S. 230, 237\n, 27 S.Ct. 618, 619, 11 Ann.Cas. 488. Thus, we have held that a State may sue to restrain the diversion of water from \n\n[304 \nU.S. 387, 394]\n\u00a0\n an interstate stream (Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 95\n, 96 S., 27 S.Ct. 655) or an interference with the flow of natural gas in interstate commerce (Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, \n262 \nU.S. 553, 592\n, 43 S.Ct. 658, 663, 32 A.L.R. 300); or to prevent injuries through the pollution of streams or the poisoning of the air by the generation of noxious gases destructive of crops and forests, whether the injury be due to the action of another State or of individuals. Missouri v. Illinois, \n180 \nU.S. 208\n, 21 S.Ct. 331; Id., \n200 \nU.S. 496\n, 26 S.Ct. 268; Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Company, supra; North Dakota v. Minnesota, \n263 \nU.S. 365, 373\n, 374 S., 44 S.Ct. 138, 139; Wisconsin v. Illinois, \n278 \nU.S. 367\n, 49 S.Ct. 163; Id., \n281 \nU.S. 179\n, 50 S.Ct. 266.\n But this principle does not go so far as to permit resort to our original jurisdiction in the name of the State but in reality for the benefit of particular individuals, albeit the State asserts an economic interest in the claims and declares their enforcement to be a matter of state policy. In Kansas v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 331\n, 27 S.Ct. 388, the State asked leave to file a bill of complaint against the United States and others, seeking a decree adjudging the State to be the owner, as trustee for a railway company, of certain sections of land to the extent of a grant along the line of the railroad through the Creek Nation in the Indian Territory. The Court said that it appeared upon the face of the bill that the State was only nominally a party, that the real party in interest was the railroad company, and that our original jurisdiction 'cannot be maintained.' Id., pages 340, 34, 27 S.Ct. page 390. The Court also held that the United States was the real party in interest as defendant and could not be sued without its consent, but the other question was presented and passed upon.\n In Oklahoma v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co., \n220 \nU.S. 277\n, 31 S.Ct. 434, the State sought to maintain an action in this Court against the carrier to restrain it from charging unreasonable rates within Oklahoma. Setting forth the congressional grant under which the railway in question was \n\n[304 \nU.S. 387, 395]\n\u00a0\n operated and insisting that the Company was not entitled to charge the inhabitants of Oklahoma a greater freight rate for the transportation of certain commodities than that authorized for similar service in Kansas, the State alleged its interest in the development of its communities and in the success of its industries, and the menace to the future of the State through what was deemed to be a violation of the conditions of the grant. But the Court pointed out that the State was not seeking to protect a direct interest of its own in the transportation of the commodities in question, but was endeavoring to compel the railway company to respect the rights of the shippers of these commodities. Id., pages 286, 287, 31 S.Ct. 434. The bill was dismissed. The Court summarized its conclusion in these words: 'We are of opinion that the words in the Constitution conferring original jurisdiction on this court in a suit 'in which a state shall be a party' are not to be interpreted as conferring such jurisdiction in every cause in which the state elects to make itself strictly a party plaintiff of record, and seeks not to protect its own property, but only to vindicate the wrongs of some of its people, or to enforce its own laws or public policy against wrongdoers generally.' Id., page 289, 31 S.Ct., page 437.\n See, also, Louisiana v. Texas, \n176 \nU.S. 1\n, 20 S.Ct. 251.\n In the instant case, the State has taken the legal title to the assets of the insolvent bank which is being liquidated and to the claims against stockholders by reason of their statutory liability. But recovery is sought solely for the benefit of the depositors and creditors of the bank. State ex rel. Mothersead v. Kelly, supra; State ex rel. Murray v. Pure Oil Co., supra; Richison v. State ex rel. Barnett, supra. Constituting the State a virtual trustee for the benefit of the creditors of the bank did not alter the essential quality of the rights asserted or avail to con- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 387, 396]\n\u00a0\n fer jurisdiction upon this Court to entertain a suit for their enforcement. New Hampshire v. Louisiana, New York v. Louisiana, supra; Kansas v. United States, supra; Oklahoma v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R.R. Co., supra. The taking of the legal title by the State is a mere expedient for the purpose of collection.\n It will be noted that the State not only undertakes to enforce the statutory liability of stockholders but, as the State takes title to all the assets of the insolvent bank, suits upon promissory notes and various claims of the bank in the course of the liquidation are to be brought in the name of the State acting through its Bank Commissioner. The declared policy and asserted economic interest of the State attach as well to the prosecution of all such suits. If the contention of the State were accepted, it would follow that suits upon claims of the bank against citizens of other States could be brought in this Court. Many States have statutory provisions for the liquidation through state officers of insolvent banks, trust companies, insurance companies, etc., and if, by the simple expedient of providing that the title to the assets of such institutions should vest in the State and that suits in the course of liquidation should be prosecuted in the name of the State, resort to our original jurisdiction were permitted, the enormous burden which would thereby be imposed upon this Court can readily be imagined,-a burden foreign to the purpose of the constitutional provision. These considerations emphasize the impota nce of strict adherence to the governing principle that the State must show a direct interest of its own and not merely seek recovery for the benefit of individuals who are the real parties in interest.\n The motion for leave to file complaint is denied.\n It is so ordered.\n Motion for leave to file complaint denied.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTOLL v. GOTTLIEB(1938)\nNo. 20\nArgued: Decided: November 21, 1938\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Dec. 19, 1938\n\n\n See \n305 \nU.S. 675\n, 59 S.Ct. 250, 83 L.Ed. --. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 165, 166]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. W. Froehde, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. David J. Shipmen, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 165, 167]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This certiorari was allowed to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois. That court had denied effect to a plea of res judicata arising from orders of a district court in bankruptcy. Provisions declaring the supremacy of the Constitution and the extent of the judicial power and authorizing necessary and proper legislation to make the grants effective confer jurisdiction upon this Court to determine the effect to be given decrees of a court of the United States in state courts. \n1\n As the contention is that the ruling below disregarded decrees of a court of the United States it raised a federal question reviewable under Section 237(b) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  344(b).2 \n\n[305 \nU.S. 165, 168]\n\u00a0\n The admission of facts and uncontroverted allegations of the pleadings show that Ten Fifteen North Clark Building Corporation filed a petition for reorganization on June 20, 1934, under Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  207, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois; that the petition was approved as properly filed shortly thereafter, and that notice of the proceedings was given to the creditors, one of whom was respondent William Gottlieb. A proposed plan of reorganization was filed by the debtor which provided for the substitution of one share of common stock in the Olympic Hotel Building Corporation for each $100 principal amount of the outstanding first mortgage, 6 1\/2% gold bonds of the debtor corporation, the discharge of the bonds and the cancellation of a guaranty endorsed on them. The guaranty was one of J. O. Stoll, petitioner here, and S. A. Crowe, Jr., to pay the bond. Its material provisions are stated below. \n3\n The extinction of the personal guaranty was in consideration 'for the transfer of all the assets of said Debtor (i.e., the Building Corpora- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 165, 169]\n\u00a0\n tion) to the Olympic Hotel Building Corporation and the surrender of the said Common Stock of the Debtor.' Crowe and Stoll, together with other stockholders of the debtor, 'filed their acceptances in writing' of the plan.\n On notice to respondent and a hearing at which he did not appear the proposed plan of reorganization with the provision for the extinction of the guaranty was confirmed over the objections of creditors of the same class as respondent. The confirmation provided that all creditors of the debtor should be bound. It also appears that, in accordance with the plan, the guarantors caused the assets of the debtor to be transferred to the new corporation and surrendered the capital stock of the debtor. After the institution of the present action in the state court Gottlieb filed a petition in the proceedings for reorganization of the Ten Fifteen North Clark Building Corporation praying that an order be entered vacating or modifying the decrees and orders entered in the proceedings confirming the plan of reorganization, on the ground that the district court in proceedings for reorganization did not have power or jurisdiction to cancel the guaranty. An order was entered denying this petition. No appeal was taken from any of the bankruptcy orders.\n Subsequent to the confirmation of the plan of reorganization but before the petition to vacate these orders Gottlieb began an action in the Municipal Court of Chicago against the guarantors Crowe and Stoll to recover upon their guaranty of three of the $500 bonds of Ten Fifteen North Clark Building Corporation. Crowe was not served with summons. Stoll defended on the ground that the order of the bankruptcy court confirming the plan of reorganization with release of his guaranty and its further order, denying Gottlieb's petition to set aside the decree providing for the release of the guaranty, were res judicata. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 165, 170]\n\u00a0\n The Municipal Court granted the relief sought by the bondholder, the appellate court reversed and its judgment was in turn reversed by the Supreme Court of Illinois which affirmed the judgment of the Municipal Court. \n4\n Two justices dissented.\n The Congress enacted, as one of the earlier statutes, provisions for giving effect to the judicial proceedings of the courts. This has long had its present form. \n5\n This statute is broader than the authority granted by Article 4, section 1, of the Constitution, U.S.C.A.Const. art. 4,  1, to prescribe the manner of proof and the effect of the judicial proceedings of states. Under it the judgments and decrees of the Federal courts in a state are declared to have the same dignity in the courts of that state as those of its own courts in a like case and under similar circumstances. \n6\n But where the judgment or decree of the Federal court determines a right under a Federal statute, that decision is 'final until reversed in an appellate court, or modified or set aside in the court of its rendition.' \n7\n As this plea was based upon an adjudication under the reorganization pro- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 165, 171]\n\u00a0\n visions of the Bankruptcy Act, effect as res judicata is to be given the Federal order, if it is concluded it was an effective judgment in the court of its rendition. The problem before the Supreme Court of Illinois was not one of full faith and credit but of res judicata. In this particular case, a federal question was involved. This was the power of the Federal courts to protect those who come before them relying upon constitutional rights or rights given, as in this case, through a statute enacted pursuant to constitutional grants of power.\n The inquiry is to be directed at the conclusiveness of the order releasing the guarantor from his obligation, assuming the Bankruptcy Court did not have jurisdiction of the subject matter of the order, the release in reorganization of a guarantor from his guaranty of the debtor's obligations. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n A court does not have the power, by judicial fiat, to extend its jurisdiction over matters beyond the scope of the authority granted to it by its creators. There must be admitted, however, a power to interpret the language of the jurisdictional instrument and its application to an issue before the court. 9 Where adversary parties appear, a court must have the power to determine whether or not it has jurisdiction of the person of a litigant,10 or whether its geographical jurisdiction covers the place of the occurrence under consideration. \n11\n Every court in rendering a judgment tacitly, if not expressly, determines its juris- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 165, 172]\n\u00a0\n diction over the parties and the subject matter. 12 An erroneous affirmative conclusion as to the jurisdiction does not in any proper sense enlarge the jurisdiction of the court until passed upon by the court of last resort, and even then the jurisdiction becomes enlarged only from the necessity of having a judicial determination of the jurisdiction over the subject matter. When an erroneous judgment, whether from the court of first instance or from the court of final resort, is pleaded in another court or another jurisdiction the question is whether the former judgment is res judicata. After a Federal court has decided the question of the jurisdiction over the parties as a contested issue, the court in which the plea of res judicata is made has not the power to inquire again into that jurisdictional fact.13. We see no reason why a court in the absence of an allegation of fraud in obtaining the judgment, should examine again the question whether the court14 making the earlier determination on an actual contest over jurisdiction between the parties, did have jurisdiction of the subject matter of the litigation. In this case the order upon the petition to vacate the confirmation settled the contest over jurisdiction.\n Courts to determine the rights of parties are an integral part of our system of government. It is just as important that there should be a place to end as that there should be a place to begin litigation. After a party has his day in court, with opportunity to present his evidence and his view of the law, a collateral attack upon the decision as to jurisdiction there rendered merely retries the issue previously determined. There is no reason to expect that the second decision will be more satisfactory than the first. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 165, 173]\n\u00a0\n That a former judgment in a state court is conclusive between the parties and their privies in a Federal court when entered upon an actually contested issue as to the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter of the litigation, has been determined by this Court in Forsyth v. Hammond. \n15\n The respondent, Caroline M. Forsyth, sought by injunction in the Federal court to forbid the City of Hammond from collecting taxes on certain lands, annexed to the city by an earlier state court decree. The city contended that the earlier decree was decisive, the respondent that it was void because the enlargement of a city was a matter of legislative, not judicial, cognizance. Without determining the issue whether annexation itself is a function solely of the legislature, this Court upheld the contention of the city on the ground that the respondent had taken an appeal to the Supreme Court of Indiana from the earlier decree of the trial court against her in the annexation proceedings, and had in that appeal attacked the validity of the decree on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. 'Having litigated a question in one competent tribunal and been defeated, can she litigate the same question in another tribunal acting independently and having no appellate jurisdiction? The question is not whether the judgment of the supreme court would be conclusive as to the question involved in another action between other parties, but whether it is not binding between the same parties in that or any other forum.' \n16\n\u00a0\n\n Other instances closely approaching the line of this case may be examined.\n In Des Moines Navigation & Railroad Company v. Iowa Homestead Company, 17 this Court was called upon to resolve a controversy over the effect of a judgment of the Federal \n\n[305 \nU.S. 165, 174]\n\u00a0\n courts in a matter beyond their jurisdiction. The suit was brought by the Homestead Company in the state court to recover certain taxes which were the subject of litigation between the same parties in Iowa Homestead Company v. Valley Railroad, 17 Wall. 153. In the earlier case the decision had been adverse to the Homestead Company. When the Navigation Company pleaded the earlier decree in bar to the later action, it was met with the reply that the courts of the United States, which had rendered the earlier decree 'had no jurisdiction of said suit, and no legal power or authority to render said decree or judgment.' The reason for this assertion was that the earlier suit had been instituted in a state court by the Homestead Company, an Iowa corporation, against various non-resident defendants and the Navigation Company, also an Iowa corporation. The individual defendants caused a removal to the Federal court and all defendants, including the Navigation Company, appeared, filed answers and defended the action. The Homestead Company likewise appeared and actually contested issues in dispute with the Navigation Company. The litigation eventually reached this Court and was decided without reference to the lack of jurisdiction. In the later case this Court assumed that the exercise of jurisdiction by the United States Circuit Court over the controversy between the two Iowa corporations was improper. It was held, however, that the earlier decree was a 'prior adjudication of the matters in controversy' and a bar to the later action.\n A few years later this Court had occasion to examine again the question of the effect of a former adjudication by a United States Circuit Court in a case where this Court assumed the Circuit Court had jurisdiction of the parties but not of the subject matter. The earlier adjudication was pleaded in bar to a suit to quiet title in a state court sitting in the same state as the Circuit Court. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 165, 175]\n\u00a0\n The state courts denied effect to the Circuit Court decree. On writ of error to the Supreme Court of Oregon this Court answered the contention that the ground upon which 'the federal court assumed jurisdiction was insufficient in law to make this case one arising under the laws of the United States' in these words:\n'But that was a question which the circuit court of the United States was competent to determine in the first instance. Its determination of it was the exercise of jurisdiction. Even if that court erred in entertaining jurisdiction, its determination of that matter was conclusive upon the parties before it, and could not be questioned by them, or either of them, collaterally, or otherwise than on writ of error or appeal to this court.' 18\n\n The decision in the Des Moines Case is not precisely parallel with the circumstances of the present case because the determination was based upon diversity of citizenship between other parties to the controversy19 and Dowell v. Applegate, supra, may likewise be seen to deviate slightly since there was color of jurisdiction in the Federal court by reason of certain allegations as to violation of Acts of Congress in the stamping of the deeds.\n A case likewise closely approaching the circumstances of the present controversy is Vallely v. Northern Fire Ins. Co.20 A corporation alleged to be engaged in the insurance business was adjudicated an involuntary bankrupt in the teeth of the Bankruptcy Act, 4b, 11 U.S.C.A.  22(b), that 'any moneyed ... corporation, except a(n) ... insurance ... corporation, ... may be adjudged an involuntary bankrupt.' There was a default, acquiescence and aid to the trustee by the bankrupt. After the time for review of the adjudication had expired, the bankrupt filed a motion to vacate the adjudication as null and void. This Court \n\n[305 \nU.S. 165, 176]\n\u00a0\n upheld the motion. It was pointed out that a determination of a jurisdictional fact, such as whether an alleged bankrupt is a farmer, binds,21 but that where there was no statute of bankruptcy applicable 'necessarily there is no power in the District Court to include,' the excepted corporation. It was thought that to recognize the binding effect of the judgment would be to extend the jurisdiction. This decision is inapplicable here because there was not an actually contested issue and order as to jurisdiction. The case is also distinguishable because the motion to vacate was made in the same bankruptcy proceeding as the order. We do not comment upon the significance of this variable.\n To appraise the cases dealing with status and transfer of title to real estate seems outside the scope of the present inquiry. The rule applied here may or may not be applicable in instances where the courts with jurisdiction of the later controversy are passing upon matters of status and real estate titles. \n 22\n\u00a0\n\n It is frequently said that there are certain strictly jurisdictional facts, the existence of which is essential to the validity of proceedings and the absence of which renders the act of the court a nullity.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1938)\nNo. 746\nArgued: April 25, 1938Decided: May 16, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[304 \nU.S. 351, 352]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert A. Taft, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Mr. Warner W. Garnder, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented is whether the petitioner, as executor, may deduct from the gross estate amounts payable pursuant to the decedent's binding promises as claims against the estate incurred bona fide and for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth within the meaning of section 303(a) (1), or as transfers to charitable or educational institutions under section 303(a)(3) of the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 351, 353]\n\u00a0\n Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 72, 26 U.S.C.A.  412 and note. 1 The deductions were of amounts owing at the decedent's death upon the following contractual obligations.\n By letter the decedent agreed with the University of Cincinnati to estblish a fund as a memorial to her husband, stating that she would make available to the trustees of the fund, whom she named, during the ensuing year, $50,000, during the following year $75,000, and, in each succeeding year, $100,000 or such other income as might be derived from a fund of $2, 000,000 which she would ultimately transfer to the trustees. The letter outlined the terms of the trust to which the income was to be devoted. The offer was formally accepted by the Board of Directors of the University and, pursuant to the agreement, the decedent made payments to the trustees and her executor continued to pay sums on account of interest and principal. The University is an educational institution and no profit enures to anyone from its operation. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 351, 354]\n\u00a0\n Being deeply interested in the Cincinnati Institute of Fine Arts and its work, and having jointly with her husband and as an individual contributed large sums to this work, the decedent, to obviate the necessity of reducing the personnel of the orchestra the Institute conducts, agreed with the Institute that if it would retain two musicians she would pay their salaries under contracts covering two years. In reliance upon her promise the Institute re-engaged the two men. The decedent paid the amount of their salaries prior to her death and petitioner, as executor, paid them to the end of the contract term. The Institute would not have re-employed these men except for the agreement. It is a charitable corporation organized for the maintenance of a symphony orchestra and other activities, and no profit enures to anyone from its operations.\n The decedent agreed by letter addressed to the Cincinnati Institute of Fine Arts that if it would employ a director of art she would contribute $10,000 towards his salary. In reliance upon this undertaking the institution engaged such a director at a salary of $10,000 per annum. She paid the stipulated amount for one and one-half years prior to her death and the petitioner, as executor, paid for one year subsequent to her death. There were no available funds for the employment of a director except those received from the decedent and the Institute would not have employed one except for her agreement. It is an educational institution and does not operate for profit.\n In 1930 the decedent agreed with the University of Cincinnati that if it would engage a named person as professor to give a specified course of instruction she would pay the University the amount of his salary. She had made similar arrangements for prior years. The University employed the professor and would not have done so except for her agreement. At the time of her death a \n\n[304 \nU.S. 351, 355]\n\u00a0\n sum remained due according to her promise which the petitioner paid.\n The total claimed as deductible on account of these obligations was $ 2,015,420. Under the law of Ohio, the decedent's promises were and are legally binding and enforceable against her estate. The Commissioner ruled, and the Board2 and the court below3 have held that the estate's obligations in question, though contracted bona fide, were not incurred for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth as required by clause (1) and payments of the sums promised are not transfers to or for the use of any corporation organized and operating exclusively for charitable or education purposes within the meaning of clause (3) of section 303(a) of the Act. We granted certiorari, \n303 \nU.S. 631\n, 58 S.Ct. 745, 82 L.Ed. --, because of an alleged conflict of decision. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n 1. \nThe claims against the estate were not incurred or contracted for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth within the meaning of the statute. The termsus ed, the legislative history of the section, and the regulations interpreting it, require this conclusion. The conditions imposed by the decedent as to the expenditure of the money promised and the stipulation on the part of the payee to expend it in that fashion, or its compliance with the conditions, do not constitute an adequate or a full consideration in money or money's worth within the meaning of the act. If there were doubt about the matter the legislative history of the statute and the Treasury regulations would require us so \n\n[304 \nU.S. 351, 356]\n\u00a0\n to hold. The Revenue Act of 1916 permitted the deduction of the amount of claims against the estate 'allowed by the laws of the jurisdiction ... under which the estate is being administered.' \n5\n The Acts of 1918 and 1921 contain like provisions. \n6\n Under these Acts the claims in question would have been deductible as enforceable by state law irrespective of the nature of the consideration. \n7\n The Act of 1924 altered existing law and authorized the deduction of claims against an estate only to the extent that they were 'incurred or contracted bona fide and for a fair consideration in money or money's worth.' \n8\n Congress had reason to think that the phrase 'fair consideration' would be held to comprehend an instance of a promise which was honest, reasonable, and free from suspicion whether or not the consideration for it was, strictly speaking, adequate. \n9\n The words 'adequate and full consideration' were substituted by section 303(a)(1) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 26 U.S.C.A.  412 note. There must have been some reason for these successive changes. It seems evident that the purpose was to narrow the class of deductible claims, and we are not at liberty to ignore this purpose.\n The regulations of the Treasury promulgated under the Act of 1924 and the first edition applicable to that of 1926, paraphrased the statutory language. 10 The 1929 edition of Regulation 70, Art. 36, provides in part: 'A pledge or a subscription evidenced by a promissory note or otherwise, even though enforceable against the estate, is deductible only to the extent such pledge or subscription was made for an adequate and full consideration in cash or its equiva- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 351, 357]\n\u00a0\n lent received therefor by the decedent.' \n11\n Since 1929 the regulations have excluded deductions such as those in issue here. Meantime the estate tax provisions have been amended four times and the section under which the regulations were promulgated has been amended twice. We must assume that Congress was familiar with the construction put upon the section by the Treasury and was satisfied with it. The Board of Tax Appeals12 and the courts,13 with the exception of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit,14 have held that a promise to pay money to a charitable or educational institution, where the only consideration was a stipulated application of the amount received, does not constitute a claim against the estate contracted for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth notwithstanding the fact that under local law the promise is enforcable. In this view we agree.\n\n 2. \nPayments pursuant to the promises are not transfers within the meaning of section 303(a)(3), 44 Stat. 72, 26 U.S.C.A.  412 and note. The court below excluded the payments from the operation of that section upon two grounds. Both, as we think, are valid. The petitioner's payment, after the decedent's death, of a sum promised during her life, is not appropriately designated a transfer. True the decedent has promised to make a transfer but fulfillment of the promise by the executor does not relate back to the time the promise was \n\n[304 \nU.S. 351, 358]\n\u00a0\n made so as to convert her promise into a transfer by her. Here the subject of the transfer was not identified by any allocation of decedent's funds during her life. This fact adds point to the view that she made no transfer.\n Subsection (3) applies only to testamentary dispositions. The phrase is 'The amount of all bequests, legacies, devises, or transfers' to certain specified religious, charitable, scientific, literary or educational uses. The right to the deduction is qualified by the provision 'The amount of the deduction under this paragraph for any transfer shall not exceed the value of the transferred property required to be included in the gross estate.' The only transfers required to be included in the gross estate are those made in contemplation of death or to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death. \n15\n In other words, only such transfers as are testamentary in character are to be included in the gross estate, and it follows that only those of that character are deductible under subsection (3). Those here in question were clearly not such. There is no claim that the agreements were made in contemplation of death or to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death.\n\n 3. \nThe petitioner urges that all of the revenue acts have granted liberal deductions in respect of income tax and estate tax for contributions to charitable and educational purposes. He says that if the benefactions in question had been made in the form of bequests or gifts to take effect at death there would be no question of the right to the claimed deductions. He urges, therefore, that we \n\n[304 \nU.S. 351, 359]\n\u00a0\n should adopt a liberal construction of the Act to effectuate the intent of Congress even though the payments in question do not fall within the strict meaning of the words used. But we are not permitted to speculate as to the reasons why the policy evidenced with respect to other forms of gift was not extended to claims upon promises enforceable by state law. We are bound to observe the alterations made in the successive acts which, in the plain meaning of the language employed, exclude deduction of enforceable claims of the sort here involved, even though the case be a hard one. The testatrix was bound to bring her transactions within the letter of the statutory provisions and the regulations at the risk that noncompliance might deprive her estate of tax immunity as respects the pledges.\n The judgment is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 303.

Smith, Jr ., of Washington, D.C., and Hubert Howson, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Samuel E.

The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit had previously held these \n\n[302 \nU.S. 490, 492]\n\u00a0\n claims valid and infringed in Alfred Hofmann, Inc., v. Textile Machine Works, 71 F.2d 973. The patent is for an attachment for 'flat' or 'straight' knitting machines, including machines of the 'full-fashioned' type. By use of the attachment, as the specifications state, 'yarn-guides can be accurately controlled to lay a yarn over a distance less than the full length of a course being knitted, as for reinforcing or for so-called split-seam work wherein sections of fabric are connected by suture seams.' The attachment, it is stated, may be used for 'fashioning designs, as clocks, upon hosiery.'\n Flat knitting machines are adaptable to use in the manufacture of full-fashioned garments such as stockings, underwear, or sweaters. A characteristic feature of the manufacture is that the garment, or a portion of it, is knitted in a flat web which, in the course of knitting, is shaped by variation of its width, in such a way that it conforms to the contour of the body to be fitted, when its shaped edges are united in a seam. The desired variations in width are secured through control of the traverse or 'throw' of the yarn guide which brings the yarn to the needles of the machine as they knit the web. They may be and usually are set up as multiple units in a single machine capable of knitting simultaneously a number of garments of the same type.\n The object of the patented attachment in providing accurate controls for yarn guides laying a yarn over a distance less than the full width of a fabric being knitted, is either to knit an additional yarn over a particular area of the main body of the fabric so as to strengthen it or form upon it an ornamental design, or to insert in it 'split-seam work,' which is a portion of the main fabric knitted with a separate yarn and forming a distinctive design. The attachment makes it possible to lengthen and shorten the throw of the yarn guide, and thus to form designs with re- entrant angles in both reinforcement and split-seam work. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 490, 493]\n\u00a0\n The patented device embraces a rotatable spindle having threads cut upon it, in reverse, on opposite sides of its central portion, with a nut mounted upon each of its two threaded parts and moved by its revolutions so that when the spindle is turned in the one direction or the other the nuts are moved by the reversely threaded screws toward or away from each other. Carried on the nuts so as to move with them are yarn carrier stops which are so adapted and located as to serve as controls to limit the travel of carrier rods which have mounted on them the yarn guides. The function of the mechanism is to control the movement of the stops which in turn control the distance of travel of the yarn guides. This is accomplished by the movement of the stop nuts toward or away from each other by the rotation of the threaded spindle in the appropriate direction.\n Movement in conformity to a desired pattern is effected by the transmission of power from the main camshaft of the knitting machine to two ratchet wheels mounted on the end of the threaded spindle, each with an actuating pawl. The two pawls are in such relationship that when one operates its complementary ratchet wheel the spindle will rotate in one direction, and when the other operates its complementary ratchet wheel the spindle will turn in the opposite direction. The operation of the ratchet wheels is controlled by means of buttons, arranged on two endless belts propelled by the main camshaft. The buttons attached to one of the belts serve to actuate a mechanism which pushes both pawls. The buttons affixed to the other belt govern a mechanism that selectively engages one or the other of the two pawls, and thus determines the direction in which the spindle and hence the stops are to move. By suitable spacing of the buttons on the belts, the motion, which is to be imparted to the stops through the intermediate apparatus, is controlled in such fashion as to fix in advance the length of throw \n\n[302 \nU.S. 490, 494]\n\u00a0\n and hence the outline of the design which is to be incorporated in the main fabric by reinforcement or split-seam work.\n Claim 14, which may be taken as typical, defines the invention as the combination 'In a straight knitting machine (a) a set of yarn guide carrier bars for operating yarn guides traveling less than the full width of the fabric being knitted, (b) a spindle having reversed screw threads, ( c) stops operated by said spindle, (d) means for turning the spindle in either direction, (e) pattern-controlled means for determining the time of operation of the spindle, and (f) pattern-controlled means for determining the direction of rotation of the spindle.'\n As early as 1912, ten years before Schletter's original application of June, 1922, from which his patent dates, the art had devised an attachment for full-fashioned knitting machines, commercially used for reinforcing the heel portion of the stocking. One form, known as the Gotham, comprised a reversely threaded spindle, on the threads of which were mounted stops moving toward each other when the spindle rotated in one direction, and away from each other when the spindle turned in the opposite direction. The traveling stops controlled the throw of carrier bars with yarn guides which laid a reinforcing yarn at the heel of the stocking. As the reinforcement was triangular with the point above the heel gradually widening below without re-entrant angles, it was needful to rotate the spindle automatically in but one direction in order to complete the pattern. When the reinforcement had been knitted the spindle was rotated by hand in the reverse direction, or 'racked out,' until the stops were restored to their initial position, ready to knit the next stocking. A means for automatically rotating the spindle in the desired single direction was provided by a ratchet wheel mounted on the spindle, which was worked by a pawl pushed by a cam on the main shaft; \n\n[302 \nU.S. 490, 495]\n\u00a0\n the operation of the pawl was controlled by a mechanism actuated by a 'button' type of pattern belt or chain. The reinforcement could not be knitted from a single yarn carrier operating over a single area of the fabric, because the reinforced area was divided, in the completed stocking, by the seam which united the selvages of the stocking web. It was thus necessary to knit the reinforcement in two areas, using two yarn carriers, each with a throw of the desired variation in length, reaching from the selvage on either side of the stocking web inward upon the main fabric. For this purpose the lugs on the carrier rods which, in co-operation with the stops, controlled the throw, were located between the end stops of the full-fashioned machine and the stops moved by the threaded nuts on the attachment.\n It will be observed that this device, while not completely anticipating that of the patent, nevertheless exhibited every element of the claim except the 'pattern-controlled means for determining direction of rotation of the spindle.' This lack was supplied by Nusbaum, whose machine was in common use as early as 1917. As already indicated, the use of such a device in full-fashioned knitting machines to secure selvage variations was known long before the Schletter application. In order to effect this type of fashioning, the yarn carrier stops were moved and their movements controlled by stop nuts mounted on spindles with threads in reverse located at either end of the knitting machine. Two-way movement of the nuts was effected by mechanisms, under pattern belt control, suitable to rotate the spindle in either direction.\n The Nusbaum machine was a modification of the existing flat knitting machine and was designed for knitting reinforcements of variable width on sweaters which were themselves not full fashioned; that is, not narrowed in the knitting. The modification was devised for varying the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 490, 496]\n\u00a0\n throw of a secondary yarn carrier supplying yarn to needles knitting upon the main fabric a reinforcement or plaiting. To accomplish this, Nusbaum rebuilt an old full-fashioned machine by using the existing end nuts as a means of controlling the movements of the stops which determine the length of throw of a secondary yarn carrier, and supplying a new carrier bar for the primary yarn. Since the garment was not full-fashioned he placed fixed stops at the ends of the machine so that the throw of the primary thread carrier was constant. He used the old automatically reversible spindle of the full-fashioned machine as a means, wanting in the Gotham mechanism, for increasing or diminishing at will the throw of the secondary yarn carrier. Instead of the single reversibly threaded spindle of the Gotham machine, Nusbaum retained the two threaded shafts located at the ends of the principal machine, each bearing twin ratchet wheels, each of which was operated by a pawl controlled through an intermediate apparatus by buttons appropriately spaced on a pattern belt. Only a single belt was used bearing four rows of buttons, which by reversing the motion of the spindle as desired operated to vary the throw of the yarn carrier in conformity to the desired pattern.\n It is true, as petitioner urges, that the threaded spindles were located at the ends of the Nusbaum machine, and that they were separate shafts although capable of being operated in unison as if united in a single spindle such as that shown by the Gotham attachment. Even with the double spindle synchronously operated instead of the single spindle of the Gotham it was substantially the device claimed by Schletter. In converting a full-fashioned knitting machine into a different type of straight knitting machine which did not fashion the main fabric, Nusbaum embodied in it a device for accurately controlling yarn guides for laying a secondary yarn less than the length of the course being knitted, which was capa- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 490, 497]\n\u00a0\n ble of producing designs having re-entrant angles. This, according to the specifications, is one of the objects to be achieved by the patented device. The other is the making of multiple designs and split-seam work.\n As the pattern of the reinforcement or plait was to be wholly within a single area on the main fabric and did not extend to the selvage, Nusbaum used a single yarn guide instead of the two which were required in the Gotham attachment because the reinforcements were upon detached areas of the fabric. Hence his machine as set up could not do split-seam work or make double designs, which could only be knitted by employing a plurality of yarn guides with corresponding controls. But the use of the device for these different methods of knitting the secondary yarn involves but an obvious adaptation of the claimed combination to the particular work to be done. That may be accomplished by using the device exhibited by Nusbaum as well as that claimed by the patent, with the requisite number of controlled yarn guides in the case of multiple designs and with stops, both sides of which are used as carrier rod controls in the case of split- seam work. This addition of yarn guides and the varied use of the stops, even if invention, are not embraced in the claims before us.\n The addition of the reversing mechanism, used by Nusbaum and previously used in the full-fashioned machine, to the elements exhibited by the Gotham, for the purpose of effecting variations in the throw of the secondary yarn carrier in precisely the manner in which the throw of the primary yarn carrier had been controlled in full-fashioned machines, was plainly not invention. The addition of a new and useful element to an old combination may be patentable; but the addition must be the result of invention rather than the mere exercise of the skill of the calling, and not one plainly indicated by the prior art. Electric Cable Joint Co. v. Brooklyn Edison \n\n[302 \nU.S. 490, 498]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n292 \nU.S. 69, 79\n, 80 S., 54 S.Ct. 586, 589, 590; Altoona Publix Theatres, Inc., v. American Tri-Ergon Corporation, \n294 \nU.S. 477, 486\n, 55 S.Ct. 455, 458. The art of machine design in the knitting machine field is a highly developed one. The addition to the combination of the Gotham attachment of a means for automatically reversing the rotary threaded spindle to perform the very function it had performed in the full-fashioned knitting machine was not beyond the skill of the art and was plainly foreshadowed, if not completely anticipated, by Nusbaum.\n The claims in suit do not embrace a train of mechanism of any particular type for the transmission of control from the power shaft to the pawls and so cannot rest on any differences between the train employed by Schletter and that of earlier devices. As the court below pointed out, if the patent is valid it is either because of the novelty of the conception of employing the Nusbaum device in an attachment for a full- fashioned machine, which Nusbaum had not done, or because of technical difficulties in executing that conception. If there were such difficulties, which could be overcome only by invention, Schletter did not show what they were or define such an invention by the claims before us. He did show in his specifications how to provide, by familiar mechanical means, for one necessary relationship of the attachment to the principal machine; the necessity that the threaded spindle remain stationary while the fashioning stops are moving. For this no invention is claimed, nor well could be in view of the state of the art.\n Petitioner relies on the novelty of conception reinforced by an alleged commercial success. Commercial success may be decisive where invention is in doubt, but an insuperable obstacle to the invocation of that doctrine here is our inability, like that of the court below, to say 'that an art which knew how to reinforce 'full-fashioned' webs without re- entrant angles, and straight edged webs \n\n[302 \nU.S. 490, 499]\n\u00a0\n with such angles, required some uncommon talent merely to conceive of combining the two, for, as we have said, the patent can only stand on the bare conception.'\n It is significant that the courts which, in Alfred Hofmann, Inc., v. Textile Machine Works, supra, found invention, supported by commercial success, pointed to the novelty not of this conception, but of adding to the elements of the Gotham machine the automatic pattern controlled means for reversing the screw spindle. But neither court made mention of the Nusbaum machine which supplied that element. Upon the record before us we cannot say that the commercial success is attributable to novelty of the bare conception of the use of the attachment with full-fashioned knitting machines rather than to the skill with which the patentee devised mechanisms for making the attachment effective, but for which he made no claim, or to the strength of the hands into which the patent came.

Catesby Jones, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 68, 70]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles W. Hagen, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In a suit in admiralty, brought in a District Court by the alleged owner to recover possession of a Spanish merchant vessel, the Spanish Ambassador asked leave to intervene as claimant on the basis of an affidavit of the Spanish Acting Consul General suggesting that when the suit was brought the vessel was the property of the Republic of Spain, by virtue of a decree of attachment promulgated by the President of the Republic, appropriating the vessel to the public use, and that it was then in the possession of the Spanish Government. The principal question for decision is whether it was the duty of the court, upon presentation of the suggestion, to dismiss the libel for want of admiralty jurisdiction.\n Petitioner, a Spanish corporation, brought the present suit in admiralty in the District Court for Eastern New York against the Spanish steamship Navemar, five members of her crew, and all persons claiming an interest in her, to recover possession of the vessel. The libel alleged that petitioner was owner of the vessel, which was within the territorial jurisdiction of the court; and that while she was in petitioner's possession the individual respondents, acting as a committee of the crew, had wrongfully and forcibly seized, and had since retained possession of the vessel. After hearing evidence in support of the petition, the District Court rendered its decree upon default, directing the marshal to place libelant in possession.\n Thereupon the Spanish Ambassador filed a suggestion in the cause, challenging the jurisdiction of the court on the ground that the Navemar was a public vessel of the Republic of Spain, not subject to judicial process of the court, and asking that it direct delivery of the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 68, 71]\n\u00a0\n vessel to the Spanish Acting Consul General in New York. The suggestion alleged that when the suit was brought the Navemar was the property of the Spanish government by virtue of its decree of October 10, 1936, and was in the possession of the Republic of Spain. The District Court issued its order to show cause why the default should not be opened and the Ambassador permitted to appear specially as claimant of the vessel. After a hearing the court denied the application but with leave to the Ambassador to make further application upon fuller presentation of the facts showing the ownership and possession of the vessel by the Spanish government.\n Meanwhile the Department of State had refused to act upon the Spanish government's claim of possession and ownership of the Navemar, had declined to honor the request of the Ambassador that representations be made in the pending suit by the Attorney General of the United States in behalf of the Spanish government, and had advised the Ambassador that his government was entitled 'to appear directly before the court in a case of this character.'\n A second application by the Ambassador for leave to appear as a claimant upon a verified suggestion, stating additional circumstances relied upon to establish possession of the vessel by the Republic of Spain, was denied. The Navemar, D.C., 18 F.Supp. 153. On appeal the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, after restricting the appeal to the order of the District Court on the second application, reversed that order and directed that the libel be dismissed. 90 F.2d 673. We granted certiorari, \n302 \nU.S. 669\n, 58 S.Ct. 35, 82 L.Ed. --, because the case is of public importance and because of alleged conflict of the decision below with our decision in The Pesaro, \n255 \nU.S. 216\n, 41 S.Ct. 308, and with that of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in The Attualita, 238 F. 909.\n Respondent's suggestion on the second application presented two contentions: One, a challenge to the jurisdic- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 68, 72]\n\u00a0\n tion on the ground that the Navemar was a public vessel, immune from arrest and process of the court; the other, that the Spanish government was owner of the vessel and entitled to her possession by virtue of the decree of attachment.\n In addition to the general allegations of ownership and possession of the vessel by the Spanish government in the first application, the suggestion in the second set up the acquisition of possession in behalf of the Spanish government by specific acts of its consular officers in Argentina and in New York. It alleged that on October 26, 1936, the Spanish Consul at Rosario, Argentina, had indorsed on the ship's roll a statement that 'Through a cable dated 26 of the inst month from the Director General of the Merchant Marine this ship has become the property of the State through attachment according to the Decree of Oct. 10, 1936,' and that on October 28 the Spanish Acting Consul General at Buenos Aires had made a similar indorsement on the ship's register. It was also alleged that on arrival in New York in November the Spanish Acting Consul General at that port, by direction of the Ambassador, had instructed the master of the Navemar 'to await and abide further instructions ... as regards any further use of the' vessel, and that on November 28 he had instructed the master to render a detailed account of the expenses of the Navemar and of minor repairs that she might require. There was no averment that the alleged seizure by the members of the crew was an act of or in behalf of the Spanish government.\n The District Court allowed a full hearing upon the suggestion and upon reply affidavits submitted by libelant, in the course of which there was opportunity for the parties to present proof of all the relevant facts. Cf. Ex Parte State of New York, No. 2, \n256 \nU.S. 503\n, 41 S.Ct. 592. The court found that no one had taken possession of the Navemar in behalf \n\n[303 \nU.S. 68, 73]\n\u00a0\n of the Spanish government. It pointed out that neither the ship's roll nor its register is a document of title or possession, the ship's roll being merely a record, in the case of Spanish vessels usually deposited with the Spanish Consul while in port, showing arrivals and sailings of the vessel, the kind of cargo carried, the list of passengers, and the enrollment of the members of the crew, and the ship's register being only a record of the nationality of the vessel as determined by the place of her home port. It found that none of the consular officers mentioned had done any act purporting to take possession of the vessel; that none of them had informed the master that he wished to take possession or had any intention of doing so; that the vessel had proceeded under command of her master upon her voyage from Buenos Aires to New York, manned by officers and crew in the employ of petitioner; that upon arrival, the master, under direction of the ship's agent, had discharged cargo; and that before discharge the freight money was paid by the consignees to the agents of the time charterer in New York.\n The District Court, upon this and other evidence not necessary to detail, concluded that the Navemar was never in possession of the Spanish government before her seizure by the members of the crew in the territorial waters of the United States, and that she was not a vessel in the public service of the Spanish government.\n The Court of Appeals, without reviewing the findings of the district court, or the evidence, adverted to the allegation of the first suggestion, substantially repeated on information and belief in the second, that the Spanish Consul at Rosario 'pursuant to instructions from the Director General of the Spanish Merchant Marine, took possession of the ... Navemar in the name of the Republic of Spain ... whereby the ... Navemar then and there became and at all times since has remained the property of the Government of the Republic of Spain.' \n\n[303 \nU.S. 68, 74]\n\u00a0\n Declaring that the court was bound to accept this allegation as conclusive, it held that the vessel must be taken to be a public vessel owned by and in the possession of the Spanish government, and as such immune from suit in the courts of the United States.\n This we think was a mistaken view of the force and effect of the suggestion. Admittedly a vessel of a friendly government in its possession and service is a public vessel, even though engaged in the carriage of merchandise for hire, and as such is immune from suit in the courts of admiralty of the United States. Berizzi Bros. Co. v. S.S. Pesaro, \n271 \nU.S. 562\n, 46 S.Ct. 611; compare The Exchange v. M'Faddon, 7 Cranch 116. And in a case such as the present it is open to a friendly government to assert that such is the public status of the vessel and to claim her immunity from suit, either through diplomatic channels or, if it chooses, as a claimant in the courts of the United States.\n If the claim is recognized and allowed by the Executive Branch of the government, it is then the duty of the courts to release the vessel upon appropriate suggestion by the Attorney General of the United States, or other officer acting under his direction.

Matthias, 19 Fed.Cas. 786, No. 11,199; see The Constitution, L.R. 4 P.D. 39; compare Ex parte Muir, \n254 \nU.S. 522\n, 41 S.Ct. 185; The Parlement Belge, L.R. 4 P.D. 129. The foreign government is also entitled as of right, upon a proper showing, to appear in a pending suit, there to assert its claim to the vessel, and to raise the jurisdictional question its own name or that of its accredited and recognized representative.

Pesaro, supra.\n After refusal of the Secretary of State to act upon the present claim, the Ambassador adopted the latter course. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 68, 75]\n\u00a0\n His application to be permitted to appear and present the claim was properly entertained by the District Court. But it was not bound, as the Court of Appeals thought, to accept the allegations of the suggestion as conclusive. The Department of State having declined to act, the want of admiralty jurisdiction because of the alleged public status of the vessel and the right of the Spanish government to demand possession of the vessel as owner if it so elected were appropriate subjects for judicial inquiry upon proof of the matters alleged.\n But the filed suggestion, though sufficient as a statement of the contentions made, was not proof of its allegations. This Court has explicitly declined to give such a suggestion the force of proof or the status of a like suggestion coming from the Executive Department of our government. Ex parte Muir, supra; The Pesaro, supra. Berizzi Bros. Co. v. S.S. Pesaro, supra, did not hold otherwise for there it was stipulated that the vessel, when arrested, was owned, possessed and controlled by a foreign government and used by it in carrying merchandise for hire. The sole question was one of law, whether, upon the facts stipulated, the vessel was immune from suit.\n The District Court concluded, rightly we think, that the evidence at hand did not support the claim of the suggestion that the Navemar had been in the possession of the Spanish government. The decree of attachment, without more, did not operate to change the possession which, before the decree, was admittedly in petitioner. To accomplish that result, since the decree was in invitum, actual possession by some act of physical dominion or control in behalf of the Spanish government was needful, The Davis, 10 Wall. 15, 21; Long v. Tampico, D.C., 16 F. 491, 493, 494; The Attualita, supra; the Carlo Poma, 2 Cir., 259 F. 369, 370, reversed on other grounds \n255 \nU.S. 219\n, 41 S.Ct. 309, or at least some recognition on the part of the ship's officers that they were controlling the vessel and crew in \n\n[303 \nU.S. 68, 76]\n\u00a0\n behalf of their government. \n1\n Both were lacking, as was support for any contention that the vessel was in fact employed in public service. See Long v. Tampico, supra, 16 F. 491, 493, 494; cf. Berizzi Bros. Co. v. S.S. Pesaro, supra.\n The District Court rightly declined to treat the suggestion as conclusive or sufficient as proof to require the court to relinquish its jurisdiction. But as the suggestion was tendered in support of an application to appear as a claimant in the suit, and as it put forth a claim to title and right to possession of the vessel, the Ambassador should have been permitted to intervene and, if so advised, to litigate its claims in the suit. In Ex parte Muir, supra, and in The Pesaro, supra, \n255 \nU.S. 216, 219\n, 41 S.Ct. 308, the Ambassador of the intervening government challenged the jurisdiction of the court, but did not place himself or his government in the attitude of a suitor. Here the application as construed by the trial court was for permission to intervene as a claimant. We think the applicant should be permitted to occupy that position if so advised.\n The decree of the Court of Appeals will be reversed. The respondent will be permitted to intervene for the purpose of asserting the Spanish government's ownership and right to possession of the vessel, and the order of the District Court will be modified accordingly.\n So ordered.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In The Jupiter, L.R.1924 Prob.Div. 236, 241, 244 (compare The Jupiter No. 2, L.R.1925 Prob.Div. 69; The Jupiter No. 3, L.R.1927 Prob.Div. 122, 125), and in the recently reported The Cristina, 59 Lloyd's List Law Reports, 43, 50, on which respondent relies, the possession taken in behalf of the claimant government was actual.

BANK v. SPRAGUE(1938)\nNo. 374\nArgued: Decided: March 7, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[303 \nU.S. 406, 407]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George P. Barse, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n Mr. Harvey D. Eaton, of Waterville, Me., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether or not a secured creditor of a national bank, holding a non-interest bearing claim, is entitled to interest for any period subsequent to the insolvency of the bank, when the assets on which he has a lien are sufficient to pay the principal and interest but the total assets of the bank are not sufficient to pay in full all creditors' claims as of the date of insolvency.\n On March 28, 1931, respondent Lottie F. Sprague delivered $5,022.18 to the trust department of the Ticonic National Bank of Waterville, Maine, in trust, under an agreement which authorized the trustee to invest in bonds or securities and to deposit at least $1,000 in its savings department at usual rates of interest; required specified monthly payments subject to certain conditions, to Margaret Sprague, also a respondent here; and reserved to the grantor the right to revoke the trust and resume possession of the trust funds. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 406, 408]\n\u00a0\n The Ticonic Bank had been authorized by the Federal Reserve Board to act in a trust capacity, as provided in Section 11(k) of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended, 12 U.S.C.  248(k), 12 U.S.C.A.  248(k). That Act provides that funds held in trust awaiting investment 'shall not be used by the bank in the conduct of its business unless it shall first set aside in the trust department United States bonds or other securities' approved by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and further provides that, 'In the event of the failure of such bank the owners of the funds held in trust for investment shall have a lien on the bonds or other securities so set apart in addition to their claim against the estate of the bank.'\n Pending investment of funds under the Sprague trust, and pursuant to its resolution implementing the statutory provision just quoted, the Ticonic Bank placed the funds of this trust, along with other trust funds awaiting investment or distribution, as a deposit in its commercial checking department to the credit of its trust department, and secured the total amount of such funds by setting aside in the trust department bonds, including $20,000 Kingdom of Denmark 6's, 1942, at least equal in value to the total amount of such deposits.\n On July 29, 1935, respondents, the settlor and beneficiary, brought this suit in the District Court for Maine to have the bonds held as security with respect to the trust. It appears that on August 3, 1931, Ticonic Bank sold its assets (including the Denmark bonds) to the Peoples National Bank (later called Peoples-Ticonic National Bank) in consideration of its agreement to 'assume or pay all the indebtedness of said Ticonic Bank to its depositors'; that Ticonic Bank then went into voluntary liquidation; that on March 4, 1933, the Peoples-Ticonic Bank was closed; that Arthur Picher was appointed receiver for Peoples-Ticonic Bank on November 6, 1933, and subsequently, on June 28, 1934, for the Ti- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 406, 409]\n\u00a0\n conic Bank, which had been continuing its voluntary liquidation.\n The lower courts treated the suit, brought against both banks and against Picher as receiver, as one to assert and enforce the lien protecting the uninvested funds. They held that, in view of section 11(k) of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended, respondents had acquired a lien upon the bonds set apart by the Ticonic Bank to secure the deposit of the trust department; and that this lien had never been discharged or divested and so extended to the proceeds of the Denmark bonds, which had been sold by the receiver for $20,722.66. We do not pause to state the conclusions of fact and of law by means of which the lower courts arrived at this result, for in the grant of the writ of certiorari this Court declined to review the ruling that a statutory lien for the protection of the owners of the funds held for investment extended to the proceeds of the Denmark bonds, the lower courts having predicated their decision in large part on the facts of this particular case.\n The decrees below did not end with the matters just stated. The District Court, finding that the proceeds of the bonds exceeded the trust funds on deposit,1 held the respondents entitled to payment in full of $3, 649.65, the amount to which the Sprague trust account had been reduced, with interest from the date of the filing of the bill of complaint. At first the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that part of the decree allowing interest, but on rehearing it affirmed the decree in toto, approving the allowance of interest out of the proceeds of the Denmark bonds, which it assumed were sufficient to meet with in- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 406, 410]\n\u00a0\n terest the amount of all trust deposits. It ruled that although the requirement of ratable distribution precludes the recovery of interest against the general funds of an insolvent national bank, the general creditors have no rights in the trust funds here involved until after the secured claims are paid.\n The attention of this Court was called to the fact that the ruling conflicted with decisions in other circuits, where secured creditors were held not entitled to any interest after the suspension of the national bank,2 and for this reason certiorari was granted, limited to this question of interest. \n302 \nU.S. 675\n, 58 S.Ct. 55, 82 L.Ed. --.\n As an incident to the right to recover an unexpended balance in a deposit, a depositor is entitled to interest as damages for the failure to pay that balance upon demand. \n3\n Compare Stewart v. Barnes, \n153 \nU.S. 456, 462\n, 14 S.Ct. 849; United States v. North Carolina, \n136 \nU.S. 211, 216\n, 10 S.Ct. 920.\n The bank's obligation to pay interest as damages for the detention of the debt is not cut off by suspension of its business and receivership. The principle has been established, and claimants held entitled to such interest, in cases where the principal amount of each of the claims was paid in full from the assets of the bank (National Bank of Commonwealth v. Mechanics' National Bank, \n94 \nU.S. 437\n), including if necessary the double liability of the shareholders. Richmond v. Irons, \n121 \nU.S. 27, 64\n, 7 S.Ct. 788. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 406, 411]\n\u00a0\n It is true that in the liquidation of national banks, dividends from the general funds on unsecured claims are made pro rata upon the amount of each claim as of the date of the insolvency, White v. Knox, \n111 \nU.S. 784\n, 4 S.Ct. 686. This method of distribution gives a proportional part of the available funds to each creditor, in accordance with the statute requiring a 'ratable dividend.' Rev.St.  5236, 12 U.S.C. A.  194. Whether the reason for this method of determining dividends is to avoid prejudice from the inevitable delay of court proceedings for liquidation (In re Humber Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, IV Ch. App. Cas. 643, 646; American Iron & Steel Manufacturing Co. v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., \n233 \nU.S. 261, 266\n, 34 S.Ct. 502; cf. People v. American Loan & Trust Company, 172 N.Y. 371, 379, 65 N.E. 200); to facilitate administration (Sexton v. Dreyfus, \n219 \nU.S. 339, 344\n, 31 S.Ct. 256; Chemical National Bank v. Armstrong, 6 Cir., 59 F. 372, 387, 28 L.R.A. 231); or because on that date the creditors acquire a right in rem against the assets in the hands of the receiver (Chemical National Bank v. Armstrong, supra, 59 F. 372, 379, 28 L.R.A. 231; Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonville, \n173 \nU.S. 131, 140\n, 19 S.Ct. 360; Sexton v. Dreyfus, supra, \n219 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 31 S.Ct. 256) is immaterial. Dividends are paid on that basis. It is in order to assure equality among creditors as of the date of insolvency that interest accruing thereafter is not considered. But interest is proper where the ideal of equality is served, and so a creditor whose claim has been erroneously disallowed is entitled on its allowance to interest on his dividends from the time a ratable amount was paid other creditors. Armstrong v. American Exchange National Bank, \n133 \nU.S. 433, 470\n, 10 S.Ct. 450.\n The rule of White v. Knox, supra, does not require that interest be denied to the secured creditors unless the principle of equality of distribution is to be applied as between all creditors. Secured creditors have two sources of payment for their claims-the liability of the debtor and the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 406, 412]\n\u00a0\n liability of the pledged or mortgaged assets. One is personal, the other in rem. The liability in personam of the bank gives rise to a claim in rem against the free assets in the hands of the receiver; the claim in rem against the security continues as a claim in rem against that same security. With respect to the former the secured creditors have merely the same rights as any general creditor, and in so far as dividends are paid to secured creditors from free assets, they share ratably with the unsecured creditors, and their claims bear interest to the same date, that of insolvency. Compare Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonville, \n173 \nU.S. 131\n, at page 146, 19 S.Ct. 360; Aldrich v. Chemical National Bank, \n176 \nU.S. 618, 638\n, 20 S.Ct. 498. But to the extent that one debt is secured and another is not there is manifestly an inequality of rights between the secured and unsecured creditors, which cannot be affected by the principle of equality of distribution (American Iron & Steel Manufacturing Co. v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., supra, \n233 \nU.S. 261\n, at page 266, 34 S.Ct. 502; Chemical National Bank v. Armstrong, supra, 59 F. 372, at pages 376, 377, 28 L.R.A. 231), and interest accruing after insolvency may not be withheld on account of that principle.\n The rule as to the date to which interest is to be allowed on secured claims sharing pro rata with unsecured claims, cannot apply to the disposition of pledged or mortgaged assets subject to the lien of individual creditors, unless we are to disregard the rights in these assets acquired prior to insolvency. But 'liens, equities, or rights arising ... prior to insolvency and not in contemplation thereof, are not invalidated.' Scott v. Armstrong, \n146 \nU.S. 499, 510\n, 13 S.Ct. 148, 151; Merrill v. National Bank of Jacksonville, \n173 \nU.S. 131, 145\n, 19 S.Ct. 360. By contract or, as in this case, by statute, the secured creditors gain or are given a lien on or right in property 'in addition to their claim against the estate of the bank.' Section 11(k) of the Federal Reserve Act as amended. The statutory lien prior to receivership withdrew the pledged security from the assets \n\n[303 \nU.S. 406, 413]\n\u00a0\n of the bank available to general creditors, in so far as might be necessary to satisfy the lien. Though title to the collateral was in the name of the bank, it was subject to this lien, and to that extent the property pledged could not properly be said to belong to the bank for purposes of distribution to creditors. Scott v. Armstrong, supra, \n146 \nU.S. 499\n, at page 510, 13 S.Ct. 148\n\n\n As the obligation to pay interest is not destroyed by the insolvency and as the rights of the secured creditor in his collateral, contractual or statutory, are likewise unaffected, we are of the opinion that a secured creditor of a national bank in receivership may enforce his lien against his security, where it is sufficient to cover both principal and interest, until his claim for both is satisfied.\n With respect to analogous liquidations the rule just announced has long been in force. \n4\n This Court has already held that a lienholder may look to his lien not only for the principal but also for interest accruing up to the date of payment, though his debtor has gone into bankruptcy ( Coder v. Arts, \n213 \nU.S. 223, 245\n, 29 S.Ct. 436, 16 Ann.Cas. 1008, affirming 8 Cir, 152 F. 943, 950, 15 L.R.A.,N.S., 372) or into equity receivership (American Iron & Steel Mfg. Co. v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., \n233 \nU.S. 261\n, 34 S.Ct. 502), and though interest will be denied the unsecured creditors if the assets are insufficient to pay all claims in full. Compare In re Humber Ironworks and Shipbuilding Co., IV Ch. App. Cas. 643, with In re Humber Ironworks and Shipbuilding Co., V Ch. App. Cas. 88. The same rule was applied to state banks in Washington- Alaska Bank v. Dexter Horton National Bank. 9 Cir., 263 F. 304, 306. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 406, 414]\n\u00a0\n Petitioners suggest that the rule just laid down may have the effect of penalizing the unsecured creditors for the precaution of the receiver in litigating doubtful claims asserted against segregated assets. This could be true only where the interest accruing to the secured creditors during the pendency of the litigation exceeds the appreciation in value of, and the income from, the security. And since in many cases if the receiver is successful his conduct of the litigation will inure to the advantage of the general creditors, they may fairly be charged with the expenses of contesting the claim, including interest by way of damages. Cf. Chemical National Bank v. Armstrong, supra, 59 F. 372, at page 384, 28 L.R.A. 231.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The total uninvested trust funds on deposit in the commercial department of the Ticonic Bank amounted to about $10.000 at the time of the sale of its assets, and to about $12,000 when the Peoples-Ticonic Bank was closed in 1933. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Richman v.

Lloyd Heth and Julius Moses, both of Chicago, Ill., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether a trustee (or receiver) in bankruptcy and the surety on his official bond can be held liable for the loss resulting from the insolvency of the bank in which the estate's funds were deposited, if it was one of the depositories designated by the court under U.S.C., title 11,  101, 11 U.S.C.A.  101. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 445, 447]\n\u00a0\n Sam Howard was trustee in bankruptcy of 114 separate bankrupt estates, and was receiver of 9, in the federal court for Northern Illinois, Eastern Division. Between August 20, 1930, and June 21, 1932, he had deposited the funds of each of the 123 estates in the Phillip State Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, as ordinary commercial accounts. On the latter date the bank, being insolvent, closed its doors. The aggregate of his bankruptcy deposits in the 123 accounts was, at the time of its closing, over eight times the penalty of the bank's depository bond of $50,000. The only dividend received by the bankruptcy estates was about 11 per cent.- which was paid from the amount collected on the depository bond.\n As required by U.S.C., title 11,  78, 11 U.S.C.A.  78, Howard had given an official bond to the United States for each estate, and Continental Casualty Company was the surety. The form of the trustee's bond was not prescribed by Form 25 of the General Orders and Forms in Bankruptcy, 11 U.S.C.A. following section 53, pursuant to U.S.C., title 11 ,  53, 11 U.S.C.A.  53.\n The obligors bound themselves to pay any loss resulting to the estate from failure by Howard, (a) to obey and order of the court, (b) truly and faithfully to account for all moneys, (c) faithfully to perform his official duties as trustee. \n1\n It is agreed that the condition of the bonds given as receiver was in effect the same.\n Howard resigned as trustee or receiver of each estate. Chester A. Willoughby, who succeeded him, brought in that court, pursuant to leave, three actions in the name of the United States against Howard and the casualty \n\n[302 \nU.S. 445, 448]\n\u00a0\n company. In these actions, which were consolidated, recovery was sought on each bond on the ground that its condition had been broken by Howard's failing to perform his official duties as trustee or receiver. The failure assigned was that he negligently deposited the funds, or permitted them to remain, in the Phillip Bank, whereas ordinary care and prudence would have required him to desist from such practice and take care that the aggregate of the deposits of estate funds in that bank should not exceed the penalty of the depository bond. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaints on the ground that they failed to disclose any breach of the condition of the bonds. Upon the denial of the motions, the consolidated cases were heard before a jury on the issue whether Howard had been negligent in the performance of his official duties in so depositing the funds, or in leaving them, in the Phillip Bank.\n The following, among other facts, appeared: About 20 Chicago banks had been designated by the court as depositories of bankruptcy funds in that district. Howard, who had for years served as trustee and receiver of bankrupt estates, had, prior to August, 1930, deposited the funds of the estates either in the Central Trust Company of Illinois or the Foreman State National Bank of Chicago. In July he was solicited to transfer his bankruptcy deposits to the Phillip Bank, a small institution. He agreed to do so if the Phillip Bank should become a depository, would make him unsecured personal loans sufficient to discharge his existing personal indebtedness to the Central Trust Company and the Foreman State National Bank-and would give him thereafter like accommodation. The Phillip Bank loaned him $11,000; Howard paid his indebtedness to the other banks; and on August 20, the Phillip Bank qualified as a depository, giving a bond in the sum of $50,000. Within the next \n\n[302 \nU.S. 445, 449]\n\u00a0\n few days, Howard opened in the Phillip Bank accounts for bankruptcy estates with deposits aggregating $249,968.15. The number of his accounts, the aggregate amount on deposit, and the amount of his personal loans from that bank increased from time to time. When the bank closed, the accounts numbered 123, the deposits aggregated $416,833.90, and the loans to Howard $ 17,500. The Phillip Bank's depository bond remained at $50,000. He knew that during this period of deposit there were several heavy runs on the Phillip Bank, its deposits were steadily declining and its resources were being drained.\n Defendants' motions for a directed verdict were denied; the jury found for the plaintiff verdicts aggregating $225,740.45; a new trial was refused; and an appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, where the case was heard first by two judges, then reargued before the full court. A condensed report of the evidence and other proceedings at the trial occupies 250 pages of the printed record. Much evidence offered by defendants had been excluded; many rulings sought had been refused; and timely exception had been taken to instructions given to the jury and to those refused. Eighty-four assignments of error had been filed with the petition for appeal. But the appellate court examined only a few of the assigned errors. For it held that the trial court should have directed a verdict for the defendants, on the ground that, since Howard had deposited and maintained the funds in one of the banks designated by the court as depositories, he fully performed his official duty in respect to the care of the funds. It reversed the judgment with direction to grant a new trial and to proceed in accordance with the opinion. 7 Cir., 87 F.2d 243. One judge dissented. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the question presented, \n301 \nU.S. 677\n, 57 S.Ct. 930\n\n\n First. That the obligors in the bonds are liable only for breach by Howard of an official duty may be assumed. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 445, 450]\n\u00a0\n By the common law2 every trustee or receiver of an estate has the duty of exercising reasonable care in the custody of the fiduciary estate unless relieved of such duty by agreement, statute, or order of court. Obviously, Howard was not relieved of the duty by any agreement. The question for decision is whether under the Bankruptcy Act,3 or any order of the court, this duty in respect to the care of funds was limited to depositing them in one of the depositories designated by the court under U.S.C., title 11 ,  101, 11 U.S.C.A.  101, so that Howard was relieved of all duty to exercise care in selecting the depository and maintaining funds therein.\n Second. No statute relieved Howard of the common-law duty to exercise care in the custody of the funds. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 445, 451]\n\u00a0\n The only relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Act prescribing duties of the trustee are:\n Section 61 (U.S.C., title 11,  101, 11 U.S.C.A.  101). 'Depositories for Money. Courts of bankruptcy shall designate, by order, banking institutions as depositories for the money of bankrupt estates, as convenient as may be to the residences of trustees, and shall require bonds to the United States, subject to their approval, to be given by such banking institutions, and may from time to time as occasion may require, by like order increase the number of depositories or the amount of any bond or change such depositories.'\n Section 47 (U.S.C., title 11,  75, 11 U.S.C.A.  75). 'Duties of Trustees. (a) trustees shall respectively ...\n'(3) deposit all money received ... in one of the designated depositories;\n\n'(4) disburse money only by check or draft on the depositories in which it has been deposited;\n\n'(5) furnish such information concerning the estates ... and their administration as may be requested by parties in interest; ...\n\n'(7) lay before the final meeting of the creditors detailed statements of the administration of the estates;\n\n'(8) make final reports and file final accounts with the courts fifteen days before the days fixed for the final meetings of the creditors ; ...\n\n'(10) report to the courts, in writing, the condition of the estates and the amounts of money on hand, and such other details as may be required by the courts, within the first month after their appointment and every two months thereafter, unless otherwise ordered by the courts.'\n\n Obviously the act does not in terms relieve the trustee of the common-law duty to exercise care in the custody of funds. The designation of banks of deposit proper for bankruptcy funds, like the listing of legal investments \n\n[302 \nU.S. 445, 452]\n\u00a0\n for trustees and guardians, limits the discretion which can be exercised by the depositing officer and may render him absolutely liable for the loss of funds placed in a nondesignated depository. But the fact that the freedom of choice of the fiduciary is limited by statute does not relieve him of the duty of exercising care and prudence within the field left to his discretion. As he may not shut his eyes to the fact that a so-called legal investment is no longer sound, he may not disregard the fact that a depository proper when designated is no longer safe. \n4\n The mere imposition of statutory duties does not remove liability for breach of existing common-law duties. Compare Bowerman v. Hamner, \n250 \nU.S. 504, 510\n, 511 S., 39 S.Ct. 549; Yates v. Jones National Bank, \n206 \nU.S. 158, 178\n, 27 S.Ct. 638; Mechanics Universal Joint Co. v. Culhane, \n299 \nU.S. 51, 57\n, 57 S.Ct. 81, 84.\n Third. No order of the court limited the common-law duty of Howard to exercise care in the custody of estate funds. The Phillip Bank was designated as a depository on its own application. No order directed Howard to deposit funds in the Phillip Bank; and no order specifically authorized him to do so. Being free to select any one or more of the designated depositories, Howard was in respect thereto under the common- law obligation to exercise care in the performance of his functions as a fiduciary. While he was making deposits in the Phillip Bank there were about 20 others in the Chicago area which were designated depositories, so he had a wide range from which to choose. By designating the Phillip Bank as a depository the court may have justified Howard in assuming that on August 20, 1930, it was a trust-worthy \n\n[302 \nU.S. 445, 453]\n\u00a0\n place of deposit for bankruptcy funds to the extent of $50,000. But throughout the period of deposit the legal duty to exercise care remained. If at any time he discovered facts tending to show that the place of deposit was no longer safe, it was his duty to bring the facts to the attention of the court. \n5\n And at no time was Howard justified in maintaining a deposit not entirely secured by the depository bond if he had reasonable cause to doubt the stability of the bank.\n Fourth. The contention that the Bankruptcy Act established a depository system which relieved trustees and receivers wholly of the duty of exercising care as to the condition or stability of a depository rests upon false analogy. For federal public funds Congress has provided a depository system by which the moneys, as soon as deposited, are in effect in the Treasury of the United States. 31 U.S.C.  476-478, 495, 31 U.S.C. A.  476-478, 495; 12 U.S.C.  391, 392, 12 U.S.C.A.  391, 392. Under that system an officer who has duly made the deposits is relieved of all responsibility for the stability of the depository. Similar provision has been made in many states for the deposit of public funds of the state or municipality. \n6\n But the funds of bankruptcy estates are private funds, see Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Pottorff, \n291 \nU.S. 245\n. 257, note 11, 54 S.Ct. 416, 418, 419; and the provisions in the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 445, 454]\n\u00a0\n Bankruptcy Act concerning the appointment of depositories and the deposits to be made by trustees are of a very different character.\n As the exercise of ordinary care in making and maintaining deposits, even if made in a designated depository, was part of Howard's official duties, he and his surety are liable on the bonds if he failed in this respect. On that issue the evidence-particularly in view of the personal loans to him-was ample to justify submitting the question to the jury. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is, therefore, reversed; and the cause is remanded to it for consideration of the other errors which the defendants assigned concerning the conduct of the trial.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The condition of each bond given as trustee was: 'Now, therefore, if the said Sam Howard, Trustee as aforesaid, shall obey such orders as said Court may make in relation to said trust, and shall faithfully and truly account for all the moneys, assets and effects of the estate of said Bankrupt, which shall come into his hands and possession, and shall in all respects faithfully perform all his official duties as said Trustee, then this obligation to be void; otherwise, to remain in full force and virtue.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Receiver in Bankruptcy: In re Curtis, 2 Cir., 76 F.2d 751, 753; In re C.

They present the question of the constitutional validity of the Act of August 16, 1937, 50 Stat. 653, 11 U.S.C.A.  401-404, amending the Bankruptcy Act by adding chapter 10 providing for the composition of indebtedness of the taxing agencies or instrumentalities therein described. A certificate was issued to the Attorney General and the United States intervened. The District Court held the statute invalid as applied to the appellant and dismissed its petition for composition. The court considered itself bound by the decision in Ashton v. Cameron County District, \n298 \nU.S. 513\n, 56 S.Ct. 892, 896\n\n\n Appellant the Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District was organized in the year 1915 under the california Irrigation District Act of March 31, 1897, Stat.Cal. 1897, p. 254. It comprises about 15,260 acres in Tulare county. It is an irrigation district and taxing agency created for the purpose of constructing and operating irrigation projects and works devoted to the improvement of lands for \n\n[304 \nU.S. 27, 46]\n\u00a0\n agricultural purposes. On September 11, 1937, it presented its petition for the confirmation of a plan of composition. The petition alleged insolvency; that its indebtedness consisted of outstanding bonds aggregating $1,427,000 in principal, with unpaid interest of $439,085.15; that no interest or principal falling due since July 1, 1933, had been paid; that the low price of agricultural products had prevented the owners of land within the irrigation district from meeting their assessments; that upon the assessment levied by the District in the year 1932 there was a delinquency of 47 per cent. and that since that year there had been levied only an assessment of sufficient amount to maintain and operate its works; that the District's plan for the composition of its debts provided for the payment in cash of a sum equal to 59.978 cents for each dollar of the principal amount of its outstanding bonds in satisfaction of all amounts due; that creditors owning about 87 per cent. in the principal amount of the bonds had accepted the plan and consented to the filing of the petition; and that payment of the amount required was to be made from the proceeds of a loan which the Reconstruction Finance Corporation had agreed to make upon new refunding serial bonds equal to the amount borrowed and bearing interest at 4 per cent.\n The District Court approved the petition as filed in good faith and directed the creditors to show cause why an injunction should not issue staying the commencement of suits upon the securities affected by the plan. The appellees as bondholders appeared and moved to dismiss the petition upon the ground that chapter 10 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  401- 404, violated the Fifth and Tenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution. It appeared from the return to the order to show cause that these creditors had obtained an alternative writ of mandate from the state court directing the county board of supervisors to levy an assessment upon the lands within the District sufficient to pay \n\n[304 \nU.S. 27, 47]\n\u00a0\n the amounts due the complaining creditors, and that the proceedings in that court had been suspended pending the proceeding in the bankruptcy court.\n First. Chapter 10 of the Bankruptcy Act is limited to voluntary proceedings for the composition of debts. Aside from the question as to the power of the Congress to provide this method of relief for the described taxing agencies, it is well settled that a proceeding for composition is in its nature within the federal bankruptcy power. Compositions were authorized by the Bankruptcy Act of 1867,  43, 14 Stat. 538, as amended by the Act of 1874, c. 390,  17, 18 Stat. 182. It is unnecessary to the validity of such a proceeding that it should result in an adjudication of bankruptcy. In re Reiman, 20 Fed.Cas. 490, 496, 497, No. 11673; Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 648, 672\n, 673 S., 55 S.Ct. 595, 604, 605. In the Continental Bank Case, in the course of a full consideration of the scope of the federal bankruptcy power and of the evolution of its exercise, we said: 'The constitutionality of the old provision for a composition is not open to doubt. In re Reiman, 20 Fed.Cas. pages 490, 496, 497, No. 11673, cited with approval in Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, supra (\n186 \nU.S. 181\n, at page 187, 22 S.Ct. 857.) That provision was there sustained upon the broad ground that the 'subject of bankruptcies' was nothing less than 'the subject of the relations between an insolvent or nonpaying or fraudulent debtor, and his creditors, extending to his and their relief.' That it was not necessary for the proceedings to be carried through in bankruptcy was held not to warrant the objection that the provision did not constitute a law on the subject of bankruptcies.'\n Second. It is unnecessary to consider the question whether chapter 10 would be valid as applied to the irrigation district in the absence of the consent of the State which created it, for the State has given its consent. We think that this sufficiently appears from the statute of California enacted in 1934. St. of 1934, Ex.Sess., \n\n[304 \nU.S. 27, 48]\n\u00a0\n c. 4, p. 5. This statute (section 1) adopts the definition of 'taxing districts' as described in an amendment of the Bankruptcy Act, to wit chapter 9 approved May 24, 1934, 11 U.S.C.A.  301-303, and further provides that the Bankruptcy Act and 'acts amendatory and supplementary thereto, as the same may be amended from time to time, are herein referred to as the 'Federal Bankruptcy Statute.\" Chapter 10 of the Bankruptcy Act is an amendment and appears to be embraced within the state's definition. We have not been referred to any decision to the contrary. Section 3 of the state act then provides that any taxing district in the State is authorized to file the petition mentioned in the 'Federal Bankruptcy Statute.' Subsequent sections empower the taxing district upon the conditions stated to consummate a plan of readjustment in the event of its confirmation by the federal court. The statute concludes with a statement of the reasons for its passage, as follows: 'There exist throughout the State of California economic conditions which make it impossible for property owners to pay their taxes and special assessments levied upon real or taxable property. The burden of such taxes and special assessments is so onerous in amount that great delinquencies have occurred in the collection thereof and seriously affect the ability of taxing districts to obtain the revenue necessary to conduct governmental functions and to pay obligations represented by bonds. It is essential that financial relief, as set forth in this act, be immediately afforded to such taxing districts in order to avoid serious impairment of their taxing systems, with consequent crippling of the local governmental functions of the State. This act will aid in accomplishing this necessary result and should therefore go into effect immediately.' Section 13.\n While the facts thus stated related to conditions in California, similar conditions existed in other parts of the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 27, 49]\n\u00a0\n country and it was this serious situation which led the Congress to enact chapter 9 and later chapter 10.1\n Our attention has been called to the difference between section 80(k) of chapter 9 and section 83(i) of chapter 10 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S. C.A.  303(k), 403(i), in the omission from the latter of the provision requiring the approval of the petition by a governmental agency of the State whenever such approval is necessary by virtue of the local law. We attach no importance to this omission. It is immaterial, if the consent of the State is not required to make the federal plan effective, and it is equally immaterial if the consent of the State has been given, as we think it has in this case. It should also be observed that chapter 10, section 83(e), 11 U.S.C.A.  403(e), provides as a condition of confirmation of a plan of composition that it must appear that the petitioner 'is authorized by law to take all action necessary to be taken by it to carry out the plan,' and, if the judge is not satisfied on that point as well as on the others mentioned, he must enter an order dismissing the proceeding. The phrase 'authorized by law' manifestly refers to the law of the state.\n Third. We are thus brought to the inquiry whether the exercise of the federal bankruptcy power in dealing with a composition of the debts of the irrigation district, upon its voluntary application and with the State's consent, must be deemed to be an unconstitutional interference with the essential independence of the State as preserved by the Constitution.\n In Ashton v. Cameron County District, supra, the court considered that the provisions of chapter 9, 11 U.S.C.A.  301 et seq., authorizing \n\n[304 \nU.S. 27, 50]\n\u00a0\n the bankruptcy court to entertain proceedings for the 'readjustment of the debts' of 'political subdivisions' of a State 'might materially restrict ( its) control over its fiscal affairs,' and was therefore invalid; that if obligations of States or their political subdivisions might be subjected to the interference contemplated by chapter 9, they would no longer be 'free to manage their own affairs.'\n In enacting chapter 10 the Congress was especially solicitous to afford no ground for this objection. In the report of the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives,2 which was adopted by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,3 in dealing with the bill proposing to enact chapter 10, the subject was carefully considered. The Committee said:\n'Compositions are approvable only when the districts or agencies file voluntary proceedings in courts of bankruptcy accompanied by plans approved by 51 per cent of all the creditors of the district or agency, and by evidence of good faith. Each proceeding is subject to ample notice to creditors, thorough hearings, complete investigations, and appeals from interlocutory and final decrees. The plan of composition cannot be confirmed unless accepted in writing by creditors holding at least 66 2\/3 per cent of the aggregate amount of the indebtedness of the petitioning district or taxing agency, and unless the judge is satisfied that the taxing district is authorized by law to carry out the plan, and until a specific finding by the court that the plan of composition is fair, equitable, and for the best interests of the creditors. ...\n\n'The Committee on the Judiciary is not unmindful of the sweeping character of the holding of the Supreme Court above referred to (in the Ashton Case), and believes \n\n[304 \nU.S. 27, 51]\n\u00a0\n that H.R. 5969 is not invalid or contrary to the reasoning of the majority opinion. ...\n\n'The bill here recommended for passage expressly avoids any restriction on the powers of the States or their arms of government in the exercise of their sovereign rights and duties. No interference with the fiscal or governmental affairs of a political subdivision is permitted. The taxing agency itself is the only instrumentality which can seek the benefits of the proposed legislation. No involuntary proceedings are allowable, and no control or jurisdiction over that property and those revenues of the petitioning agency necessary for essential governmental purposes is conferred by the bill. ...\n\n'There is no hope for relief through statutes enacted by the States, because the Constitution forbids the passing of State laws impairing the obligations of existing contracts. Therefore, relief must come from Congress, if at all. The committee are not prepared to admit that the situation presents a legislative no-man's land. ... It is the opinion of the committee that the present bill removes the objections to the unconstitutional statute, and gives a forum to enable those distressed taxing agencies which desire to adjust their obligations and which are capable of reorganization, to meet their creditors under necessary judicial control and guidance and free from coercion, and to affect such adjustment on a plan determined to be mutually advantageous.'\n\n We are of the opinion that the Committee's points are well taken and that chapter 10 is a valid enactment. The statute is carefully drawn so as not to impinge upon the sovereignty of the State. The State retains control of its fiscal affairs. The bankruptcy power is exercised in relation to a matter normally within its province and only in a case where the action of the taxing agency in carrying out a plan of composition approved by the bankruptcy court is authorized by state law. It is of the es- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 27, 52]\n\u00a0\n sence of sovereignty to be able to make contracts and give consents bearing upon the exertion of governmental power. This is constantly illustrated in treaties and conventions in the international field by which governments yield their freedom of action in particular matters in order to gain the benefits which accrue from international accord. Oppenheim, International Law, 4th Ed., vol. 1,  493, 494; Hyde, International Law, vol. 2,  489; Perry v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 330, 353\n, 55 S.Ct. 432, 436, 95 A.L.R. 1335; Steward Machine Company v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 548, 597\n, 57 S.Ct. 883, 895, 109 A.L.R. 1293. The reservation to the States by the Tenth Amendment protected, and did not destroy, their right to make contracts and give consents where that action would not contravene the provisions of the Federal Constitution. The States with the consent of Congress may enter into compacts with each other and the provisions of such compacts may limit the agreeing States in the exercise of their respective powers. Const. art. 1,  10, cl. 3; Poole v. Fleeger, 11 Pet. 185, 209; Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 725; Hinderlider v. La Plata River Company, \n304 \nU.S. 92\n, 58 S.Ct. 803, 82 L.Ed . --. The State is free to make contracts with individuals and give consents upon which the other contracting party may rely with respect to a particular use of governmental authority. See Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 137; New Jersey v. Wilson, 7 Cranch 164; Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 643, 644; Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 549; Jefferson Branch Bank v. Skelly, 1 Black 436, 446. While the instrumentalities of the national government are immune from taxation by a State, the State may tax them if the national government consents ( Baltimore National Bank v. State Tax Commission, \n297 \nU.S. 209, 211\n, 212 S., 56 S.Ct. 417, 418) and by a parity of reasoning the consent of the State could remove the obstacle to the taxation by the federal government of state agencies to which the consent applied. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 27, 53]\n\u00a0\n Nor did the formation of an indestructible Union of indestructible States make impossible cooperation between the Nation and the States through the exercise of the power of each to the advantage of the people who are citizens of both. We had recent occasion to consider that question in the case of Steward Machine Company v. Davis, supra, in relation to the operation of the Social Security Act of August 14, 1935, 49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C.A.  301-1305. The question was raised with special emphasis in relation to section 904 of the statute, 42 U.S.C.A.  1104, and the parts of section 903, 42 U.S.C.A.  1103, complementary thereto, by which the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to receive and hold in the Unemployment Trust Fund all moneys deposited therein by a state agency for a state unemployment fund and to invest in obligations of the United States such portion of the Fund as is not in his judgment required to meet current withdrawals. The contention was that Alabama in consenting to that deposit had 'renounced the plenitude of power inherent in her statehood.' \n301 \nU.S. 548\n, at pages 595, 596, 57 S.Ct. 883, 895. We found the contention to be unsound. As the States were at liberty upon obtaining the consent of Congress to make agreements with one another, we saw no room for doubt that they may do the like with Congress if the essence of their statehood is maintained without impairment. And we added that: 'Nowhere in our scheme of government-in the limitations express or implied of our Federal Constitution-do we find that she (the State) is prohibited from assenting to conditions that will assure a fair and just requital for benefits received.'\n In the instant case we have co-operation to provide a remedy for a serious condition in which the States alone were unable to afford relief. Improvement districts, such as the petitioner, were in distress. Economic disaster had made it impossible for them to meet their obligations. As the owners of property within the boundaries of the district could not pay adequate assessments, the power of \n\n[304 \nU.S. 27, 54]\n\u00a0\n taxation was useless. The creditors of the district were helpless. The natural and reasonable remedy through composition of the debts of the district was not available under state law by reason of the restriction imposed by the Federal Constitution upon the impairment of contracts by state legislation. The bankruptcy power is competent to give relief to debtors in such a plight and, if there is any obstacle to its exercise in the case of the districts organized under state law it lies in the right of the State to oppose federal interference. The State steps in to remove that obstacle. The State acts in aid, and not in derogation, of its sovereign powers. It invites the intervention of the bankruptcy power to save its agency which the State itself is powerless to rescue. Through its cooperation with the national government the needed relief is given. We see no ground for the conclusion that the Federal Constitution, in the interest of state sovereignty, has reduced both sovereigns to helplessness in such a case.\n Fourth. As the bankruptcy power may be exerted to give effect to a plan for the composition of the debts of an insolvent debtor, we find no merit in appellant's objections under the Fifth Amendment. In re Reiman, supra; Continental National Bank v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific R. Co., supra.\n The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of the opinion that the principle approved in Ashton v.

Carroll, of Boston, Mess., for respondents. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 623, 624]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Can the United States enforce a contract executed by an ex-soldier in order to obtain admission into the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, which contract provides that upon the death of the veteran while a member of the Home, all his personal property shall pass to the Home subject to be reclaimed within five years by any legatee or person entitled to receive the property by inheritance?\n The District Court held the contract valid and enforceable. \n1\n The Court of Appeals reversed. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The facts disclose that:\n Thomas McGovern, a native of Ireland, served in the United States Army from 1877 to 1882; in 1904 his wife and three daughters left him, but a son, Robert, continued to live with McGovern until 1918 when the son ( represented in this cause by a guardian) was committed to a state home for the insane; the complete severance of all family ties and associations continued until McGovern's death, and the wife and daughters, living most of the time in Boston, Mass., where wholly unaware of his whereabouts for the last twenty years of his life, most of which were spent in nearby Chelsea; under these circumstances, McGovern, age 72, in his application for admission to the Home, stated that the names and addresses of his wife and nearest relatives were unknown, and that he desired admission because he was 'unable on account of his disability to earn his living'; a doctor's certificate showed that his mental condition was good, at the date of admission, but that he needed medical treatment and attention due to serious physical weakness and ailments. His written agreement with the Home stated: \n\n[302 \nU.S. 623, 625]\n\u00a0\n 'The said Thomas McGovern hereby agrees that, in event of his death while a member of the National Military Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, leaving no heirs at law or next of kin, all personal property owned by him at the time of his death, including money or choses in action held by him and not disposed of by will, whether such property be the proceeds of pensions or otherwise derived, shall vest in and become the property of said Board of Managers for the sole use and benefit of the post fund of said home, and that all personal property of the said Thomas McGovern shall upon his death, while a member, at once pass to and vest in said Board of Managers, subject to be reclaimed by any legatee or person entitled to take the same by inheritance at any time within five years after the death of such member. ...'\n At the time of his admission into the Home, McGovern had savings deposits which were his personal property. September 17, 1928, while an inmate of the Home, he died intestate. His wife died in 1933 without knowledge of his death, and none of the daughters learned of his death until October 19, 1935. No claim to McGovern's property was filed with the Home within five years after his death.\n In this action brought by the United States to require payment to the Home of funds of McGovern on deposit in a Massachusetts bank at his death, it is contended:\n\n\n (1)\n That, because McGovern left surviving heirs, the title to his personal property did not pass to the Home;\n\n\n (2)\n That the Act of June 25, 19103 authorizing the Home to make the contract with McGovern is invalid. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 623, 626]\n\u00a0\n 1. There is no ambiguity in the contract or in the act which authorized it. No words in the contract indicate that the personal property should pass to the Home only in the absence of persons entitled to take by law. On the contrary, both the contract and the act evince a clear intent that the personal property of the veteran, when not claimed by heirs or legatees within five years after the veteran's death, should pass to the Home to be used to provide comforts and entertainment for its inmates. 'The measure (the Act of 1910) leaves the member free to dispose by will and safeguards to the legatees and heirs the right within five years to reclaim all the property that belonged to him at the time of his death. As to that, there is no ambiguity and therefore nothing to construe.' National Home v. Wood, \n299 \nU.S. 211, 216\n, 57 S.Ct. 137, 139.\n\n 2. \nThe Court of Appeals was of the opinion that the act of Congress authorizing the contract was void as an interference with the reserved rights of the state of the veteran's legal domicile when he died ( Massachusetts) \n\n[302 \nU.S. 623, 627]\n\u00a0\n in that 'it was at most but an attempt to make a future testamentary disposition of McGovern's property, when such a disposition could only be effected by will.'\n This contract, however, is valid under the applicable state law. \n4\n The Supreme Court of Massachusetts in 1931 in the case of Hale v. Wilmarth, 274 Mass. 186, 189, 174 N.E. 232, 234, 73 A.L.R. 980, said, 'The statute of wills ... does not prevent an owner of property from stipulating by contract for the disposition of his property at the time of his death.' \n5\n\u00a0\n\n During the life of the veteran, his property was his own to dispose of as he desired; his was an 'intent to make a more binding and irrevocable provision than a legacy could be'6 and a stipulation for notice to his heirs of the fact of his death was not required to make the provision valid. 'Not until the ancestor dies is there any vested right in the heir.' Jefferson v. Fink, \n247 \nU.S. 288, 294\n, 38 S.Ct. 516, 518\n\n\n In passing the Act of June, 1910, Congress merely directed the terms and conditions under which veterans, consistently with state law, can obtain admittance to Homes built, maintained, and operated by the government for the benefit of veterans. Homes for the aged, needy, or infirm, in return for the benefits bestowed by them, generally receive some benefit from any property or estates of their members. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[302 \nU.S. 623, 628]\n\u00a0\n When McGovern entered this home, he was aged, without family ties, lonely, and physically incapacitated. There he received care, food, shelter, and companionship. He would have been privileged to remain in the Home even though, after admittance, he had chosen to make the members of his family the recipients of the money, by gift, by will, or by notifying them to claim his property after his death.\n The claim of the government is based on a contract between the veteran and the Home. Nothing in the record indicates that the agreement was not fairly and voluntarily entered into between the parties, or that it was inequitable, unjust, or not upon valuable consideration. Both parties were competent to make the contract. This contract is valid and enforceable, and since no claim was made by heirs or legatees within five years after his death, the veteran's personal property passed to the Home for the benefit of its inmates. The decree of the Court of Appeals is not in harmony with these views and is reversed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States v.

Cummings, Atty. Gen., and \n\n[303 \nU.S. 226, 227]\n\u00a0\n Edward M. Reidy, of Washington, D.C., for appellants.\n Mr. Moultrie Hitt, of Washington, D.C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The sole questions requiring decision is one of statutory construction: The Railway Mail Pay Act of July 28, 1916, c. 261,  5, 39 Stat. 412, 425-430, 39 U.S.C.A.  551, provides that the Interstate Commerce Commission 'shall establish by order a fair, reasonable rate or compensation to be received' by railroads for carrying the mail;1 and authorizes the Commission to modify the order upon a 're-examination.' The Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219, 220, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(28) (amending Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539) declares that district courts shall have jurisdiction 'of cases brought to enjoin, set \n\n[303 \nU.S. 226, 228]\n\u00a0\n aside, annul, or suspend in whole or in part any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.' May suit be brought under the Urgent Deficiencies Act to set aside an order refusing, upon 're-examination,' to increase the allowance for railway mail compensation theretofore made to this carrier?\n The suit was brought, under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, in the federal court for Southern Georgia, by the receivers of the Georgia & Florida Railroad against the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission, to set aside an order made May 10, 1933, under the Railway Mail Pay Act, Railway Mail Pay, Georgia & Florida R.R., 192 I.C.C. 779; and to grant a permanent injunction. By that order the Commission had denied upon a 're-examination' an application further to increase the compensation allowed by the order of July 10, 1928. Railway Mail Pay, 144 I.C.C. 675. The 1928 order had, upon a 're-examination,' increased the compensation originally fixed by order of December 23, 1919. Railway-Mail Pay, 56 I.C.C. 1. As grounds for setting aside the order of May 10, 1933, the receivers alleged, among other things, that the order was unlawful, because the finding that the existing rates were fair and reasonable was without evidence to support it and contrary to the evidence and that the order will violate the Fifth Amendment by taking property without just compensation.\n The jurisdiction of the court was not challenged; and the case was heard by three judges on the merits. A decree was rendered setting aside as unlawful the order of May 10, 1933, and directing the Commission to take further action. Additional hearings were then had by the Commission; and on February 4, 1936, it again declined to order any increase over that which had been allowed July 10, 1928. Railway Mail Pay, Georgia & Florida R.R., 214 I.C.C. 66. The last order of the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 226, 229]\n\u00a0\n Commission was assailed by a supplemental bill on the same grounds as that assailed in the original bill. The jurisdiction of the court was not challenged; the case was again heard on the merits by three judges; and a decree was entered setting aside the order of February 4, 1936, and directing the Commission to take 'such further action in the premises as the law requires in view of the annulment and setting aside of' the order.\n From that decree the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission have appealed to this Court. Here, although answering to the merits, they challenged the jurisdiction of the District Court. Since lack of jurisdiction of a federal court touching the subject matter of the litigation cannot be waived by the parties, we must upon this appeal examine the contention; and, if we conclude that the District Court lacked jurisdiction of the cause, direct that the bill be dismissed. United States v. Corrick, \n298 \nU.S. 435, 440\n, 56 S.Ct. 829, 831. We at first thought that the District Court had jurisdiction, and ordered a reargument of the case on the merits. But, upon further consideration of the jurisdictional question, we are of opinion that the remedy provided by the Urgent Deficiencies Act is not applicable to this order.\n First. The Railway Mail Pay Act, terminated the system theretofore prevailing of service under voluntary contracts. \n2\n As embodied in United States Code, title 39, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 226, 230]\n\u00a0\n 523 to 568, 39 U.S.C.A.  523-568, it provides in forty-six sections comprehensively for the character, means and methods of mail transportation; defines the authority of the Postmaster General; and describes the obligations of the railroads and their right to compensation, which is to be fixed by the Commission.\n'The Interstate Commerce Commission is hereby empowered and directed to fix and determine from time to time the fair and reasonable rates and compensation for the transportation of such mail matter by railway common carriers and the service connected therewith, prescribing the method or methods by weight, or space, or both, or otherwise, for ascertaining such rate or compensation, and to publish the same, and orders so made and published shall continue in force until changed by the commission after due notice and hearing.' 39 U.S.C.  542, 39 U.S.C.A.  542.\n\n'For the purpose of determining and fixing rates or compensation hereunder the commission is authorized to make such classification of carriers as may be just and reasonable and, where just and equitable, fix general rates applicable to all carriers in the same classification.' 39 U. S.C.  549, 39 U.S.C.A.  549.\n\n'At the conclusion of the hearing the commission shall establish by order a fair, reasonable rate or compensation to be received, at such stated times as may be named in the order, for the transportation of mail matter and the service connected therewith, and during the continuance of the order the Postmaster General shall pay the carrier \n\n[303 \nU.S. 226, 231]\n\u00a0\n from the appropriation for inland transportation by railroad routes such rate or compensation.' 39 U.S.C.  551, 39 U.S.C.A.  551.\n\n Eleven sections of the act deal with the procedure on hearings before the Commission. \n3\n No provision is made for a judicial review. But provision is made for administrative review by 're-examination' of an order.\n'Either the Postmaster General or any such carrier may at any time after the lapse of six months from the entry of the order assailed apply for a re-examination and thereupon substantially similar proceedings shall be had with respect to the rate or rates for service covered by said application, provided said carrier or carriers have an interest therein.' 39 U.S.C.  553, 39 U.S.C.A.  553.\n\n There have been many administrative reviews by 're-examination.' \n4\n The case at bar appears to be the only \n\n[303 \nU.S. 226, 232]\n\u00a0\n instance in which an attempt has been made to set aside a mail order by suit under the Urgent Deficiencies Act.\n Second. The Urgent Deficiencies Act provides a method of judicial review of orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission possessing the following extraordinary features: (1) The original hearing in the district court is not before a single judge, but before three, of whom one must be a circuit judge; (2) from the decree of the district court as so constituted a direct appeal to the Supreme Court is granted as of right, instead of a review by a circuit court of appeals; (3) upon both the trial court and the Supreme Court rests the obligation to give the case precedence over others. These features were first introduced by the Expediting Act of 1903, 32 Stat. 823, 15 U.S.C.A.  28, 29 and notes for suits by the United States to enforce the antitrust and commerce laws. They were extended by the Hepburn Act of 1906,  5, 34 Stat. 584, 590, 592, 49 U.S.C.A.  16 and note, to suits to enforce or to set aside orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission. When that jurisdiction was vested in the Commerce Court provisions with like effect were pro- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 226, 233]\n\u00a0\n vided for cases coming before it. 36 Stat. 539. To its jurisdiction the district court succeeded, with these features, under the Urgent Deficiencies Act.\n In the opinion of Congress jurisdiction with the extraordinary features of the Urgent Deficiencies Act was justified by the character of the cases to which it applied-cases of public importance because of the widespread effect of the decisions thereof. In such cases Congress sought to guard against ill-considered action by a single judge and to avert the delays ordinarily incident to litigation. In construing the Act, this Court concluded that despite the broad language used in the Commerce Court Act, Congress could not have intended to include in this special jurisdiction suits to set aside every kind of order issued by the Commission. For substantially every decision, and every other kind of action by the Commission is expressed in, or is followed by, an order; and many of the orders are obviously not of such public importance and wide- spread effect as to justify, in cases affecting them, the extraordinary features of the Urgent Deficiencies Act.\n The Commerce Court had (36 Stat. 539) jurisdiction 'over all cases of the following kinds:\n'First. All cases for the enforcement, otherwise than by adjudication and collection of a forfeiture or penalty or by infliction of criminal punishment, of any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission other than for the payment of money.\n\n'Second. Cases brought to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend in whole or in part any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.'\n\n This Court concluded that, as the intent of Congress was 'to relieve parties in whole or in part from the duty of obedience to orders which are found to be illegal,' there was jurisdiction to set aside only those kinds of orders which there was jurisdiction to enforce; that a distinction must be drawn between 'affirmative' and 'negative' \n\n[303 \nU.S. 226, 234]\n\u00a0\n orders; and that jurisdiction under the Commerce Court Act was applicable only to 'affirmative' orders. Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 282\n, 32 S.Ct. 761; Hooker v. Knapp, \n225 \nU.S. 302\n, 32 S. Ct. 769. Since the abolition of the Commerce Court, that rule has been consistently followed in cases brought under the Urgent Deficiencies Act. Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 412\n, 37 S.Ct. 397; Piedmont & Northern Ry. v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 469\n, 50 S.Ct. 192; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 235\n, 51 S.Ct. 429; United States v. Corrick, \n298 \nU.S. 435\n, 56 S.Ct. 829. Compare Delaware & Hudson Co. v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 438\n, 45 S.Ct. 153; United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. Co., \n273 \nU.S. 299\n, 47 S.Ct. 413.\n The order of February 4, 1936, here assailed, does not command either the Government or the Railroad to do anything. It is simply a refusal, upon a second 're-examination' of the order of July 11, 1928, further to increase the compensation thereby awarded upon a 're-examination' of the compensation originally awarded by the order made December 23, 1919. The order assailed, being a refusal to change the existing status, was a 'negative' order. The District Court lacked jurisdiction to set it aside, and should have dismissed the bill.\n Third. Congress cannot be assumed to have made the extraordinary remedy of the Urgent Deficiencies Act applicable for the determination of the validity of railway mail pay orders, even if 'affirmative.' The issue here is whether the existing mail revenue of $35,728 should be increased for the year by $31,227. There is no wide public interest in its speedy determination. There is no danger of temporarily interrupting the mail service through the improvident issue of an injunction by a single judge. Only the method or amount of payments currently to be made would be affected. Such orders are in character unlike those under the Boiler Inspection Act, 36 Stat. 913, as amended, 38 Stat. 1192, 43 Stat. 659, 45 U.S.C.A.  22 et seq. and the Inland Waterways Corporation Act, 43 Stat. 361, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 226, 235]\n\u00a0\n as amended, 45 Stat. 978, 48 Stat. 968, 49 U.S.C.A.  153, of which jurisdiction was taken although the statutes contained no provision for judicial review. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n In Great Northern Ry. Co. v. United States, 277 U.S, 172, 48 S.Ct. 466, we held that there was not jurisdiction under the Urgent Deficiencies Act of a suit to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission made under title 2 of the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 457, determining the amount due a railroad on the Government's guaranty of income for the period following relinquishment of federal control. And in United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. Co., \n273 \nU.S. 299\n, 47 S.Ct. 413, we held that there was not jurisdiction under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, 28 U.S.C.A.  43-48, 214, of a suit to set aside a final order under the Valuation Act, even though that statute was enacted as an amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act itself. 37 Stat. 701, as amended, 41 Stat. 456, 474, 493, 42 Stat. 624, 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n In recent years the field of administrative determination has been widely extended; and the duty of making many of these determinations has been imposed upon the Interstate Commerce Commission. \n7\n Some of the statutes contain specific provision making applicable ju- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 226, 236]\n\u00a0\n risdiction under the Urgent Deficiencies Act. This is true of the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 211, 216, as amended, 49 Stat. 376, 49 U.S.C.A.  264a, 267a, and of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 543, 550, 49 U.S.C.A.  305(h). Compare Transportation of Explosives Act (Criminal Code,  233), 35 Stat. 554, 555, as amended, 35 Stat. 1088, 1135, 41 Stat. 1445, 18 U.S.C.A.  383. It is true likewise of several statutes under which the determinations are to be made by other administrative tribunals. Shipping Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 728, 738, superseded by 49 Stat. 1985, 46 U.S.C.A.  1101 et seq. (United States Shipping Board); Packers & Stockyards Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 159, 168, 7 U.S.C.A.  221 et seq. (Secretary of Agriculture); Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930, 46 Stat. 531, 535, 46 U.S.C.A  499g et seq. (Secretary of Agriculture); Emergency Railroad Transportation Act of 1933, supra (Federal Coordinator of Transportation); Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, 1093, as amended, 50 Stat. 189, 47 U.S.C.A.  151 ( Federal \n\n[303 \nU.S. 226, 237]\n\u00a0\n Communications Commission.)8 The orders for which review is provided by each of these statutes are like the orders under the Interstate Commerce Act fixing rates payable by shippers. Improper injunctive relief of such orders or delay in final determination of their validity may seriously affect the public interest by preventing or obstructing action under those statutes.\n While the compensation fixed in a railway mail pay order is ordinarily measured by a rate, the ultimate question determined by the Commission is, as in the Great Northern Case, the proper compensation to be paid by the Government to the railroad for services and the use of its property-the quantum meruit for carrying the mail. There is nothing in the history of the Railway Mail Pay Act which requires that the Urgent Deficiencies Act be made applicable to the determination of the validity of such orders. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 226, 238]\n\u00a0\n Fourth. The absence in the Railway Mail Pay Act of a provision for judicial review and the denial of jurisdiction under the Urgent Deficiencies Act do not preclude every character of judicial review. If the Commission makes the appropriate finding of reasonable compensation but fails, because of an alleged error of law, to order payment of the full amount which the railroad believes is payable under the finding, the Court of Claims has jurisdiction of an action for the balance, as the claim asserted is one founded upon a law of Congress. Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 603\n, 46 S.Ct. 598. Compare United States v. New York Central R. Co., \n279 \nU.S. 73\n, 49 S.Ct. 260, affirming 65 Ct.Cl. 115, 121.10 And since railway mail service is compulsory, the Court of Claims would, under the general provisions of the Tucker Act, 24 Stat. 505, have jurisdiction also of an action for additional compensation if an order is confiscatory. United States v. Great Falls Mfg. Co., \n112 \nU.S. 645\n, 5 S.Ct. 306; North American Transportation & Trading Co. v. United States, \n253 \nU.S. 330, 333\n, 40 S.Ct. 518; Jacobs v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 13, 16\n, 54 S. Ct. 26, 96 A.L.R. 1. Moreover, as district courts have jurisdiction of every suit at law or in equity 'arising under the postal laws,' 28 U.S.C.,  41(6), 28 U.S.C.A.  41(6) suit would lie under their general jurisdiction if the Commission is alleged to have acted in excess of its authority, or otherwise illegally. Compare Powell v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 276, 288\n, 289 S., 57 S.Ct. 470. But a suit under the Urgent Deficiencies Act to set aside an order concerning mail pay is not primarily one against the Commission. Primarily, it is a suit against the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 226, 239]\n\u00a0\n United States. \n11\n And the United States can be sued only when authority so to do has been specifically conferred. The Railway Mail Pay Act does not confer that authority.\n Decree reversed, with direction to the District Court to dismiss the bill without costs to either party.\n Mr. Justice BLACK agrees with the result and fully with all of the opinion except paragraph Fourth.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'The Postmaster General is authorized and directed to adjust the compensation to be paid to railroad companies for the transportation and handling of the mails and furnishing facilities and services in connection therewith upon the conditions and the rates hereinafter provided.' 39 U.S. C.  524, 39 U.S.C.A.  524.\n'All railway common carriers are hereby required to transport such mail matter as may be offered for transportation by the United States in the manner, under the conditions, and with the service prescribed by the Postmaster General and shall be entitled to receive fair and reasonable compensation for such transportation and for the service connected therewith.' 39 U.S.C.  541, 39 U.S.C.A.  541. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Prior to the Act of 1916, the carriage of mail by railroads-with the exception of some aided by land grant-was held to be not compulsory 'at adequate compensation to be judicially determined,' Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. v.

HENDLER(1938)\nNo. 563\nArgued: March 9, 1938Decided: March 28, 1938\n\n\n\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for the United States. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 564, 565]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. R. Semans and Randolph Barton, Jr., both of Baltimore, Md ., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the court.\n The Revenue Act of 19281 imposed a tax upon the annual 'net income' of corporations. It defined 'net income' as 'gross income ... less the deductions allowed,' and 'gross income' as including 'gains, profits, and income derived from ... trades ... or sales, or dealings in property , ... or gains or profits and income ... from any source whatever.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Section 112 of the Act3 exempts certain gains which are realized from a 'reorganization' similar to, or in the nature of, a corporate merger or consolidation. Under this section, such gains are not taxed if one corporation, pursuant to a 'plan of reorganization' exchanges its property 'solely for stock or securities in another corporation a party to the reorganization.' But, when a corporation not only receives 'stock or securities' in exchange for its property, but also receives 'other property or money' in carrying out a 'plan of reorganization,'\n'(1) If the corporation receiving such other property or money distributes it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, no gain to the corporation shall be recognized from the exchange, but\n\n'(2) If the corporation receiving such other property or money does not distribute it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, the gain, if any, to the corporation shall be recognized (taxed).'\n\n In this case, there was a merger or 'reorganization' of the Borden Company and the Hendler Creamery Company, Inc., resulting in gains of more than $6,000,000 to the Hendler Company, Inc., a corporation of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 564, 566]\n\u00a0\n which respondent is transferee. The Court of Appeals, believing there was an exemption under section 112, affirmed4 the judgment of the District Court5 holding all Hendler gains nontaxable.\n This controversy between the government and respondent involves the assumption and payment-pursuant to the plan of reorganization-by the Borden Company of $534,297.40 bonded indebtedness of the Hendler Creamery Company, Inc. We are unable to agree with the conclusion reached by the courts below that the gain to the Hendler Company, realized by the Borden Company's payment, was exempt from taxation under section 112.\n It was contended below and it is urged here that since the Hendler Company did not actually receive the money with which the Borden Company discharged the former's indebtedness, the Hendler Company's gain of $534, 297.40 is not taxable. The transaction, however, under which the Borden Company assumed and paid the debt and obligation of the Hendler Company is to be regarded in substance as though the $534,297.40 had been paid directly to the Hendler Company. The Hendler Company was the beneficiary of the discharge of its indebtedness. Its gain was as real and substantial as if the money had been paid it and then paid over by it to its creditors. The discharge of liability by the payment of the Hendler Company's indebtedness constituted income to the Hendler Company and is to be treated as such. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Section 112, 26 U.S.C.A.  112 and note, provides no exemption for gains-resulting from corporate 'reorganization'-neither received as 'stock or securities,' nor received as 'money or other property' and distributed to stockholders under the plan of reorganization. In Minnesota Tea Co. v. Helvering, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 564, 567]\n\u00a0\n \n302 \nU.S. 609\n, 58 S.Ct. 393, 394, it was said that this exemption 'contemplates a distribution to stockholders, and not payment to creditors.' The very statute upon which the taxpayer relies provides that 'If the corporation receiving such other property or money does not distribute it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, the gain, if any, to the corporation shall be recognized (taxed).'\n Since this gain or income of $534,297.40 of the Hendler Company was neither received as 'stock or securities' nor distributed to its stockholders 'in pursuance of the plan of reorganization' it was not exempt and is taxable gain as defined in the 1928 act. This $534,297.40 gain to the taxpayer does not fall within the exemptions of section 112, and the judgment of the court below is reversed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 797,  13, 26 U.S.C.A.  13 and note. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Id., sections 21, 22, 26 U.S.C.A.  21, 22, and notes. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Id., section 112, 26 U.S.C.A.  112 and note. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 4 Cir., 91 F.2d 680, certiorari granted, \n302 \nU.S. 680\n, 58 S.Ct. 284, 82 L.Ed. --. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] 17 F.Supp. 558. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Old Colony Trust Co. v.

Gen., and Gordon Dean, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. Selim B. Lemle, of New Orleans, La., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner brought this suit in the federal court for Eastern Louisiana to recover from respondent a penalty for violation of the Act of June 29, 1906, 34 Stat. 607, 45 U.S.C.  71-74, 45 U.S.C.A.  71-74. Upon an agreed statement, the court found the facts, stated its conclusions of law, and gave judgment for respondent. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 5 Cir., 90 F.2d 213. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n302 \nU.S. 671\n, 58 S.Ct. 49, 82 L.Ed. --.\n The question for decision is whether, as a matter of law, the facts found show conclusively that respondent knowingly and willfully failed to comply with the requirements of the first section of the Act, 45 U.S.C.A.  71.\n It declares that no carrier whose road forms a part of a line over which cattle shall be conveyed from one State to another shall confine the same in cars for longer than 28 consecutive hours without unloading them into properly equipped pens for rest, water, and feeding unless pre- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 239, 241]\n\u00a0\n vented by storm or by other accidental and unavoidable causes which cannot be anticipated or avoided by the exercise of due diligence and foresight; upon the written request of the owner the time of confinement may be extended to 36 hours. Section 2, 45 U.S.C.A.  72, requires that animals so unloaded shall be properly fed and watered. Section 3, 45 U.S.C.A.  73, provides: 'Any railroad ... who knowingly and willfully fails to comply with the provisions of the two preceding sections shall for every such failure be liable for and forfeit and pay a penalty of not less than $100 nor more than $500' recoverable by civil action in the name of the United States. Section 4, 45 U.S.C.A.  74.\n The petition alleged that respondent knowingly and willfully confined cattle in a car for 37 hours without unloading them. The answer admitted that the cattle were continuously confined in the car from three o'clock in the afternoon of October 8, 1932, when loaded at point of shipment, Hermanville, Mississippi, until four o'clock of the morning of October 10 when unloaded at destination, New Orleans, Louisiana, but directly put in issue the allegation that respondent knowingly and willfully so confined the cattle. It alleged that the car arrived at New Orleans at 11:35 in the evening of October 9; that having received advance information of the approximate time of arrival and of the time when the 36-hour period would expire, respondent's yardmaster, in order promptly to handle the shipment, procured an extra engine and crew immediately upon arrival of the car to take it to the stockyards and, before the expiration of the permissible time of confinement, there place it for unloading; that the yardmaster negligently failed to notify the enployee, whose duty it was to unload; and because of his oversight and negligence the cattle were continuously confined in the car for 37 hours.\n A motion by petitioner for judgment on the pleadings having been overruled, the parties waived trial by jury and stipulated evidentiary facts in substance as alleged \n\n[303 \nU.S. 239, 242]\n\u00a0\n in the answer. They left open the question whether respondent knowingly and willfully confined the cattle for more than 36 hours. The case was submitted for decision on the agreed statement without more. The court found evidentiary facts in accordance with the stipulation, held failure to unload within the time was due to the negligence of the yardmaster, and concluded that respondent did not knowingly and willfully fail to comply with the statute.\n The case depends upon the meaning of the phrase 'knowingly and willfully,' used in section 3, 45 U.S.C.A.  73, to characterize the transgressions for which penalties are imposed. The Act is to be construed to give effect to its humanitarian provisions, and as well to the exceptions in favor of the carriers. Chicago & N.W. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 512, 517\n, 518 S., 38 S.Ct. 351. 'The penalty is not imposed for unwitting failure to comply with the statute. United States v. Sioux City Stock Yards Co., C.C., 162 F. 556, 562; United States v. Stockyards Terminal Ry. Co., 8 Cir., 178 F. 19, 23; St. Joseph Stockyards Co. v. United States, 8 Cir., 187 F. 104; Oregon-Washington R. & Nav. Co. v. United States, 9 Cir., 205 F. 341, 343. But in this case, the respondent knew when the permissible period of confinement would expire, brought the car to destination, and within the time allowed, placed it for unloading. By allowing the 36 hours to expire, it 'knowingly' failed to comply with the statute.\n Mere omission with knowledge of the facts is not enough. The penalty may not be recovered unless the carrier is also shown 'willfully' to have failed. In statutes denouncing offenses involving turpitude, 'willfully' is generally used to mean with evil purpose, criminal intent or the like. But in those denouncing acts not in themselves wrong, the word is often used without any such implication. Our opinion in United States v. Murdock, \n290 \nU.S. 389, 394\n, 54 S.Ct. 223, 225, shows that it often denotes that \n\n[303 \nU.S. 239, 243]\n\u00a0\n which is 'intentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental,' and that it is employed to characterize 'conduct marked by careless disregard whether or not one has the right so to act.' The significance of the word 'willfully' as used in section 3, 45 U.S.C.A.  73, now before us, was carefully considered by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St. Louis & S.F.R. Co. v. United States, 169 F. 69. Speaking through Circuit Judge Van Devanter, now Mr. Justice Van Devanter, the court said (page 71): \"Willfully' means something not expressed by 'knowingly,' else both would not be used conjunctively. ... But it does not mean with intent to injure the cattle or to inflict loss upon their owner because such intent on the part of a carrier is hardly within the pale of actual experience or reasonable supposition. ... So, giving effect to these considerations, we are persuaded that it means purposely or obstinately and is designed to describe the attitude of a carrier, who, having a free will or choice, eithr intentionally disregards the statute or is plainly indifferent to its requirements.' That statement has been found a useful guide to the meaning of the word 'willfully' and to its right application in suits for penalties under section 3. United States v. Stockyards Terminal Ry. Co., supra, 178 F. 19, 23; St. Joseph Stockyards Co. v. United States, supra, 187 F. 104, 105; Oregon-Washington R. & Nav. Co. v. United States, 9 Cir., 205 F. 337, 339; St. Louis Merchants' Bridge T. Ry. Co. v. United States, 7 Cir., 209 F. 600. See, also, Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co. v. United States, 8 Cir., 194 F. 342, 346; United States v. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co., 8 Cir., 202 F. 828, 833.\n Considered as unaffected by the yardmaster's negligence, respondent's failure to take the cattle from the car already placed at the yard for unloading, unquestionably discloses disregard of the statute and indifference to its requirements and compels the conclusion that, within the meaning of section 3, 45 U.S.C.A.  73, respondent willfully violated its duty \n\n[303 \nU.S. 239, 244]\n\u00a0\n to unload as required by section 1, 45 U.S.C.A.  71. It is immaterial whether the yardmaster's negligence or oversight was intentional or excusable. As between the government and respondent, the latter's breach is precisely the same in kind and degree as it would have been if its yardmaster's failure had been intentional instead of merely negligent. The duty violated did not arise out of the relation of employer and employee but was one that, in virtue of the statute, was owed by respondent to the shippers and the public. As respondent could act only through employees, it is responsible for their failure. To hold carriers not liable for penalties where the violations of sections 1 and 2, 45 U.S.C.A.  71, 72, are due to mere indifference, inadvertence, or negligence of employees would defeat the purpose of section 3. Whether respondent knowingly and willfully failed is to be determined by the acts and omissions which characterize its violation of the statute and not upon any breach of duty owed to it by its employees. Respondent's contention that it is not liable because its failure was due to the negligence or oversight of the yardmaster cannot be sustained. Montana Cent. Ry. Co. v.

Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Daniel W. Knowlton, of Washington, D.C., for appellants.\n Messrs. Luther M. Walter and John S.

They resulted from a general report in which the Commission after investigation announced general conclusions respecting switching services by carriers in industrial plants, and payment of allowances out of the line-haul rate to an industry performing the service,2 and subsequent supplemental reports with respect to specific plants. \n3\n The Commission held that, in the circumstances disclosed at each of the plants under consideration, the carriers' obligation of delivery was fulfilled by placing or receiving cars on interchange tracks and that the moving and spotting of cars in the industries' plants formed no part of the service covered by the line-haul rate. It concluded that the prac- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 156, 158]\n\u00a0\n tice of making an allowance out of the rate to the owner of the plant for the peformance of the spotting service was unlawful and should be discontinued.\n The appellees, in their complaints, asserted that in making its orders the Commission exceeded the powers conferred upon it by the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq. These contentions are the same as those considered in United States v. American Sheet & Tin Plate Co ., \n301 \nU.S. 402\n, 57 S.Ct. 804, and are foreclosed by the decision therein.\n The appellees charged that the Commission's findings and orders were not supported by substantial evidence. The District Court held with them upon this point. We have examined the record and are of opinion that in each case there is substantial evidence to support the Commission's findings. No useful purpose will be served by a detailed recital of the evidence and it must suffice to say that, while the conditions in the various plants differed, in all of the cases the Commission had before it maps exhibiting the character and extent of the plant trackage, its relation and accessibility to the main line tracks of the carriers concerned, and proofs as to the volume and nature of intraplant car movements, the amount of engine service required, and other relevant facts. The value and weight of the evidence given by railroad and plant executives, and the inferences to be drawn from it, were for the Commission. In some instances the inconvenience and delay to the carriers in performing plant services was more obvious than in others, but we are unable to say that in any case the Commission's orders were not based upon substantial evidence. The orders should not have been set aside, and the decrees must be reversed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 18 F.Supp. 624.

The court accordingly believed that the evidence did not support a conviction.\n The evidence disclosed that:\n In 1928, the Secretary of the Treasury adopted a distinctive paper for obligations and securities of the United States; this paper was a high grade rag bond having a sharp rattle, very little gloss, and short fine silk fibers distributed throughout; in 1936, respondents had possession of paper of practically the same color, weight, thickness, and appearance as this distinctive government paper and cut to the dimensions of $20 government obligations; respondents' paper rattled like genuine money; it did not have red and blue silk fibers throughout, but red and blue marks were so expertly designed upon its surface that one judge, dissenting below, after \n\n[302 \nU.S. 540, 543]\n\u00a0\n a careful examination of these marks with a magnifying glass, was still wholly uncertain whether they were actually woven in the fabric or were traced on the surface.\n Did respondents' possession of this paper violate the act?\n The paper was not only perfectly adapted for counterfeiting, but it is difficult to conceive of its use for any other purpose. The history and language of the act are both of importance in determining whether Congress intended to make it a crime to possess, without authority, so close an imitation of the genuine paper adopted by the Treasury.\n\n 1. \nThe history of the law under which respondents were convicted dates from a special session of Congress in 1837. That Congress was called upon to pass legislation to meet emergency conditions following crop failures, general business distress, unemployment and discontent. Urged to action by these conditions, Congress authorized the issue of a then unprecedented amount of Treasury notes. It had long been a criminal offense to make, utter, or pass counterfeit money. Realizing that the protection of the currency required more stringent laws against counterfeiters,3 Congress made it a crime to possess any plate, blank note, or paper to be used for counterfeiting pur- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 540, 544]\n\u00a0\n poses. \n4\n This early forerunner of the present act provided in part:\n'If any person ... shall have in his custody or possession any paper adapted to the making of notes, and similar to the paper upon which any such notes shall have been issued, with intent to use such paper ... in forging or counterfeiting any of the notes issued as aforesaid ... such person ... shall be sentenced,' etc. Section 11.\n\n This original provision prohibited the possession of 'similar' paper adapted to making 'bank notes,' but such 'bank notes' obviously were to be forged or counterfeit-not genuine. This first act thus prohibited-not the genuine-but counterfeit paper, intended to be made into counterfeit obligations and its language and meaning were substantially re-enacted in 1847, 1857, 1860, 1861 and 1862.5\n Beginning December, 1860, Congress, to meet imperative needs, again authorized great increases in government obligations. By July, 1862, new issues of currency and unsettled conditions had so stimulated counterfeiting that Congress made special funds available to detect and punish those guilty of the crime. \n6\n Such action proved inadequate to curb counterfeiters, and in 1863 Congress re-enacted, strengthened and strongly reinforced the 1837 prohibition against possession of paper for counterfeiting. \n7\n The 1863 law made it a crime to 'imitate, counterfeit, make, or sell any paper such as that used, or provided to be used, for the fractional notes.' Although the law had prohibited the possession of paper imitating the genuine \n\n[302 \nU.S. 540, 545]\n\u00a0\n since 1837, this 1863 amendment struck vigorously at all who in any manner trafficked in such imitation paper.\n By July, 1864, the government had outstanding approximately two billion dollars in war obligations, and the counterfeiter had become a still greater public enemy. Under these circumstances, with more currency to be issued, and the necessity for protection from counterfeiters greatly accentuated, Congress once more re-enacted the 1837 act8 and made it a more effective weapon against counterfeiters. \n9\n The element of intent was stricken from the offense and the mere unauthorized possession of imitation paper was made a crime. Congress also combined the phrase 'paper adapted to the making of bank notes' with the phrase 'similar to the paper upon which any such notes shall have been issued.' It is the phrase resulting from this combination-'similar paper adapted to \n\n[302 \nU.S. 540, 546]\n\u00a0\n making such obligations'-which was construed by the court below to limit the prohibited paper to the genuine Treasury-adopted paper. These phrases, carried in the law from 1837 to 1864, had obviously referred to any paper suitable for counterfeiting. If the Congress of 1864 did intend by combining these phrases to exempt from the act all who had possession of imitation paper, it thereby deliberately weakened the chance of the government to convict and punish counterfeiters. We do not impute such a purpose to Congress. By the change made in 1864 Congress undoubtedly intended to make the law a more effective weapon against counterfeiters. Indeed, two days after this amendment was passed Congress authorized a special appropriation to detect and punish counterfeiters. \n10\n It is beyond belief that Congress intended to relax the law against counterfeiters at a time when the nation was engaged in financing a war. Such a construction would be neither logical nor reasonable. The section now under consideration is plainly the culmination of a long series of legislative acts, each of which has declared it to be a crime to have possession of paper, counterfeiting the distinctive paper, and suitable to be made into counterfeit obligations. Each change since 1837 was intended to make the possession of counterfeit paper more dangerous for counterfeiters.\n Finding nothing in the history of this law which supports the construction given it by the court below, we proceed to an examination and analysis of the particular language believed to justify that construction.\n\n 2. \nThat particular language is the phrase 'similar paper adapted to making such obligations.' The word 'similar,' and the phrase 'adapted to making such obligations \n\n[302 \nU.S. 540, 547]\n\u00a0\n or securities,' both describe the type of paper the possession of which is prohibited. The definitions given by the court below to this word and this phrase are irreconcilable.\n That court defined 'similar' to mean 'somewhat alike'; 'not exactly alike'; 'like, but not exactly the same.' 'Similar paper,' thus defined, cannot be identical with the distinctive paper adopted by the government, because, while the two papers would be 'somewhat alike,' they would not be 'exactly alike' or 'exactly the same.' Similarity is not identity, but resemblance between different things. \n11\n Under this definition, 'similar paper', the possession of which is prohibited, is not identical with, but differs from the distinctive paper.\n However, after giving this definition to similar paper [which is prohibited by the act], the court below concluded that the phrase 'adapted to making such obligations' limits the prohibition of the act to the distinctive paper. This conclusion is not consistent with the determination that 'similar'-also describing the paper prohibited- designates paper which is different from the distinctive paper. A construction that creates an inconsistency should be avoided when a reasonable interpretation can be adopted which will not do violence to the plain words of the act, and will carry out the intention of Congress. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n There is no inconsistency in the act unless it is assumed that the word 'obligations' refers to genuine obligations only. Since words that have one meaning in a particular context frequently have a different significance in an- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 540, 548]\n\u00a0\n other,13 it is necessary to consider the context of the words 'such obligations,' in order to determine their significance. The provision of law here construed is the last of seven separate offenses set out in one paragraph of a chapter of the Criminal Code entitled 'Offenses against the Currency.' The provisions of this chapter were enacted to prevent and to punish counterfeiting. Six closely connected companion offenses are set out in the same section with the offense charged against respondents and all either penalize the possession of, or trafficking in, counterfeit obligations of the materials and devices used to make such obligations.\n Examining the context of the words under consideration, we find that the word 'obligations' appears throughout the chapter relating to offenses against the currency, and does not always apply to 'genuine' obligations, but may, and often does, refer to 'counterfeit' or 'spurious' obligations. In order to distinguish between counterfeit and genuine instruments, the provisions in some instances specifically designate notes as 'false, forged, or counterfeited' as in section 149, 18 U.S.C.A.  263. On the other hand, section 152, 18 U.S.C.A.  266, makes it a crime for any person, without authority, to make tools to be used in printing 'any kind or description of obligation or other security of the United States now authorized or hereafter to be authorized by the United States.' Although these quoted words are 'any kind ... of obligation ... authorized by the United States,' the reference is not to genuine obligations, but to counterfeit obligations, not only printed 'without authority' but printed with counterfeit tools made by the counterfeiter. It is apparent from the context that in this instance the phrase 'obligation ... authorized by the United States' refers to a counterfeit \n\n[302 \nU.S. 540, 549]\n\u00a0\n obligation Both before and since the 1837 act words such as 'bills,' 'notes' and 'obligations' have been used as meaning counterfeit instruments. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n The relative positions of the words we are examining are important. The first word describing the prohibited paper is 'similar.' Unless th paper possessed is 'similar' to the distinctive paper of the government, its possession is not prohibited. Genuine obligations can only be made from the genuine distinctive paper, with a genuine design; with genuine lithographing; and with genuine signatures. Conversely, counterfeit obligations would be the result of designs, lithographing, signatures or paper-not gen- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 540, 550]\n\u00a0\n uine, but merely 'similar' to the genuine. When, therefore, Congress used the words 'similar paper,' it included within its prohibition an imitation or counterfeit of the genuine paper. The effect was the same as though it had prohibited possession of a government obligation bearing a signature 'similar' to the signature of the Secretary of the Treasury. After the appearance of the word 'similar,' subsequent words descriptive of the prohibited paper require a construction that will give effect to the congressional intent to prohibit the possession of paper which is an imitation or counterfeit of that adopted by the government.\n In United States v. Howell, 11 Wall. 432, this Court construed a similar statute which so far as pertinent provided:\n'that if any person ... shall falsely make, forge, counterfeit, or alter, ... any note ... issued under the authority of this act, or heretofore issued under acts to authorize the issue of Treasury notes or bonds; ... or shall have or keep in possession, ... any such false, forged, counterfeited, or altered note ... (such person) shall be ... guilty of felony,' etc. Act Feb. 25, 1862,  6, 12 Stat. 347.\n\n The defendant indicted under that statute urged that the words 'such ... note' referred back to those notes \n\n[302 \nU.S. 540, 551]\n\u00a0\n that had been 'issued under the authority of this act'; that notes issued under authority of the act were genuine; that the act, therefore, did not prohibit passing or possessing a counterfeit note.\n This Court gave credit for the plausibility of such an argument, but said it was:\n'at war with the common sense, which assures us that the purpose of the act was to punish the making of counterfeits of the notes and bonds described in the statute. ... We are to give due weight to all the words employed in describing the instrument. ... So we speak of a bank note. Now if the paper spoken of is a forgery it is not a bank note, which means an obligation of some bank to pay money. But here also the mind supplies the ellipsis which good usage allows, and understands that what is meant is a forged paper in the similitude of a bank note, or which on its face appears to be such a note.' 11 Wall. 432, at pages 436, 437.\n\n So, in this case, paper which was in the possession of an unauthorized person, and which was merely similar to genuine government paper, could not possibly be adapted to making genuine government obligations. In this statute, the words 'similar paper adapted to making government obligations' imply that the similar paper should be adapted to making obligations that purport to be genuine and valid, but are not.\n This construction is not inconsistent with a grant of authority to certain officials to permit possession of the prohibited paper. In this same chapter containing laws to protect the currency of the United States there are other similar grants of authority relating to counterfeiting devices and permission can also be granted to possess the actual counterfeiting instruments or obligations.\n The fact that Congress revised and codified the criminal laws after the Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Krakowski v. United States, 2 Cir., 161 F. 88, held that the act only \n\n[302 \nU.S. 540, 552]\n\u00a0\n prohibited possession of the distinctive paper does not detract from the soundness of this conclusion. One decision construing an act does not approach the dignity of a well settled interpretation. \n15\n It is not necessary to determine the effect of including this act in the Revised Statutes and the Criminal Code.\n We are not unmindful of the salutary rule which requires strict construction of penal statutes. No rule of construction, however, requires that a penal statute be strained and distorted in order to exclude conduct clearly intended to be within its scope-nor does any rule require that the act be given the 'narrowest meaning.' It is sufficient if the words are given their fair meaning in accord with the evident intent of Congress. \n16\n Certainly, if Congress had intended to prohibit only the possession of distinctive paper, it would have simply used the words 'distinctive paper' instead of the distinguishing words 'similar paper adapted to making such obligations.'\n The evidence does support the conviction of respondents. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the judgment of conviction is affirmed.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, dissenting.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice BUTLER and I have reached a different conclusion.\n The judicial function, as many times we have been told, does not include the power to amend a statute. And \n\n[302 \nU.S. 540, 553]\n\u00a0\n while penal statutes are not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the lawmaker, nevertheless-' Before one may be punished, it must appear that his case is plainly within the statute; there are no constructive offenses.' United States v. Resnick, \n299 \nU.S. 207, 210\n, 57 S.Ct. 126, 127.\n We think the opinion just handed down undertakes to import a meaning into the pertinent statute at war with its words. That statute requires the existence of four distinct elements before the accused can be held guilty of violating it: (1) The adoption by the Secretary of a distinctive paper for the obligation and other securities of the United States; (2) possession or retention by the accused of 'similar paper'; (3) the paper to be 'adapted to the making of any such obligation or other security'; and (4) the possession or retention not to be under the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury or some other proper officer of the United States.\n The word 'similar,' it is true, generally indicates resemblance and not exact identity, although in some cases it may mean 'identical' or 'exactly like.' Fletcher v. Interstate Chemical Co., 94 N.J.L. 332, 334, 110 A. 709. The distinction is illustrated by the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Commonwealth v. Fontain, 127 Mass. 452, 454, where it was held that the words 'similar offense' meant an offense identical in kind. The court said, 'The word 'similar' is often used to denote a partial resemblance only. But it is also often used to denote sameness in all essential particulars. We think the Legislature intended to use it in the latter sense in the statute we are considering.' To determine the precise meaning of the word here, we must turn to the statute. The crucial elements there disclosed are those embraced by clause ( 2), requiring that the paper possessed or retained be 'similar paper' \n\n[302 \nU.S. 540, 554]\n\u00a0\n to that adopted by the Secretary, and by clause (3) which requires that the paper be adapted to the making of 'such' obligation or security. It is as necessary to give appropriate effect to the latter clause as it is to the former. It is not enough that the paper would be 'similar' paper within the meaning of clause (2) standing alone; for it does not stand alone, but is associated with and qualified by clause (3). Nothing is better settled in the law of statutory construction than the rule that words by themselves may have a particular meaning, but that this meaning may be enlarged or restricted when considered in connection with other associated words. And this is more especially true where the associated words supplement and qualify the preceding ones as they do here.\n In order to apply the rule, we must ascertain the meaning of clause ( 3), since that adds the requirement that the similar paper shall be adapted to the making of 'such' obligation or security. That is to say, we first must determine the import of the word 'such'; and that is disclosed by clause (1), providing for the adoption of distinctive paper for the obligations and securities of the United States. This means, and can only mean, genuine obligations and securities, since it cannot be supposed either that the Secretary, by clause (1), is authorized to adopt paper for any that are not genuine, or that his authority under clause (4) is not alone to permit possession of paper adapted to making genuine obligations but extends to paper which resembles the adopted paper only enough to make it adaptable for counterfeiting those obligations. It follows, necessarily, that it is genuine obligations and securities and not counterfeits of them that are embraced by the word 'such' in clause (3).\n The provisions of the statute were not meant to cover counterfeiting, or preparations antecedent to counterfeiting. Their whole purpose was to penalize possession or \n\n[302 \nU.S. 540, 555]\n\u00a0\n retention by unauthorized persons of the distinctive kind of paper which the Secretary has adopted for the making of the obligations of the United States; language which, as we have said, necessarily imports genuine obligations, because if not genuine they would not be obligations of the United States at all.\n The government, however, takes the view that the statute extends to the possession of paper suitable, not for making genuine obligations, but for counterfeiting them. And this view, as we understand it, is also taken by the court in its present opinion. The difficulty with that view, however, is that it requires the introduction of an amendment so that clause (3), instead of reading 'adapted to the making of such obligations,' etc., will read 'adapted to the making of counterfeits of such obligations,' etc. Such an assumption of legislative power is inadmissible.\n That the paper here in question, even if in the hands of the Treasury, was not adapted to the making of genuine obligations, is beyond dispute. The distinctive feature of the paper adopted by the Secretary is the presence of short, fine red-and-blue silk fibers impregnated in and distributed throughout a high-grade rag bond paper. These silk fibers are entirely absent from the paper here in question; and, while it might have been used for counterfeiting government obligations, it was not adapted to making the genuine articles. The present decision brings within the reach of the statute every stationer who has in his possession for sale any highgrade rag bond paper, if it is capable of being used for counterfeiting government obligations. For the statute, it will be observed, requires no criminal intent, and nothing beyond mere possession or retention.\n The view of the statute which we have expressed was adopted thirty years ago by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Krakowski v. United States, \n\n[302 \nU.S. 540, 556]\n\u00a0\n 161 F. 88. In the meantime, Congress has left the statute in its original form. The government did not see fit to ask review of the Krakowski Case, but has apparently acquiesced in it for all those years. This court should not be expected to disregard the established rules of statutory construction in order to remedy a situation which Congress could have cured, and may still cure, by a simple act of legislation. We think the well-reasoned opinion of the court below should be accepted and its judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n303 \nU.S. 665\n, 58 S.Ct. 520, 82 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 18 U.S.C.A.  264, 35 Stat. 1116. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 7 Cir., 89 F.2d 469, certiorari granted \n302 \nU.S. 667\n, 58 S.Ct. 21, 82 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Counterfeiting increases in periods of commercial distress, unemployment, and poverty. Even prior to 1837, poverty contributed to offenses against the currency, see In re Halmagh Ackerman, 1820, 5 N.Y.

William Price, John Strickland and Edward O'Melly, 1820, 5 N.Y.City Hall Rec. 138. In 1837 the prospect of increased counterfeiting-due to distressed economic conditions and the fact that nonfederal agencies, both public and private, had already put a large amount of paper in circulation-indicated the need recognized by Congress in strengthening the law.

April 30, 1932, a check was mailed to the taxpayer for this erroneous refund. April 26, 1934, more than two years after the allowance of the refund, but less than two years after actual payment, the Government brought this suit to recover the erroneous refund.\n The Government by appropriate action can recover funds which its agents have wrongfully, erroneously, or illegally paid. \n3\n 'No statute is necessary to authorize the United States to sue in such a case. The right to sue is independent of statute,' United States v. Bank of the Metropolis, 15 Pet. 377, 401. Section 610 of the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 414, 416]\n\u00a0\n 1928 Act, relied upon as barring recovery of this erroneous and unwarranted tax refund, does not grant the Government a new right, but is a limitation of the Government's long-established right to sue for money wrongfully or erroneously paid from the public treasury. Ordinarily, recovery of Government funds, paid by mistake to one having no just right to keep the funds, is not barred by the passage of time. \n4\n There is no contention here that respondent has any right to retain this refund erroneously paid by the Government. His defense is that the statutory bar prevents recovery. The Government's right to recover funds, from a person who received them by mistake and without right, is not barred unless Congress has 'clearly manifested its intention'5 to raise a statutory barrier.\n Section 610, 26 U.S.C.A.  1646 and note urged by respondent as a statutory barrier-requires that the Government bring suit 'before the expiration of two years after the making of such (erroneous) refund.' Respondent contends that the Revenue Act of 19326 indicated Congressional intent to designate the date of allowance of a refund (the date the Commissioner signs the schedule of overassessments) as the date of refund for computation the period of limitations under section 610. The 1932 Act provides:\n'Where the Commissioner has (before or after June 6, 1932) signed a schedule of overassessments in respect of any internal revenue tax imposed by the Revenue Act of 1932, or any prior revenue Act, the date on which he first signs such schedule (if after May 28, 1928) shall be considered as the date of allowance of refund or credit in respect of such tax.' This Act in no manner \n\n[303 \nU.S. 414, 417]\n\u00a0\n relates to limitations on suits for erroneous refunds. It has no purpose in common with section 610 of the 1928 Act. The 1932 Act throws no light on the meaning of section 610.\n\n Section 610 is clear when its words are given their commonly accepted import. 'Congress may well be supposed to have used language in accordance with the common understanding.' \n7\n Webster's New International Dictionary, 2d Ed., Unabridged, defines 'refund' as 'that which is refunded' and defines the transitive verb as: 'to return (money) in restitution, repayment ....' Only by ignoring the common understanding of words could 'making ... (a) refund' be considered synonymous with 'allowing a refund.'\n That Congress had in mind the separate and distinct meanings of these two expressions is clearly demonstrated in House Report No. 2, 70th Congress, 1st Session, pages 34, 35, containing the Committee Report on the Revenue Act of 1928:\n'The section (610) provides that any erroneous refund, ... may be recovered by suit brought in the name of the United States if such suit is begun within two years after the making of the refund.'\n\n Immediately following, in referring to section 614, 26 U.S.C.A.  1671 and note the Report stated:\n'The principal change made in existing law is that in the case of a refund the interest period now terminates with the allowance of the refund, a date which often precedes the actual making of the refund ....'\n\n The Commissioner's signature on a schedule of overassessments does not finally establish a claimant's right to a refund and does not preclude further investigation and consideration of the claim. The Commissioner could later take his signature from the schedule and as pointed out by this Court might-even after a check was signed \n\n[303 \nU.S. 414, 418]\n\u00a0\n and mailed-cancel the payment and revoke the authority of payment erroneously made. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n It would require language so clear as to leave room for no other reasonable construction in order to induce the belief that Congress intended a statute of limitations to begin to run before the right barred by it has accrued. Obviously, the Government had no right to sue this taxpayer to recover money before money had been paid to him. The construction urged by respondent would allowed the statute of limitations to begin to run against recovery on an erroneous payment before any such payment is made. As said by a House Committee in reporting on a statute of limitations contained in a revenue act, 9 'Logically the period of limitation should run from the date of payment, since it is at that time that the right accrues.'\n We are of opinion that Congress did not intend the limitations of section 610 to run against the Government until the Government's right 'has accrued in a shape to be effectually enforced.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n This statute does not begin to run against the Government when a claim is erroneously allowed. It begins to run from the date of payment. The judgment below is not in accord with this construction of the statute and is\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 875,  610, 26 U.S.C.A.  1646 and note. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 3 Cir., 91 F.2d 547; certiorari granted, \n302 \nU.S. 678\n, 58 S.Ct. 265, 82 L.Ed. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Wisconsin Central Railroad United States, \n164 \nU.S. 190, 212\n, 17 S.

STATE OF TEXAS(1938)\nNo. 13\nArgued: Decided: February 14, 1938\n\n\n\n As Amended on Denial of Rehearing March 14, 1938. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 124]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John P. Bullington and F. G. Coates, both of Houston, Tex., for appellant.\n Messrs. Alfred M. Scott, of Austin, Tex., and Edward H. Lange, of Laredo, Tex., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, United Gas Public Service Company, challenges the validity of a rate fixed by the Railroad Commission of Texas for natural gas supplied by appellant for domestic uses in the city of Laredo. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 125]\n\u00a0\n The city council of Laredo, on December 15, 1931, enacted an ordinance fixing gas rates, which included a rate of 40 cents per 1,000 cubic feet for domestic consumption, with a provision for a discount of 10 per cent. on payment of bills within ten days, the ordinance to become effective on January 1, 1932. The rate had previously been 75 cents per m. c.f. with a 10 per cent. discount for payment within ten days. The Texas Border Gas Company, which was supplying natural gas to consumers in Laredo, filed an appeal with the Railroad Commission and posted the required supersedeas bond in accordance with the provisions of articles 6058 and 6059 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas (1925).1 The condition of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 126]\n\u00a0\n the bond was that the company should refund to the city for the benefit of consumers any excess of rates collected 'over and above the rates and charges that shall be finally determined to be a fair and reasonable return upon the value of its property used and useful in supplying natural gas and natural gas service to the City of Laredo.'\n Prior to the hearing before the commission, the South Texas Gas Company, which owned and operated the transmission properties and transported the gas sold to the Texas Border Gas Company at the Laredo city gate, was made a party to the proceeding. The Texas Border Gas Company applied to the city for an increase of rates and, because of the city's failure to act, took an appeal to the commission as the statute provided. The two appeals were consolidated. The United Gas Public Service Company, a Delaware corporation, entered its appearance on both appeals alleging that it had acquired the properties of both companies. The commission, by order of June 13, 1933, fixed a rate of 55 cents per m.c.f. with a penalty of 10 per cent. for nonpayment within ten \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 127]\n\u00a0\n days, and the order was made retroactive to January 1, 1932. Texas Border Gas Co. v. City of Laredo, 2 P.U.R.,N.S., 503.\n The United Gas Public Service Company then brought suit in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Texas to restrain the enforcement of the commission's order. On July 26, 1933, the State of Texas, the members of the commission, and the city instituted the present suit in the District Court of Travis county in the nature of an appeal under article 60592 for the purpose of protecting the jurisdiction of the state court and of enforcing the commission's order if determined to be valid. The state court thereupon stayed all proceedings by the commission, or by the officials of the state and city, to enforce the commission's order until the determination of the suit. On August 1, 1933, the District Court of the United States composed of three judges, 28 U.S.C .  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380, stayed all proceedings in that court pending the final determination of the suit in the state court. Subject to the order of the state court, the company has continued to charge its 75-cent rate.\n The trial in the state court resulted in a judgment on April 24, 1934, which sustained the commission's order of June 13, 1933, except so far as its rate was made retroactive to January 1, 1932, that part of the order being held invalid. The company then appealed to the Court of Civil Appeals, which rendered its judgment on October 30, 1935, reforming the judgment of the trial court so as to declare the retroactive portion of the commission's order valid and enforceable and affirming the judgment as thus modified. 89 S.W.2d 1094, 1097. The Supreme Court of the state refused writ of error.\n A motion to dismiss the appeal taken to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals was denied. \n301 \nU.S. 667\n, 57 S.Ct. 921. Upon hearing, the Court ordered reargu- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 128]\n\u00a0\n ment, noting that it especially desired to hear the parties on the state of the evidence as to the effect of the application of the commission's rate to the years 1932 and 1933, that is, as to the revenues and expenses for those years on that basis, and as to the effect upon the rights of the appellant, with respect to those years, of the bond given on its appeal to the commission. November 8, 1937. \n302 \nU.S. 647\n, 58 S.Ct. 527, 82 L.Ed. --. Reargument has been had accordingly.\n Appellant, invoking the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, contends that in the state proceedings it has been denied procedural due process and also that the prescribed rate is confiscatory.\n The proceedings before the commission and its rulings. The commission gave a full hearing. It received voluminous evidence offered by appellant and the city as to every phase of the controversy and their counsel were fully heard in argument. The opinion of the commission reviews the history of the utility from the time that the Texas Border Gas Company received its franchise from the city in 1909. The commission found the interrelation of the companies concerned and that the present appellant, which had become the owner of the properties of the former operating companies, was itself a unit of the United Gas System. It was in view of the 'interrelated company operation and ownership,' that the gathering, transmission, and distribution properties used and useful in serving the city of Laredo were valued as a combined property. As consumers in a number of other communities within the Laredo area were also served, it became necessary to allocate to Laredo its appropriate proportion. Methods of allocation were submitted by the respective parties and the commission adopted a weighted average per cent., which had been taken by the city's engineer as an approximate mean between two percentages used by the company's engineer, as coming the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 129]\n\u00a0\n closest to a fair and correct allocation. Evidence of historical cost and of reproduction cost new less depreciation was submitted. The company's appraisal on the basis of reproduction cost new, less depreciation, was $1, 231,601. The appraisal of the city's engineer on the same basis was $810, 698. The city adduced evidence showing the depreciated historical cost as of July 31, 1932, to be $709,991.23.\n The commission for the purpose of its valuation divided the properties into three groups, (a) gathering system, (b) transmission system, and (c) distribution system. The commission stated and considered the respective appraisals of each group. While the city included an allowance of $124,668 as the depreciated cost of that portion of the transmission lines extending from Pescadito Junction to the Jennings Field, a distance of about 26 miles, the commission found 'that this line was used only one day during the twelve months' period ending July 31, 1932, in transporting gas to Laredo,' and, further, that 'the condition of this line is such that it could neither safely nor profitably transport the necessary volume of gas to the City.' The commission concluded that, if the company's properties were reproduced, that section of the line would not be necessary.\n The commission then considered the questions of working capital, of going concern value, and of accrued depreciation. After referring to the respective estimates, the commission decided that 'the over-all per cent. condition' of the properties was 78 per cent.\n The commission's conclusion was that the total 'present fair value' of the properties was $885,000. The commission said:\n'In arriving at a decision and making an order herein that is deemed by the Commission to be just and reasonable, we have carefully and fully considered all the evidence presented and all the facts and circumstances re- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 130]\n\u00a0\n flected by the record herein; and upon giving due consideration to all the elements of value inhering in the property involved in this proceeding, have valued the Company's properties as an operating concern, with business attached; have made ample allowance for materials and supplies, working cash, and general overheads; and have included in such value the Pescadito-Jennings Transmission Line and the West Jennings Gathering System (although the record clearly discloses that these last two named property items are neither being used, nor are they necessary as standby equipment) and we find the present fair value of the properties of the Company used, and useful in the gathering, transporting and distributing of natural gas within the City of Laredo, Texas, to be in the sum of $885, 000.'\n\n The commission fixed the annul depreciation rate which should be allowed at 3 per cent. The commission also found that an annual rate of return of 7 per cent. on the present value of the properties was adequate.\n With respect to 'available revenue,' the commission said that the company had presented a 'setup' of operating revenues and expenses for the twelve-month period ending July 31, 1932, only. On the other hand, the city had presented a similar 'setup' covering the years ending June 30, 1929, 1930, and 1931, and for the year ending July 31, 1932-a period of four years. The commission was of the opinion that the one year ending July 31, 1932, should not be taken as a test period. It was believed to be a matter of common knowledge that 'from a general business standpoint the year 1932 was the worst year since 1929.' The city's exhibit was deemed to show that the fiscal year 1931 was also subnormal, and the commission concluded that neither that year, nor an average of those two years, should be taken as an adequate test. The commission also thought that it would be unfair to the company to take the year 1930 \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 131]\n\u00a0\n or an average of the three years, 1930, 1931, and 1932, as it appeared that the year 1930 was the best year in point of gross revenues that the company had experienced since 1928. On the whole, the commission thought that justice would be done if an average of revenues and expenses for the four fiscal years, 1929, 1930, 1931, and 1932, should be taken as the test period for the computation upon which a fair return should be predicated.\n It had been stipulated by the parties at the outset that a rate of 5 cents per m.c.f. was a fair and reasonable price of gas at the well. While the commission did not make specific findings with respect to revenues and expenses for the years which it took as a basis, it did reject certain allowances for which the company contended. As to an allowance of a gathering charge in relation to gas purchased from the Carolina-Texas field, the gathering lines in which were the property of an affiliate, the commission allowed a charge of one-half of 1 per cent. instead of the 1 per cent. which the company sought. With respect to items not particularized by the commission, we think that it substantially appears from its opinion that the commission, save as to the items disallowed, accepted the city's exhibit which covered the revenues and expenses for the four-year period and stated separately the items contained therein which were deemed to be questionable.\n The commission found the rate, for all domestic uses, of 55 cents per m.c.f., the minimum bill per user per month to be $1 and the penalty for nonpayment within 10 days to be 10 per cent., to be 'just and reasonable.' The commission found that its application would produce 'a net return in excess of seven per cent (7%) per annum on the present fair value of the properties, after provision for operations and reserve for depreciation.' The commission ordered that the rate should be effective from and after January 1, 1932, and that there \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 132]\n\u00a0\n should be refunded to the city of Laredo for the benefit of domestic gas consumers the difference between the amount collected under the existing rate and the amount that would have been due by consumers under the commission's order.\n The proceedings in the District Court of Travis county.-The trial was essentially de novo. It was begun in March, 1934, and was had before a jury, a motion by the appellants to have the jury discharged and the cause determined by the court being overruled. The entire record before the commission was placed in evidence and additional testimony was introduced as to property values, depreciation reserve accrual, revenues, expenses, rates of return, etc. It appears that the evidence was brought as near as possible to the time of trial. The evidence as to revenues and expenses which appellant adduced again related to the year ending July 31, 1932, and the years 1932 and 1933, and the appellees introduced evidence for the four-year period, to which they had addressed their computations before the commission, and also for the year 1933\n\n\n At the close of the evidence, appellant moved for a peremptory instruction in its favor and also for the suspension of the commission's order for the years 1932 and 1933. These motions were overruled. Appellant then moved to have the case submitted to the jury on 'special issues' and not upon a 'special charge.' The court stated that in its view its charge was on 'special issue' and hence complied with the request. The appellant then moved to submit to the jury certain special issues which were separately stated; that is, that the jury should make separate findings as to the values of component parts of appellant's property during the years 1932 and 1933, respectively, also as to the amount of the necessary materials and supplies and cash working capital, and the amount which should be allowed for 'going value,' and \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 133]\n\u00a0\n as to the average cost of gas at the well month and the proper annual allowance for the depreciation reserve. These requests were refused.\n The trial court submitted to the jury a single special issue as follows:\n'Do you find that the order of the Railroad Commission of Texas bearing date June 13, 1933, providing for a fifty-five cent gas rate to residential consumers within the city of Laredo, Texas, under the facts introduced in evidence before you, is unreasonable and unjust as to defendant, United Gas Public Service Company. Answer this question 'yes' or 'no.\"\n\n The court prefaced that submission with the following definitions and instructions:\n That by 'fair return' was meant that the appellant was entitled to earn a rate 'on the present fair value of its property' which it employs for the convenience of the public 'equal to that generally being made at the same time within the same general part of the country upon investments in other business undertakings which are attended by like risks and uncertainties.' That the rate of return should be reasonably sufficient 'to assure confidence in the financial soundness of the utility and should be adequate under efficient and economical management to maintain and support its credit and enable it to raise money necessary for the proper discharge of its duties.'\n That by 'fair value' was meant 'the reasonable worth of the property at this time that is being used and useful in the public service.' That by 'used and useful' was meant that it embraces all the property 'actually being used' in that service and also such property as was reasonably necessary to permit 'continuous and efficient service.'\n That by 'operation expenses' was meant such expenses as were incurred in the operation of appellant's property in furnishing gas to the people of Laredo. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 134]\n\u00a0\n That by 'annual depreciation' was meant the amount per annum that was reasonably necessary to compensate for the wearing out and any necessary replacements and retirements of appellant's property.\n That by 'reproduction cost new' was meant 'the cost to the owner under the conditions which may reasonably be expected to exist if the property were to be reproduced new.'\n That by 'going value' was meant the added value of appellant's property as a whole, used and useful for serving the city, over the sum of the values of its component parts, by reason of the fact 'that it is an operating, assembled and established property, functioning with a trained personnel, a co-ordinated plant and property, with customers attached, and its business established.'\n Referring to the findings of the commission, and the transcripts of evidence and exhibits, which were before the commission and had been introduced in evidence, the court told the jury that the same might be considered for the purpose of assisting the jury in determining whether the commission's order was unreasonable and unjust and for no other purpose. The court concluded its charge with the following instructions:\n'You are instructed that the burden of proof is upon the defendant, United Gas Public Service Company, to show by clear and satisfactory evidence that the rate promulgated by the Railroad Commission in its said order of June 13, 1933, is unreasonable and unjust as to it.\n\n'You are further instructed that in determining your answer to said issue in the light of all the evidence introduced in this case the defendant, United Gas Public Service Company, is entitled to receive a fair return at this time on the present fair value of its property that is used and useful in the public service after first deducting all necessary operating expenses and a fair and reasonable amount for the annual depreciation of said property, and \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 135]\n\u00a0\n that in considering what is a fair value of said property you will take into consideration all elements of value that have been introduced in evidence before you, including reproduction cost new of said property and the amount of going value (if any) that inheres in said property.\n\n'By 'unreasonable and unjust' is meant that the rate prescribed and adopted in the said order of the Railroad Commission was so low as to have not provided for a fair return upon the fair value of defendant's property used and useful in supplying the service furnished by the United Gas Public Service Company to the inhabitants within the city of Laredo, Texas.'\n\n Appellant took exceptions to the court's charge and to the refusal of its requests.\n The jury answered the special issue in the negative. Appellant's motion for judgment non obstante veredicto was denied and judgment was entered.\n The court in its judgment ruled that the provision in the commission's order requiring the refund of the excess collections over the commission's rate was a separable part, and as the court was of the opinion that the commission's retroactive application of its rate to January 1, 1932, and the provision for a refund, were invalid, that part of the commission's order was set aside without prejudice to the right of the city to recover the excess collections, should that provision be sustained on appeal. The judgment then enjoined appellant from making any charge in excess of the commission's rate, with direction for supersedeas pending appeal upon the filing of a described bond. A motion for a new trial, in which appellant again stated its objections to the court's rulings, was denied.\n The ruling of the Court of Civil Appeals.-The appellate court reached the conclusion that appellant had not only failed to establish its claim for reversal, and for judgment in its favor, but that 'when viewed in the light \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 136]\n\u00a0\n of the presumption in favor of the validity of the commission's rate order and of the quantum and character of proof required to overcome such presumption, the evidence adduced was insufficient, as a matter of law, to show that the 55-cent rate order was either unjust and unreasonable or confiscatory.' In that view, the court added, 'all questions of practice,' presented by appellant, 'go out of the case.'\n The court noted the fact that the commission had reluctantly included in the valuation of the property the items of $124,688, representing the Pescadito-Jennings transmission pipe line, and also had 'included the West Jennings gathering system at a value of $10,342,' although the commission found that these 'two property items are neither used nor are they necessary as standby equipment.' The court also said that there was evidence before both the trial court and the commission which tended to show 'the fair value of appellant's property to be about $700,000, and that a 2 per cent. annual accrual for depreciation would be fair and reasonable.' Referring to the evidence as to operating revenues and expenditures, the court set forth tables based on the computations of an expert accountant of the appellees showing average net revenues for the four-year period and the year 1933. These calculations were on the basis of appellant's existing 75-cent rate. The court thus stated the criterion which it applied in overruling appellant's contentions:\n'The rule is settled that rates are not based upon the results of business of any one year alone, but upon what is estimated as being the average business over a period of years; the future being gauged as nearly as possible by the past experience. ... It is also the rule that only actual experience under the rate complained of can furnish any real criterion or guide as to the effect of the rate on the business, and that this experience should be obtained by a practical test for such a period of time as \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 137]\n\u00a0\n will under the facts of the particular business determine the matters which are of doubtful or uncertain influence. In absence of an actual test of the rate, the court on appeal must resolve all doubts against the complaining party, pare down valuations unsparingly, and the rate must appear to be clearly confiscatory or unjust and unreasonable before the court should by injunction restrain its enforcement in advance of actual experience of the practical results of the rate. And while the equal protection, the due course, and the due process clauses of the fundamental laws of both state and nation (Const.Tex. art. 1,  13, 19; Const.U.S. Amend. 14) guard against the taking up, or compelling of the use of, private property for public service without just compensation, still they do not assure the public utility the right under all conditions and circumstances to have a return upon the value of the property so used. If actual experience for a proper period of time under the rate complained of should reveal sufficient reasons, the rate order may then be changed through proper channels.'\n\n Proceeding on this principle, the court said:\n'In the instant case appellant has continuously charged and collected the 75-cent rate; hence no actual test has been made under the lower 55- cent rate. An actual test of the lower rate might have resulted in a larger return, by bringing about an increase in appellant's business, and manifestly this court would not be warranted in holding that the lower rate was either confiscatory or unjust and unreasonable, as a matter of law, in advance of an actual test of the rate. ... So, when the property valuation is pared down to this lowest valuation (about $700,000), and doubtful items of expenses are deducted, the net revenues received by appellant under the 75-cent rate for the year ending December 31, 1933, would afford more than a 11 per cent. return. And calculations based on the $700,000 valuation and the estimated difference in revenues between the 55-cent rate and the 75-cent rate, show a return of more \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 138]\n\u00a0\n than 7 per cent. for the year 1933. But, even if the lower rate did not or would not yield a return of 7 per cent. for the year 1933, this court would not be warranted in enjoining the enforcement of the rate, because the test period was too short, no actual test was made under the lower rate, and the undisputed evidence showed the year to be abnormal.'\n\n In concluding its opinion, the court held that the trial court erred in its ruling that the retroactive provision of the commission's order was invalid. The appellate court said that on the appeal to the commission to review the city's ordinance, the commission was authorized to suspend the rate fixed by the city and to require the utility to give a bond 'on such terms and conditions as the Commission may direct.' The trial court had refused to receive the bond in evidence, but it appeared in the record. The appellate court quoted its condition and noted that the supersedeas bond filed on appeal to that court was similarly conditioned. The court held that the commission had the power upon determining that the rate fixed by the city's ordinance was unreasonable to 'substitute its own just and reasonable rate therefor, and to make it effective as of date of the City ordinance rate for which it was substituted.'\n The Court of Civil Appeals then entered judgment sustaining the retrospective and refund provision of the commission's order and affirming the judgment of the trial court as thus modified.\n First.-The question of procedural due process.-There is no ground for holding that appellant did not have a fair hearing before the commission. Appellant's evidence was received and weighed; its arguments were heard and considered. The commission made findings as to the value of appellant's property, the permissible allowance for depreciation, and the rate of return. The amounts of revenues and expenses for the four years \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 139]\n\u00a0\n which the commission took as a basis sufficiently appear, as already stated, from the city's exhibit to which the commission referred in its opinion. The estimated amount of revenue at the commission's rate appears from a simple calculation, applying the rate of return to the rate base after the annual allowance for depreciation. In the commission's procedure there was no lack of the due process required by the Federal Constitution. Railroad Commission of California v. Pacific Gas & Electric Company, \n302 \nU.S. 388\n, 58 S.Ct. 334, decided January 3, 1938; Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corporation v. Railroad Commission, \n289 \nU.S. 287, 304\n, 305 S., 53 S.Ct. 637, 643; West Ohio Gas Company v. Public Utilities Commission, No. 1, \n294 \nU.S. 63, 70\n, 55 S.Ct. 316, 320.\n With respect to the proceedings in the state courts, appellant urges that the case was not tried and determined as required by state law, and we are referred to the state statutes and the decisions of the Texas courts as to the proper procedure in the trial court and on appeal. It is not our function, in reviewing a judgment of the state court, to decide local questions. We are concerned solely with asserted federal rights. The final judgment of the state court in the instant case must be taken as determining that the procedure actually adopted satisfied all state requirements. John v. Paullin, \n231 \nU.S. 583, 585\n, 34 S.Ct. 178; Lee v. Central of Georgia R. Co., \n252 \nU.S. 109, 110\n, 40 S.Ct. 254; Central Union Co. v. Edwardsville, \n269 \nU.S. 190, 194\n, 195 S., 46 S. Ct. 90, 91.\n As to the requirement of due process under the Federal Constitution, appellant contends that it was denied the independent judicial judgment upon the facts and law to which it was entitled. See Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, \n253 \nU.S. 287\n, 40 S.Ct. 527; Bluefield Water Works Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 679\n, 43 S.Ct. 675; State Corporation Commission v. Wichita Gas Co., \n290 \nU.S. 561, 569\n, 54 S.Ct. 321, 324; St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 38, 49\n, 56 S.Ct. 720, 724. The proceeding in the state court undoubtedly purported to afford an independent judicial review. As the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas said in the instant case, the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 140]\n\u00a0\n trial of the issues whether the rate was unreasonable or confiscatory was 'de novo.' Appellant itself recognizes that the trial 'was essentially de novo, new and full testimony being introduced as to property value, depreciation reserve accrual, revenues, expenses, rates of return,' etc. Appellant's evidence was received by the trial court and appellant's contentions were heard. The question whether due process in the court's procedure was accorded thus comes to the mode of trial; that is, (1) the propriety of a trial by jury, and (2) the manner in which the issues were submitted to the jury.\n We do not fail to appreciate the difficulty in presenting to a jury the complicated issues in a rate case, especially where, as here, the evidence is voluminous, embracing the conflicting valuations of experts and a host of details in appraisals and in accounts of operations, with elaborate tabulations. Even in trials of such cases without a jury, the service of a special master for the analysis of the details in evidence with respect to values and return has been found advisable. We have had abundant occasion to become familiar with the difficulty of such determinations. But we are not dealing with questions of policy as to procedure. The state is entitled to determine the procedure of its courts, so long as it provides the requisite due process. And on that question we have never held that it is beyond the power of the state to provide for the trial by a jury of questions of fact because they are complicated. Cases at law triable by a jury in the federal courts often involve most difficult and complex questions, as, for example, in patent cases at law presenting issues of validity and infringement. See Tucker v. Spalding, 13 Wall. 453, 455; Keyes v. Grant, \n118 \nU.S. 25, 36\n, 37 S., 6 S.Ct. 950; Royer v. Schultz Belting Co., \n135 \nU.S. 319, 325\n, 10 S.Ct. 833; Coupe v. Royer, \n155 \nU.S. 565, 578\n, 579 S., 15 S.Ct. 199. Most difficult questions of fact in protracted trials, with much conflicting expert testimony, are not infrequently presented in criminal cases triable by jury. The issue of life or death may be \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 141]\n\u00a0\n decided in such a case. We have held that a state may modify trial by jury or abolish it altogether (Walker v. Sauvinet, \n92 \nU.S. 90\n; Maxwell v. Dow, \n176 \nU.S. 581\n, 20 S.Ct. 448, 494; Frank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309\n, 35 S.Ct. 582), but never that the time- honored method of resolving questions of fact by a jury must be abandoned by a state under compulsion of the Federal Constitution. And we find no warrant for such a ruling now.\n The question remains as to the manner in which the instant case was submitted to the jury. The special issue was submitted whether the commission's rate was 'unreasonable and unjust as to defendant.' This submission, under the court's instruction in relation to the import of the phrase 'unreasonable and unjust,' covered, as appellant conceded at this bar, the issue whether the rate was confiscatory. Appellant did not ask to have the issue of confiscation submitted by the use of that precise term. The question then is as to the denial of the submission of the particular issues which appellant requested and as to the character of the instructions given by the trial court.\n The special issues which appellant requested were for findings as to the value of component parts of appellant's property during the years 1932 and 1933 and as to the amounts necessary to cover material and supplies, working capital, going value, and certain other items. It will be observed that these special issues did not embrace all the questions which the jury should consider, as for example, the questions of operating revenues, operating expenses and return for the period to which the evidence before the court appropriately related and not simply for the years 1932 and 1933. If trial by jury was permissible, as we hold it was, we cannot say-putting aside questions of correct practice under the state law not reviewable here-that appellant was entitled under the Federal Constitution to have special issues framed and submitted to the jury, much less that appellant could demand that the particu- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 142]\n\u00a0\n lar items it mentioned should be singled out and specially passed upon. We consider that question in the light of the total power which the state possesses to provide for jury trials, and for the manner of conducting them, and not with respect to any alleged limitations imposed by state statutes. See Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 \nU.S. 674, 683\n, 18 S.Ct. 229.\n We have stated at some length, and need not repeat, the general instructions given by the trial court. The jury were instructed as to the right of appellant to receive a fair return on the fair value of its property that is used and useful in the public service and that the jury should take into consideration all elements of value that had been introduced in evidence, including the reproduction cost new of the property and the amount of going value, if any, that inhered in it. The court defined the terms that it used, such as 'fair return,' 'fair value,' 'used and useful,' 'operation expenses,' 'annual depreciation,' 'reproduction cost new,' and 'going value,' and the court explained what would constitute an adequate rate of return. No instructions were given which could be taken in any sense to conflict with appellant's federal right; on the contrary, the jury, if it duly followed the instructions, could not but enforce that right.\n Appellant, while objecting to the charge upon grounds that are not impressive, did not submit and request amplified instructions which might have aided the jury's consideration. Appellant was apparently content to object to the pertinent instructions that were given, and to a general charge, and to stand upon its limited requests as to special issues.\n Upon such a record we are unable to hold that there was a denial of federal right so far as procedural due process is concerned.\n Second.-The question of confiscation.-We have said that our inquiry in rate cases coming here from a state \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 143]\n\u00a0\n court 'is whether the action of the state officials in the totality of its consequences is consistent with the enjoyment by the regulated utility of a revenue something higher than the line of confiscation.' West Ohio Gas Company v. Public Utilities Commission, No. 1, supra. This Court will review the findings of fact by a state court (1) where a federal right has been denied as the result of a finding shown by the record to be without evidence to support it, and (2) where a conclusion of law as to a federal right and findings of fact are so intermingled as to make it necessary, in order to pass upon the federal question, to analyze the facts. Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Albers Commission Co., \n223 \nU.S. 573, 591\n, 32 S.Ct. 316; Northern Pacific R. Co. v. North Dakota, \n236 \nU.S. 585, 593\n, 35 S.Ct. 429, L.R.A.1917F, 1148, Ann.Cas.1916A, 1; Norfolk & Western Railway Co. v. Conley, Atty. Gen. of West Virginia, \n236 \nU.S. 605, 609\n, 610 S., 35 S.Ct. 437; AEtna Life Insurance Co. v. Dunken, \n266 \nU.S. 389, 394\n, 45 S.Ct. 129, 130. We make that analysis, not to determine issues of fact arising on conflicting testimony or inferences, and thus to usurp the function of the state court as a trier of the facts, but to perform our own proper function in deciding the question of law arising upon the findings which the evidence permits. Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Albers Commission Co., supra.\n Here, the issues of fact were determined in the trial court. Counsel agree that under the state practice the Court of Civil Appeals had no authority to make findings of fact. 'Where the evidence is without conflict, it may render judgment. But where there is any conflict in the evidence upon a material issue, it has no authority to substitute its findings of fact for those of the trial court.' Post v. State, 106 Tex. 500, 501, 171 S.W. 707, 708. The Court of Civil Appeals held not only that appellant had failed to make good its claim that it was entitled to judgment in its favor, but that, having regard to the presumption in favor of the commission's rate order and the clear and satisfactory proof required to overcome such pre- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 144]\n\u00a0\n sumption, appellant's evidence was insufficient as matter of law to show that the commission's rate was confiscatory. The reasoning of the Court of Civil Appeals was directed to the decision of those legal questions. Upon the issue of confiscation, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed and thus its finding of fact was not disturbed.\n Separate questions are presented \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 1]\n\u00a0\n as to the value of appellant's property and (2) as to its return from operations. As to the first, the commission found the value to be $885,000. But the commission stated that this valuation included property which was neither used nor useful. If it be assumed that the commission in the exercise of its legislative discretion might include that property in fixing a 'reasonable rate,' still appellant would not be entitled to its inclusion on the issue of confiscation. While the evidence as to value was conflicting, we are unable to conclude that there was not adequate evidence to sustain a finding that the total property used and useful, after making deductions for the portions not of that sort, was worth not more than $750,000.\n Appellant complains that the Court of Civil Appeals based its conclusion upon a valuation of '$700,000' which appellant contends is inadmissible, and that the appellate court misapplied the rule as to the burden of proof in holding that the value must be 'pared down unsparingly' to that amount. But we must distinguish 'between what was said and what was done,' between 'dictum and decision,' between reasoning and conclusion. Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n292 \nU.S. 290, 298\n, 302 S., 54 S.Ct. 647, 651, 653. What the appellate court did was to affirm the judgment of the trial court and if, as we think, a valuation of appellant's property at $750,000 would have adequate support in the evidence, we need go no further in relation to that part of the case. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 145]\n\u00a0\n With respect to return from operations, the crucial question is whether appellant was entitled to have the rate for the future fixed with sole regard to the result of operations in the years 1932 and 1933, as appellant contends, or it was permissible to fix the rate upon a consideration of the returns for a number of years, that is, for the four years prior to July 31, 1932, as taken by the commission, or for that period and the years 1932 and 1933, as shown by the evidence before the trial court. The commission held its hearing in the latter part of 1932 and made its order in June, 1933. Apart from the question raised by the retrospective feature of its order, we think it manifest that in fixing its rate for the future the commission was not limited to the results of operations for the year ending July 1932. Not only was that but a single year, but the commission regarded it as an abnormal year and the propriety of its ruling in that respect is supported by common knowledge of economic conditions at that time. Similarly, the trial court, sitting in the spring of 1934, was not bound to limit its vision to the results of 1932 and 1933. What would happen in the future was necessarily a matter of prophecy. The commission's rate had not been put into effect and in estimating what would be the consequence of the requirement the court was entitled to a reasonable basis for prediction, especially in view of a contemplated emergence from a period of extreme depression. As the Court of Civil Appeals observed, the way was open to the appellant to seek a change in the rate on proof of actual experience. Of course, appellant was entitled to take its chances on appellate review of the trial court's judgment, but it cannot complain of the delay incident to that review and its case must be judged as it stood before the trial court. We hold that there was no error in taking into consideration the results of appellant's operations for the years 1929 to 1933, inclusive, according to the evidence produced in the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 146]\n\u00a0\n trial court, and in determining the issue of confiscation in the light of the average return thus shown.\n Appellees introduced evidence tending to show that appellant's operating revenues, calculated on the basis of the 55-cent rate and after deducting the operating expenses deemed to be allowable and the annual allowance for depreciation, for the years ending June 30, 1929, 1930, and 1931, and July 31, 1932, yielded net amounts of $106,815.36, $123,293.02, $ 91,554.04, and $48,556.88, respectively, and for the year 1933, $46,371.85. Appellant contends that on the basis of the 55-cent rate its net operating revenue for 1932 would have been but $10,086.25, and for 1933, $18,408.39. We do not think it necessary, so far as concerns the validity of the commission's rate in its prospective application, to extend this opinion by stating in detail the contentions pro and con as to these estimates, questions which largely relate to the permissible allowances for operating expenses. We are satisfied that if we consider the results of appellant's operations for the entire period, 1929 to 1933, the evidence was adequate to support the judgment of the trial court.\n Third.-With respect to the question of the validity of that part of the commission's order which made its rate retroactive to January 1, 1932, considered in the light of the evidence relating to the intervening period and of the bond given on the appeal to the commission from the city's ordinance, this Court is equally divided and the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals in that relation is accordingly affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, concurring.\n Although I concur in sustaining the judgment of the court below, I do not agree that the rights of this Delaware corporation doing business in Texas are derived from the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 147]\n\u00a0\n Fourteenth Amendment1 or that the Fourteenth Amendment deprives Texas of its constitutional power to determine the reasonableness of intra-state utility rates in that state.\n Even applying the Fourteenth Amendment under the prevailing doctrine, I do not believe that this Court (apart from procedural questions) is called upon to do more than determine the sole question of confiscation. Any indication by this Court of the value of the company's property will unjustifiably affect and control subsequent valuations for rate making purposes. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The record discloses a striking absence of satisfactory evidence of the actual cost of the company's properties; its funded indebtedness; the actual investments of stockholders in the company; profits in past years; and the percentage of past profits to actual investment. These matters have important bearing upon the issue of confiscation. There is evidence that only a part of the company's depreciation reserve, accumulated over and above expenditures for repairs and property maintenance, reaches approximately $500,000-or over 40 per cent. to 70 per cent. of the various estimated values of all the company's assets. In addition appellant has not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that there is an actual investment of stockholders-over and above the amount of borrowed capital-which could be confiscated. \n3\n Appellant has obviously failed to establish all the elements necessary to prove beyond a reasonable doubt4 that the rate fixed by the State will result in confiscation of its property. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 148]\n\u00a0\n Operating Expenses.-The record shows that appellant is one of many corporate associates and affiliates connected with the Electric Bond & Share Company and the United Gas System. Practically all operating expenses appeared as inter-company charges among these associates, affiliates, etc. Under these circumstances, confiscation cannot be established merely by proof that the books of appellant show alleged expenditures purporting to have been made by or through its affiliates, associates, etc. The strong presumption of the validity of these rates- fixed by a state-can be overcome only by proof that each expenditure, alleged to have been made or incurred by or through an associate or affiliate, was in fact so made or incurred and was fair and reasonable. Such proof was not made in this case. As an illustration, a witness testifying for the city said that it was impossible for him to ascertain proper operating expenses for the year 1933, because his examination was confined to the South Texas Border Gas Company and the South Texas Gas Company 'and all I saw in support of these items was inter-company invoices, and I was not able or had no way of determining whether items were proper or not.'\n Since the major part of appellant's income is absorbed by associated companies in the name of 'operating expenses' and by intercorporate transactions, the operations and expenses of these associates, affiliates, etc., are brought within the field of inquiry. Referring to intercorporate transactions of holding companies, subsidiaries, associates, affiliates, etc., this Court has said:\n'It is urged that, as these averments were uncontradicted, they constitute, when taken with the facts previously stated a prima facie case for the reasonableness of the rate charged. This might well be true were it not for the fact of unity of ownership and control of the pipe line and the distribution system. An averment of negotiation and effort to procure a reduction in the wholesale rate \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 149]\n\u00a0\n means little in the light of the fact that the negotiators are both acting in the same interest-that of the holding company which controls both. All of these facts so averred in the pleadings would be far more persuasive with respect to the propriety of the rate if the parties were independent of each other and dealing at arms' length. Where, however, they constitute but a single interest, and involve the embarkation of the total capital in what is in effect one enterprise, the elements of double profit and of the reasonableness of inter-company charges must necessarily be the subject of inquiry and scrutiny before the question as to the lawfulness of the retail rate based thereon can be satisfactorily answered. ...\n\n'The argument is made that the proofs demanded by the commission will involve an extensive and unnecessary valuation of the pipe line company's property and an analysis of its business, and that this burden should not be thrown upon appellant. Whether this is so we need not now decide. It is enough to say that, in view of the relations of the parties and the power implicit therein arbitrarily to fix and maintain costs as respects the distributing company which do not represent the true value of the service rendered, the state authority is entitled to a fair showing of the reasonableness of such costs, although this may involve a presentation of evidence which would not be required in the case of parties dealing at arms' length and in the general and open market subject to the usual safeguards of bargaining and competition.' 5 \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 150]\n\u00a0\n Not only did appellant fail to prove the reasonableness of its intercompany dealings, but it did not-as requested in open court-produce a full list of salaries paid by its associates, affiliates, etc. It is true that evidence did show that some of the officers of associates, affiliates, etc., received from $65,000 to $100,000 a year but there was no proof of the reasonableness of such salaries or of their effect upon appellant's local gas distribution expenses.\n\n This Court has previously declared the importance of salaries in determining the question of confiscation in Chicago & G.T. Railway Co. v. Wellman, \n143 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 12 S.Ct. 400, 402. There it was said:\n'Of what do these operating expenses consist? Are they made up partially of extravagant salaries,-fifty to one hundred thousand dollars to the president, and in like proportion to subordinate officers? Surely, before the courts are called upon to adjudge an act of the legislature fixing ... maximum ... rates for railroad companies to be unconstitutional, ... they should be fully advised as to what is done with the receipts and earnings of the company. ... While the protection of vested rights of property is a supreme duty of the courts, it has not come to this: that the legislative power rests subservient to the discretion of any railroad corporation which may, by exorbitant and unreasonable salaries, or in some other improper way, transfer its earnings into what it is pleased to call 'operating expenses.\"\n\n When a public utility chooses to pay out a large part of its 'operating expenses' to corporate associates, affiliates, etc., these payments might conceivably be used to \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 151]\n\u00a0\n drain the operating company's income and to inflate the 'operating expenses.' Inflated operating expenses inevitably lead to inflated rates. Since affiliates, associates, etc., do not ordinarily deal at 'arm's length,' appellant had the burden of proving the fairness and reasonableness of all expenditures made or charged as inter-company transactions.\n Due Process and Trial by Jury.-Appellant contended in the court below that 'the submission of this case ... to a jury will deprive this defendant of that character of hearing and trial contemplated under the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the Constitution and laws of the State of Texas.' Appellant here further insists that over appellant's protest, the court below did submit the cause to a jury 'despite the recognized inability of such a body to deal adequately with proof of that nature ..., despite appellant's vigorous protest and efforts to extricate itself from this situation. ...'\n The Constitution of the United States does not prohibit trial by jury, but the Seventh Amendment, judicially construed as a limitation on the Federal government,6 provides:\n'In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.'\n\n This Court said in 18557 that 'The words, 'due process of law,' were undoubtedly intended to convey the same meaning as the words, 'by the law of the land,' in Magna Charta.' Again this Court said:8 \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 152]\n\u00a0\n 'When Magna Charta declared that no freeman should be deprived of life, etc., 'but by the judgment of his peers or by the law of the land,' it referred to a trial by twelve jurors. Those who emmigrated to this country from England brought with them this great privilege 'as their birth-right and inheritance.' ... The trial ... by a jury of one's country, is justly esteemed one of the principal excellencies of our constitution; for what greater security can any person have in his life, liberty, or estate than to be sure of not being devested of nor injured in any of these without the sense and verdict of twelve honest and impartial men of his neighborhood?'\n There is nothing in the letter or spirit of our Constitution or any constitutional amendment, which deprives a state of the right to submit issues of fact to a trial by jury. That Constitution indicates no preference for determination of facts by judges or masters appointed by judges. On the contrary, our Federal Constitution, the State Constitutions, and our national tradition demonstrate a well-established preference for trial by jury.\n'One of the objections made to the acceptance of the constitution as it came from the hands of the convention of 1787 was that it did not, in express words, preserve the right of trial by jury, and that, under it, facts tried by a jury could be re-examined by the courts of the United States otherwise than according to the rules of the common law. The seventh amendment was intended to meet these objections, and to deprive the courts of the United States of any such authority.'9\n\n Further, 'Upon the reasoning in the case just referred to (Justices v. Murray, 9 Wall. 274, 278), it would seem to be clear that the last clause of the seventh amendment forbids the retrial by this court of the facts tried by the jury in the present case. ... \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 153]\n\u00a0\n Even if we were of opinion, in view of the evidence, that the jury erred in finding that no property right, of substantial value in money, had been taken from the railroad company, by reason of the opening of a street across its right of way, we cannot, on that ground, re-examine the final judgment of the state court. We are permitted only to inquire whether the trial court prescribed any rule of law for the guidance of the jury that was in absolute disregard of the company's right to just compensation.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n This cause was tried in the courts of Texas in accordance with regular court procedure applicable to such cases. The facts were submitted to a jury as provided by the constitution and laws of that state, and in harmony with the traditions of the people of this nation. Under these circumstances, no proper interpretation of the words 'due process of law' contained in the Fourteenth Amendment, can justify the conclusion that appellant has been deprived of its property contrary to that 'due process.' In October, 1877, this Court in Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 \nU.S. 97\n, 105-in discussing the Fourteenth Amendment-said:\n'But however this may be, or under whatever other clause of the Federal Constitution we may review the case, it is not possible to hold that a party has, without due process of law, been deprived of his property, when, as regards the issues affecting it, he has, by the laws of the State, a fair trial in a court of justice, according to the modes of proceeding applicable to such a case.'\n\n I concur in the affirmance.\n Separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER.\n Mr. Justice BUTLER and I are of opinion that the judgment under review should be reversed. We adhere to the \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 154]\n\u00a0\n doctrine announced in Ohio Valley Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, \n253 \nU.S. 287, 289\n, 40 S.Ct. 527, 528, and often reaffirmed. When rates fixed for a public service corporation by an administrative body are alleged to be confiscatory, the Federal Constitution requires that fair opportunity be afforded for submitting the controversy to a judicial tribunal for determination upon its own independent judgment both as to law and facts. Here such opportunity has been denied.\n June 13, 1933, the Texas Railroad Commission directed appellant to observe a new schedule of rates. By bill presented to the United States District Court June 29, 1933, appellant challenged this action as confiscatory. July 26, 1933, the commission began this proceeding in the state court by filing an original petition which, among other things, alleged-\n'Notwithstanding defendant's remedies are adequate and complete in the courts of this State, and notwithstanding every constitutional and legal right to which it may be entitled is and will be fully safeguarded and protected in said court, the defendant, nevertheless, elected to and did, on or about the 29th day of June, 1933, file its bill of complaint in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Texas, Laredo Division, in a cause entitled, United Gas Public Service Company, plaintiff v. Lon A. Smith, et al., defendants, No. 32 in Equity, and being a cause wherein your defendant is plaintiff and wherein each and all of your plaintiffs are defendants, except the State of Texas. ...'\n\n'In said action in said United States District Court, United Gas Public Service Company alleges in substance and effect that the order entered by the Railroad Commission of Texas fixed and prescribed a rate confiscatory of its property used and useful in the public service, and alleged that said order is unconstitutional and upon said allegation ( obtained) a temporary restraining order out of said court enjoining and restraining your plaintiffs and \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 155]\n\u00a0\n each of them (except the State of Texas) from compelling or attempting to compel your defendant to observe said order of said Commission.'\n\n'Plaintiffs allege that the defendant is attempting to evade the laws of this State and the lawful order of the Railroad Commission of Texas fixing and prescribing rates and charges for the distribution and sale of natural gas within the limits of the City of Laredo, and that in charging a rate in excess of that prescribed by the Railroad Commission, plaintiffs herein, and each of them, are suffering irreparable injury, and that there is no adequate remedy prescribed by the laws of this State which will protect the public interest involved and the rights of plaintiffs herein.'\n\n'Plaintiffs are desirous of having the constitutional questions involved in the attack being made by United Gas Public Service Company upon the Commission's order heard and determined in the courts of this State, and to that end desire this court to enter a stay of proceedings in accordance with the provisions of section 380, title 28 U.S.C.A. \n1\n to the end that all proceedings in the district courts of the United States will be stayed pending a final determination of this cause in the courts of this State.' \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 156]\n\u00a0\n 'This action is filed in this court in the nature of an appeal under the terms of article 6059, Revised Civil Statutes, but such appeal is not taken because the plaintiffs herein are dissatisfied with the rates and charges prescribed in the Commission's said order, but primarily for the purpose of protecting the jurisdiction of this Court and its venue to hear and finally determine the matters in controversy and to enforce the said order if it should be determined to be valid upon final hearing.'\n\n The petition asked: That the defendant appear and answer; that upon final trial the plaintiffs have an appropriate judgment; that defendant be enjoined from charging any rates other than those fixed by the commission; also that an order issue staying further proceedings by the commission pending the termination of this suit, etc.\n July, 26, 1933, the state court entered a stay order as prayed. August 17, 1933, upon the commission's application, the United States District Court ordered that all proceedings in that court be stayed, pending final action by the state court.\n Under the compulsion indicated, appellant unwillingly appeared in the state court and filed an answer setting up its rights under the Federal Constitution. The matter was supposed to stand in that court for hearing de novo. Voluminous evidence was presented by both sides.\n Notwithstanding appellant's definite objections and its duly presented requests for adequate instructions, a single issue was submitted to the jury. 'Do you find that the order of the Railroad Commission of Texas bearing date June 13, 1933, providing for a fifty-five cent gas rate to residential consumers within the city of Laredo, Texas, under the facts introduced in evidence before you, is unreasonable and unjust as to defendant, United Gas Public Service Company? Answer this question 'Yes,' or 'No.\" The jury answered 'No,' and judgment affirming the commission's order in part was entered. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 157]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Civil Appeals took the cause for review upon the record made in the District Court. The following excerpts from its opinion sufficiently indicate the reasons which moved it partly to sustain and partly to overrule the judgment of the trial court and finally to approve the commission's action in toto:\n'We have reached the conclusion that appellant not only failed to establish its claim for reversal and rendition of judgment in its favor, but that, when viewed in the light of the presumption in favor of the validity of the commission's rate order and of the quantum and character of proof required to overcome such presumption, the evidence adduced was insufficient, as a matter of law, to show that the 55-cent rate order was either unjust and unreasonable or confiscatory. In view of this conclusion, all questions of practice presented in 'Part II' of the brief go out of the case.'\n\n'In absence of an actual test of the rate, the court on appeal must resolve all doubts against the complaining party, pare down valuations unsparingly, and the rate must appear to be clearly confiscatory or unjust and unreasonable before the court should by injunction restrain its enforcement in advance of actual experience of the practical results of the rate.'\n\n'That, in advance of any actual test of the practical result of the new rate the court on appeal will not disturb the rate where it is based upon conflicting evidence as to valuations of property or as to any other item used as a basis for the calculation of the rate, because to do so would merely substitute the findings of the court or jury upon conflicting evidence for that of the commission, and would therefore permit the court to exercise the legislative function of ratemaking. Railroad Commission v. Shupee, Tex.Civ.App., 57 S.W.2d 295, affirmed 123 Tex. 521, 73 S.W.2d 505. And that, by 'resolving all doubts against' the appellant, 'and using valuations pared down unsparingly,' there could \n\n[303 \nU.S. 123, 158]\n\u00a0\n have been no reasonable doubt in the judicial mind that the 55-cent rate was neither confiscatory nor unjust and unreasonable. Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n258 \nU.S. 165\n, 42 S.Ct. 264.'\n\n Considering the rules which the Court of Civil Appeals declared applicable to the trial, quite evidently appellant had no adequate opportunity to submit the law and facts relevant to the controversy to a fair judicial tribunal for determination according to its own independent judgment.\n A tribunal required to accept weighty presumptions against a defendant, resolve all doubts against it, pare down valuations to the utmost, and refuse a judgment in its favor when the evidence is conflicting as to valuations or other important elements, could not reach an independent judgment in respect of the law and facts-could not arrive at a fair, judicial determination. To us the proceedings in the state courts seem an empty show. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Art. 6058.

ANDREWS(1938)\nNo. 48\nArgued: Decided: January 3, 1938\n\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 517, 518]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Norman D. Keller, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. Fred R. Seibert, of St. Marys, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case we are called upon to determine whether a claim for refund of income tax, asking repayment of a definite sum upon a specific ground, is susceptible of untimely amendment to recover a greater sum on a new and unrelated ground.\n The respondent, on behalf of the estate she represented, paid the income tax shown to be due by her return, which exhibited an item of gross income of $110,891 as 'dividends from domestic corporations.' Of this total $36,750 was erroneously reported as dividends from the M. A. Hanna Company. This amount was paid her pursuant to a recapitalization of the company in which the estate owned preferred stock and, instead of being returned as a dividend, should have been treated as giving rise to a capital gain of $7,411.50.\n In December, 1931, the respondent was advised by an internal revenue agent that her return, reporting the receipt as a dividend, was considered correct, subject to the approval of the Bureau in Washington, and that, if later information should indicate a material change in the amount of tax, the statutes would require a redetermination of tax liability. October 6, 1932, as a result of conferences with representatives of the Hanna Company, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue advised the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 517, 519]\n\u00a0\n agent in charge at Cleveland, Ohio, that the cash received by preferred stockholders in the recapitalization of the company represented proceeds from a sale and that gain or loss therefrom should be determined upon the basis of the cost of the original stock. The respondent was not notified of the ruling until August 22, 1934\n\n\n February 1, 1933, respondent filed a claim for the refund of $995.52, based upon an alleged loss in the taxable year due to the worthlessness of stocks of two corporations. Consideration and action thereon were delayed pending the outcome of litigation which would affect the soundness of the claim. In 1936 this claim was rejected in part but allowed to the extent of $160, which was refunded.\n June 29, 1934, after expiration of the statutory period for filing refund claims,1 the respondent presented a claim for $6,454.09 in which she stated that it was 'filed as an amendment and amplification of claim for refund filed February 1, 1933,' and asserted that the sum of $36,750 reported as a dividend, was not such but represented the proceeds of sale of stock of the Hanna Company at a profit of $7,411.50 and that the error in the return resulted in an overpayment of $6,454.09.\n November 2, 1935, the Commissioner advised the respondent that, while an overpayment had been made, a refund would be denied because the claim of June, 1934, was wholly unrelated to that of February 1, 1933, being an independent demand based upon an entirely different ground. Pursuant to the Commissioner's holding that the latter claim was not filed within the period prescribed by law, and therefore could not be allowed, official notice of rejection was mailed December 16, 1935. The respondent brought suit in the Court of Claims which gave judgment for her in the amount of $ 5,536.97.2 \n\n[302 \nU.S. 517, 520]\n\u00a0\n Upon petitioner's representation that the decision is in conflict with decisions of this court and of two circuit courts of appeals we granted the writ of certiorari, \n302 \nU.S. 664\n, 58 S.Ct. 9, 82 L.Ed. --. We hold that the so-called amendment was in fact a new claim and its allowance was barred by the statutory provision limiting the time for presentation of claims for refund.\n Notwithstanding the reliance of each of the parties on recent decisions of this court, none of them rules the precise question now presented. They point the way, however, to a correct decision.\n In United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 62\n, 53 S.Ct. 278, the claim merely stated that there had been an erroneous overpayment the amount of which was shown by stating the taxpayer's true net income, the tax due thereon, and the amount previously paid. The claim asked repayment of the difference or any greater sum which might be found to be due. Upon the footing of this general claim a complete audit of the taxpayer's books was made and an overpayment in excess of the amount claimed was determined. After notification of this fact, but before rejection, the taxpayer amended the claim by making it specific and setting forth the supporting facts in detail. The amendment was held effective. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n In United States v. Factors & Finance Co., \n288 \nU.S. 89\n, 53 S.Ct. 287, additional assessments were made subsequent to payment of the amount shown to be due by the respondent's return. After paying part of the sum so assessed the taxpayer filed a claim for abatement of the unpaid balance. In connection with that claim the Commissioner ordered a full examination of the taxpayer's affairs, which was made. While this audit was in progress the taxpayer filed a claim for refund, couched in general terms, stating that, as there had been no final audit of its return, the purpose of the claim was to save the taxpayer's \n\n[302 \nU.S. 517, 521]\n\u00a0\n rights under the statutes and permit the Commissioner to refund any excess paid beyond the amount found to be due. No statement of grounds for the claim was included. After the period of limitations had expired an amended claim was filed setting forth the grounds in detail and asking special assessment under section 210 of the Revenue Act of 1917, 40 Stat. 307. In the interval between the filing of the first and the amended claim the Commissioner had disposed of the claim for abatement but not of the claim for refund. After the receipt of the amendment the Commissioner considered the case on the merits and found that the taxpayer's invested capital could not be satisfactorily ascertained and that a special assessment should have been made under section 210 but he rejected the claim on the ground that the amendment was not timely. We held the amendment permissible. The opinion points out that the very generality of the original claim required that the Commissioner's audit go into the question of invested capital and that, therefore, the more specific amendment called attention to no new matter not covered by the investigation the Commissioner had to make in examining the claim as originally filed.\n In each of these cases the claim failed to comply with a Treasury regulation requiring that the grounds for the relief demanded should be set forth under oath and in detail. We held that, while the Commissioner might promptly have rejected the claims for failure to comply with the regulation, such compliance was a matter he could waive and, if he considered the merits, the claim was susceptible of any amendment which would not amount, under the rules of pleading in actions at law, to an alteration of the cause of action and would not require the Commissioner to make a new and different inquiry than that which he was called upon to make in order to consider the general grounds asserted in support of the claim as presented. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 517, 522]\n\u00a0\n In Bemis Bros. Bag Co. v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 28\n, 53 S.Ct. 454, the taxpayer, in its original claim for refund, requested a special assessment under sections 327 and 328 of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1093, and submitted a supporting statement as to its affairs wherein it sought relief on three distinct grounds specified in the sections in question and submitted facts and arguments in support of each of the grounds. Two of these grounds called the Commissioner's attention to the fact that the taxpayer's invested capital had been erroneously computed. After consideration of the claim the Commissioner notified the taxpayer that there was no basis for relief under section 327(d), which furnished one of the grounds put forward by the taxpayer, but he apparently overlooked the circumstance that relief was also claimed under subdivisions (a) and (c) of that section. The taxpayer filed a protest and an amendment, which made no change of any importance in the facts and arguments already submitted, but asked that computation of the tax under section 328 be granted or, in the alternative, certain items the Commissioner had stricken from invested capital be restored. Since the original notice to the Commissioner was to the effect that valuable assets had been omitted from invested capital, it would have been open to the taxpayer in the first instance to ask for relief under section 327 and 328 or, in the alternative, for a recomputation of its invested capital in accordance with the facts set forth in the original claim. The mere addition of the prayer for alternative relief was not a departure from the claim and did not amount to a new and untimely claim but constituted a proper amendment.\n In United States v. Henry Prentiss & Co., Inc., \n288 \nU.S. 73\n, 53 S.Ct. 283, a situation materially differing from those involved in the foregoing cases was presented. There the taxpayer's claim for refund asserted that, owing to abnormal conditions affecting invested capital and income, there could be no fair computation of the tax by the appraisal of the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 517, 523]\n\u00a0\n cash value of its property under section 326 of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1092, and it should, therefore, have the benefit of a special assessment under sections 327 and 328, 40 Stat. 1093, which provide for computation of the tax in such cases without reference to the value of the invested capital and for determination of the tax according to the ratio which the average tax of representative corporations engaged in a similar business bears to their average net income. In response to the claim the Commissioner advised the taxpayer that he could not consider the propriety of a special assessment until the statutory net income and invested capital were determined and asked the taxpayer, therefore, to acquiesce in the net income and invested capital shown in the revenue agent's report or submit any exceptions it might have thereto. The taxpayer filed no such exceptions but apparently acquiesced in the determination. The Commissioner then proceeded on the basis of the facts he had ascertained and advised the taxpayer the case was not one for special assessment and the claim would be rejected. Thereafter, at an oral hearing accorded by the Commissioner before final rejection of the claim, the taxpayer presented an amendment in which it set forth that, in ascertaining its invested capital, real estate had been undervalued and certain intangibles had been improperly excluded from the computation. This court held that such an amendment, filed after the expiration of the period of limitations, could not be considered, first, because it totally changed the taxpayer's cause of action, if the analogies of pleading were to be regarded, and, second, because the original claim did not challenge the Commissioner's determination of invested capital, and an amendment which attacked this determination, fundamental to the taxpayer's contention, was in effect a new claim based upon a complete reversal of the taxpayer's former position.\n In all these cases the court found the analogies of pleading helpful in deciding whether the claim was in such \n\n[302 \nU.S. 517, 524]\n\u00a0\n form as to be subject to the proffered amendment at a time when a claim wholly new would have been barred; but the opinions point out that the analogy to pleading at law is not to be so slavishly followed as to ignore the necessities and realities of administrative procedure. Where a claim which the Commissioner could have rejected as too general, and as omitting to specify the matters needing investigation, has not misled him but has been the basis of an investigation which disclosed facts necessary to his action in making a refund, an amendment which merely makes more definite the matters already within his knowledge, or which, in the course of his investigation, he would naturally have ascertained, is permissible. On the other hand, a claim which demands relief upon one asserted fact situation, and asks an investigation of the elements appropriate to the requested relief, cannot be amended to discard that basis and invoke action requiring examination of other matters not germane to the first claim.\n With these settled principles in mind we turn to the circumstances disclosed in the present case. The claim here was not general but specific. It did not assert generally that income, gross or net, had been overappraised or, generally, that the taxpayer was entitled to deductions not taken or granted. On the contrary, it pointed to two specific items of deduction which had not been taken and to which the taxpayer claimed to be entitled. It stated that during the taxable year the taxpayer's holdings of stock in two named corporations had become worthless, entailing a deductible loss of $995. While the claim added the phrase that the taxpayer claimed the sum named, or any greater sum which might be ascertained to be due, this did not call upon the Commissioner to make a complete reaudit of the taxpayer's return. The fact that he might have done so is immaterial. He could have acted on the claim, as apparently \n\n[302 \nU.S. 517, 525]\n\u00a0\n he did, by investigating the affairs of the two corporations. It was ascertained that litigation was in process upon the outcome of which would depend a decision as to the alleged worthlessness of some of the shares in question. He, therefore, naturally postponed action on the claim until the termination of that litigation. While matters were in this posture, and after the period of limitation had expired, the respondent presented a so- called amendment of her claim having no relation whatever to the items set forth in the original claim but dealing with a wholly distinct item of $36, 750 reported as dividends received and asking that it be eliminated from that category and that the transaction be reclassified as capital gain upon a basis which would result in a reduction of tax by some $6,000. This is not a case where the Commissioner waived the regulation with respect to the particularity with which the grounds of the claim must be set forth. There was no need for him to do so. The claim was not general like that in the Memphis Cotton Oil Case and the others following in its train. It was as specific as it could be made and pointed unerringly to the items the Commissioner must consider. It called for no general audit of the taxpayer's affairs and apparently none was made. An investigation of the items designated could not have the least relation to that attempted to be opened in the untimely amendment. The respondent urges that these considerations are of no legal significance, since the claim not only called for redress of a specified grievance but demanded general relief as well. She insists we have likened a claim for refund to an action for money had and received and have required the Commissioner to accept and act upon a bill of particulars furnished him before actual rejection of the claim although the period of limitation has expired. But, as we said in United States v. Henry Prentiss & Co., Inc., supra, \n288 \nU.S. 73\n, at page 84, 53 S.Ct. 283, 285, 'This does not mean that a pleader who abandons \n\n[302 \nU.S. 517, 526]\n\u00a0\n the common count and states the particular facts out of which his grievance has arisen retains unfettered freedom to change the statement at his pleasure.'\n Were it not for the presence in the original claim of the demand for refund of any other or greater sum which might be found due the taxpayer, we think it could not even be suggested that the claim was a general one for money had and received. Save for that clause the demand was of a specific amount based upon a specific transaction. Whether adjudication in strict analogy to the rules of pleading would permit the amendment we need not determine, for the necessities and realities of administrative procedure preclude any such result. United States v. Henry Prentiss & Co., Inc., supra, \n288 \nU.S. 73\n, at page 85, 53 S.Ct. 283, 285. The very specification of the items of complaint would tend to confine the investigation to those items and there is no evidence that the examination was more extended.\n Nor can the respondent gain advantage from the Commissioner's ruling communicated to his agent at Cleveland. There is no finding that, prior to the attempted amendment, the Commissioner knew the respondent was a stockholder of the Hanna Company or, if he did, that his attention was called to the fact that the reported receipt of dividends had reference to what the taxpayer received in respect of preferred stock of that company.\n These views accord with the decisions of two circuit courts of appeal. 4 The respondent relies upon two decisions of the Court of Claims: Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. United States, 7 F.Supp. 290, and Con. P. Curran Printing Co. v. United States, 15 F.Supp. 153. In the first a claim for additional depreciation depletion and amortization of an investment in mining properties was \n\n[302 \nU.S. 517, 527]\n\u00a0\n timely made. As a result of this claim a general audit of the taxpayer's affairs was had and resulted in the determination of a deficiency much greater than the amount of refund claimed. Upon appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals the deficiency was set aside and the Board found an overassessment due to failure to allow the claimed deduction and also deductions for depreciation of other assets. The Commissioner agreed that the overpayment found by the Board was correct. Thereupon the taxpayer filed, out of time, an amendment to claim additional specific deductions in accordance with the findings of the Board. The Commissioner allowed a refund of the item originally claimed but refused a refund of the others on the ground that the amendment sought to introduce new and distinct matters. In an action for recovery of the overpayment found by the Board, and claimed in the original and amended claims, the Court of Claims gave judgment for the taxpayer. We express no opinion as to whether the result may be sustained by the fact that while the original claim was pending the Commissioner was fully apprised of the items of deduction ultimately claimed in the amendment by two complete audits of the taxpayer's affairs and accounts. A similar situation is disclosed in the second case. The decisions were, however, put by the Court of Claims upon the same ground as in the instant case,-that a claim limited to a specified item might be amended out of time to seek a refund on account of other and unrelated items,-a view we hold untenable.\n The judgment is reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852,  322(b)(1), 45 Stat. 791, 861, 26 U.S. C.A.  322 note. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 17 F.Supp. 980. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See, also, Moore Ice Cream Co. v.

Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Brien McMahon, Asst. Atty. Gen., for appellant.\n Mr. George N. Murdock, of Chicago, Ill., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether the 'Filled Milk Act' of Congress of March 4, 1923, c. 262, 42 Stat. 1486, 21 U.S.C.  61-63, 21 U. S.C.A.  61-63,1 which prohibits the shipment in \n\n[304 \nU.S. 144, 146]\n\u00a0\n interstate commerce of skimmed milk compounded with any fat or oil other than milk fat, so as to resemble milk or cream, transcends the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce or infringes the Fifth Amendment.\n Appellee was indicted in the District Court for Southern Illinois for violation of the act by the shipment in interstate commerce of certain packages of 'Milnut,' a compound of condensed skimmed milk and coconut oil made in imitation or semblance of condensed milk or cream. The indictment states, in the words of the statute, section 2, 21 U.S.C.A.  62, that Milnut 'is an adulterated article of food, injurious to the public health,' and that it is not a prepared food product of the type excepted from the prohibition of the act. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the indictment on the authority of an earlier case in the same court, United States v. Carolene Products Co., D.C., 7 F.Supp. 500. The case was brought here on appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, 34 Stat. 1246, 18 U.S.C.  682, 18 U.S.C.A.  682. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has meanwhile, in another case, upheld the Filled Milk Act as an appropriate exercise of the commerce power in Carolene Products Co. v. Evaporated Milk Ass'n, 7 Cir., 93 F.2d 202.\n Appellee assails the statute as beyond the power of Congress over interstate commerce, and hence an invasion of a field of action said to be reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment. Appellee also complains that the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 144, 147]\n\u00a0\n statute denies to it equal protection of the laws, and in violation of the Fifth Amendment, deprives it of its property without due process of law, particularly in that the statute purports to make binding and conclusive upon appellee the legislative declaration that appellee's product 'is an adulterated article of food, injurious to the public health, and its sale constitutes a fraud on the public.'\n First. The power to regulate commerce is the power 'to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed,' Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196, and extends to the prohibition of shipments in such commerce. Reid v. Colorado, \n187 \nU.S. 137\n, 23 S.Ct. 92; Lottery Case, Champion v. Ames, \n188 \nU.S. 321\n, 23 S.Ct. 321; United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366\n, 29 S.Ct. 527; Hoke v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 308\n, 33 S.Ct. 281, 43 L.R.A.,N.S., 906, Ann.Cas.1913E, 905; Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland R. Co., \n242 \nU.S. 311\n, 37 S.Ct. 180, L.R.A.1917B, 1218, Ann.Cas.1917B, 845; United States v. Hill, \n248 \nU.S. 420\n, 39 S.Ct. 143; McCormick & Co., Inc. v. Brown, \n286 \nU.S. 131\n, 52 S.Ct. 522, 87 A.L.R. 448. The power 'is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the Constitution.' Gibbons v. Ogden, supra, 9 Wheat, 1, 196. Hence Congress is free to exclude from interstate commerce articles whose use in the states for which they are destined it may reasonably conceive to be injurious to the public health, morals, or welfare, Reid v. Colorado, supra; Lottery Case, supra; Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 45\n, 31 S.Ct. 364; Hoke v. United States, supra, or which contravene the policy of the state of their destination, Kentucky Whip & Collar Co. v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n299 \nU.S. 334\n, 57 S.Ct. 277. Such regulation is not a forbidden invasion of state power either because its motive or its consequence is to restrict the use of articles of commerce within the states of destination, and is not prohibited unless by the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. And it is no objection to the exertion of the power to regulate interstate commerce that its exercise is attended by the same incidents which attend the exercise of the police power of the states. Seven Cases v. United States, \n239 \nU.S. 510, 514\n, 36 S.Ct. 190, L.R.A.1916D, 164; Hamilton v. Kentucky \n\n[304 \nU.S. 144, 148]\n\u00a0\n Distilleries & Warehouse Co., \n251 \nU.S. 146, 156\n, 40 S.Ct. 106, 108. The prohibition of the shipment of filled milk in interstate commerce is a permissible regulation of commerce, subject only to the restrictions of the Fifth Amendment.\n Second. The prohibition of shipment of appellee's product in interstate commerce does not infringe the Fifth Amendment. Twenty years ago this Court, in Hebe Co. v. Shaw, \n248 \nU.S. 297\n, 39 S.Ct. 125, held that a state law which forbids the manufacture and sale of a product assumed to be wholesome and nutritive, made of condensed skimmed milk, compounded with coconut oil, is not forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment. The power of the Legislature to secure a minimum of particular nutritive elements in a widely used article of food and to protect the public from fraudulent substitutions, was not doubted; and the Court thought that there was ample scope for the legislative judgment that prohibition of the offending article was an appropriate means of preventing injury to the public.\n We see no persuasive reason for departing from that ruling here, where the Fifth Amendment is concerned; and since none is suggested, we might rest decision wholly on the presumption of constitutionality. But affirmative evidence also sustains the statute. In twenty years evidence has steadily accumulated of the danger to the public health from the general consumption of foods which have been stripped of elements essential to the maintenance of health. The Filled Milk Act was adopted by Congress after committee hearings, in the course of which eminent scientists and health experts testified. An extensive investigation was made of the commerce in milk compounds in which vegetable oils have been substituted for natural milk fat, and of the effect upon the public health of the use of such compounds as a food substitute for milk. The conclusions drawn from evidence presented at the hearings were embodied in reports of the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 144, 149]\n\u00a0\n House Committee on Agriculture, H.R. No. 365, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., and the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, Sen.Rep. No. 987, 67th Cong., 4th Sess. Both committees concluded, as the statute itself declares, that the use of filled milk as a substitute for pure milk is generally injurious to health and facilitates fraud on the public. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n There is nothing in the Constitution which compels a Legislature, either national or state, to ignore such evidence, nor need it disregard the other evidence which amply supports the conclusions of the Congressional committees that the danger is greatly enhanced where an inferior product, like appellee's, is indistinguishable from \n\n[304 \nU.S. 144, 150]\n\u00a0\n a valuable food of almost universal use, thus making fraudulent distribution easy and protection of the consumer difficult. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[304 \nU.S. 144, 151]\n\u00a0\n Here the prohibition of the statute is inoperative unless the product is 'in imitation or semblance of milk, cream, or skimmed milk, whether or not condensed.' Section 1(c), 21 U.S.C.A.  61(c). Whether in such circumstance the public would be adequately protected by the prohibition of false labels and false branding imposed by the Pure Food and Drugs Act, 21 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., or whether it was necessary to go farther and prohibit a substitute food product thought to be injurious to health if used as a substitute when the two are not distinguishable, was a matter for the legislative judgment and not that of courts. Hebe Co. v. Shaw, supra; South Carolina State Highway Department v. Barnwell Bros. Inc ., \n303 \nU.S. 177\n, 58 S.Ct. 510, decided February 14, 1938. It was upon this ground that the prohibition of the sale of oleomargarine made in imitation of butter was held not to infringe the Fourteenth Amendment in Powell v. Pennsylvania, \n127 \nU.S. 678\n, 8 S.Ct. 992, 1257; Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio, \n183 \nU.S. 238\n, 22 S.Ct. 120. Compare McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27, 63\n, 24 S.Ct. 769, 1 Ann.Cas. 561; Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192\n, 33 S.Ct. 44.\n Appellee raises no valid objection to the present statute by arguing that its prohibition has not been extended to oleomargarine or other butter substitutes in which vegetable fats or oils are substituted for butter fat. The Fifth Amendment has no equal protection clause, and even that of the Fourteenth, applicable only to the states, does not compel their Legislatures to prohibit all like evils, or none. A Legislature may hit at an abuse which it has found, even though it has failed to strike at another. Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota, \n226 \nU.S. 157, 160\n, 33 S.Ct. 66; Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373, 384\n, 35 S.Ct. 342, L.R.A.1915F, 829; Hall v. Geiger-Jones Co., \n242 \nU.S. 539, 556\n, 37 S.Ct. 217, L.R.A.1917F, 514, Ann.Cas.1917C, 643; Farmers' & Merchants' Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank, \n262 \nU.S. 649, 661\n, 43 S.Ct. 651, 656, 30 A.L.R. 635. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 144, 152]\n\u00a0\n Third. We may assume for present purposes that no pronouncement of a Legislature can forestall attack upon the constitutionality of the prohibition which it enacts by applying opprobrious epithets to the prohibited act, and that a statute would deny due process which precluded the disproof in judicial proceedings of all facts which would show or tend to show that a statute depriving the suitor of life, liberty, or property had a rational basis.\n But such we think is not the purpose or construction of the statutory characterization of filled milk as injurious to health and as a fraud upon the public. There is no need to consider it here as more than a declaration of the legislative findings deemed to support and justify the action taken as a constitutional exertion of the legislative power, aiding informed judicial review, as do the reports of legislative committees, by revealing the rationale of the legislation. Even in the absence of such aids, the existence of facts supporting the legislative judgment is to be presumed, for regulatory legislation affecting ordinary commercial transactions is not to be pronounced unconstitutional unless in the light of the facts made known or generally assumed it is of such a character as to preclude the assumption that it rests upon some rational basis within the knowledge and experience of the legislators. \n4\n See Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 144, 153]\n\u00a0\n Brownell, \n294 \nU.S. 580, 584\n, 55 S.Ct. 538, 540, and cases cited, The present statutory findings affect appellee no more than the reports of the Congressional committees and since in the absence of the statutory findings they would be presumed, their incorporation in the statute is no more prejudicial than surplusage.\n Where the existence of a rational basis for legislation whose constitutionality is attacked depends upon facts beyond the sphere of judicial notice, such facts may properly be made the subject of judicial inquiry, Borden's Farm Products Co. v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 194\n, 55 S.Ct. 187, and the constitutionality of a statute predicated upon the existence of a particular state of facts may be challenged by showing to the court that those facts have ceased to exist. Chastleton Corporation v. Sinclair, \n264 \nU.S. 543\n, 44 S.Ct. 405. Similarly we recognize that the constitutionality of a statute, valid on its face, may be assailed by proof of facts tending to show that the statute as applied to a partic- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 144, 154]\n\u00a0\n ular article is without support in reason because the article, although within the prohibited class, is so different from others of the class as to be without the reason for the prohibition, Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton R. Co., \n295 \nU.S. 330, 349\n, 351 S., 352, 55 S.Ct. 758, 762, 763, see Whitney v. California, \n274 \nU.S. 357, 379\n, 47 S.Ct. 641; cf. Morf v. Bingaman, \n298 \nU.S. 407, 413\n, 56 S.Ct. 756, 759, though the effect of such proof depends on the relevant circumstances of each case, as for example the administrative difficulty of excluding the article from the regulated class. Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., \n301 \nU.S. 495, 511\n, 512 S., 57 S.Ct. 868, 873, 109 A.L.R. 1327; South Carolina State Highway Department v. Barnwell Bros., Inc., \n303 \nU.S. 177\n, 58 S.Ct. 510, decided February 14, 1938. But by their very nature such inquiries, where the legislative judgment is drawn in question, must be restricted to the issue whether any state of facts either known or which could reasonably be assumed affords support for it. Here the demurrer challenges the validity of the statute on its face and it is evident from all the considerations presented to Congress, and those of which we may take judicial notice, that the question is at least debatable whether commerce in filled milk should be left unregulated, or in some measure restricted, or wholly prohibited. As that decision was for Congress, neither the finding of a court arrived at by weighing the evidence, nor the verdict of a jury can be substituted for it. Price v. Illinois, \n238 \nU.S. 446, 452\n, 35 S.Ct. 892; Hebe Co. v. Shaw, supra, \n248 \nU.S. 297, 303\n, 39 S.Ct. 125; Standard Oil Co. v. Marysville, \n279 \nU.S. 582, 584\n, 49 S.Ct. 430, 431; South Carolina v. Barnwell Bros., Inc., supra, citing Worcester County Trust Co. v. Riley, \n302 \nU.S. 292\n, 58 S.Ct. 185.\n The prohibition of shipment in interstate commerce of appellee's product, as described in the indictment, is a constitutional exercise of the power to regulate interstate commerce. As the statute is not unconstitutional on its face, the demurrer should have been overruled and the judgment will be reversed.\n Reversed. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 144, 155]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice BLACK concurs in the result and in all of the opinion except the part marked 'Third.'\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS thinks that the judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER.\n I concur in the result. Prima facie the facts alleged in the indictment are sufficient to constitute a violation of the statute. But they are not sufficient conclusively to establish guilt of the accused. At the trial it may introduce evidence to show that the declaration of the act that the described product is injurious to public health and that the sale of it is a fraud upon the public are without any substantial foundation. Mobile, J. & K.C.R.R. v. Turnipseed, \n219 \nU.S. 35, 43\n, 31 S.Ct. 136, 32 L.R.A.,N.S., 226, Ann.Cas.1912A, 463; Manley v. Georgia, \n279 \nU.S. 1, 6\n, 49 S.Ct. 215, 217. The provisions on which the indictment rests should if possible be construed to avoid the serious question of constitutionality. Federal Trade Comm. v. Amer. Tobacco Co., \n264 \nU.S. 298, 307\n, 44 S.Ct. 336, 337, 32 A.L.R. 786; Panama R.R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375, 390\n, 44 S.Ct. 391, 395; Missouri Pac. R.R. v.

If construed to exclude from interstate commerce wholesome food products that demonstrably are neither injurious to health nor calculated to deceive, they are repugnant to the Fifth Amendment. Weaver v. Palmer Bros. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 402, 412\n, 413 S., 46 S. Ct. 320, 322. See People v. Carolene Products Co., 345 Ill. 166, 177 N.E. 698. Carolene Products Co. v.

The allegation of the indictment that Milnut 'is an adulterated article of food, injurious to the public health,' tenders an issue of fact to be determined upon evidence. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The relevant portions of the statute are as follows:\n'Section 61. ... (c) The term 'filled milk' means any milk, cream, or skimmed milk, whether or not condensed, evaporated, concentrated, Powdered, dried, or desiccated, to which has been added, or which has been blended or compounded with, any fat or oil other than milk fat, so that the resulting product is in imitation or semblance of milk, cream, or skimmed milk, whether or not condensed, evaporated, concentrated, powdered, dried, or desiccated.'\n\n's 62. ... It is declared that filled milk, as herein defined, is an adulterated article of food, injurious to the public health, and its sale constitutes a fraud upon the public. It shall be unlawful for any person to ... ship or deliver for shipment in interstate or foreign commerce, any filled milk.'\n\n Section 63 imposes as penalties for violations 'a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment of not more than one year, or both.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The reports may be summarized as follows: There is an extensive commerce in milk compounds made of condensed milk from which the butter fat has been extracted and an equivalent amount of vegetable oil, usually coconut oil, substituted. These compounds resemble milk in taste and appearance and are distributed in packages resembling those in which pure condensed milk is distributed. By reason of the extraction of the natural milk fat the compounded product can be manufactured and sold at a lower cost then pure milk. Butter fat, which constitutes an important part of the food value of pure milk, is rich in vitamins, food elements which are essential to proper nutrition, and are wanting in vegetable oils. The use of filled milk as a dietary substitute for pure milk results, especially in the case of children, in undernourishment, and induces diseases which attend malnutrition. Despite compliance with the branding and labeling requirements of the Pure Food and Drugs Act, 21 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., there is widespread use of filled milk as a food substitute for pure milk. This is aided by their identical taste and appearance, by the similarity of the containers in which they are sold, by the practice of dealers in offering the inferior product to customers as being as good as or better than pure condensed milk sold at a higher price, by customers' ignorance of the respective food values of the two products, and in many sections of the country by their inability to read the labels placed on the containers. Large amounts of filled milk, much of it shipped and sold in bulk, are purchased by hotels and boarding houses, and by manufactures of food products, such as ice cream, to whose customers labeling restrictions afford no protection. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] There is now an extensive literature indicating wide recognition by scientists and dietitians of the great importance to the public health of butter fat and whole milk as the prime source of vitamins, which are essential growth producing and disease preventing elements in the diet. See Dr. Henry C. Sherman, The Meaning of Vitamin A, in Science, Dec. 21, 1928, p. 619; Dr. E. V. McCollum et al., The Newer Knowledge of Nutrition, 1929 Ed., pp. 134, 170, 176, 177; Dr. A. S.

On the first hearing, the Court of Claims made special findings of fact and decided as a conclusion of law that respondent's patent was valid and had been infringed by the United States and that respondent was entitled to compensation. Judgment was entered accordingly. 81 Ct.Cl. 785. On review by writ of certiorari, this Court held that validity and infringement were ultimate facts to be found by the Court of Claims and, as these facts had not been found, the judgment was vacated and the case was remanded to that court with instructions to find specifically whether respondent's patent was valid and, if so, whether it had been infringed. United States v. Esnault-Pelterie, \n299 \nU.S. 201\n, 57 S.

Fried Krupp, \n224 \nU.S. 290\n, 32 S.Ct. 488. The Congress has determined the conditions upon which the United States consents to be sued. By the applicable statute Congress has permitted suit to be brought in the Court of Claims for reasonable compensation for the infringing use or manufacture. Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 851, as amended by Act of July 1, 1918, 40 Stat. 705, 35 U.S.C.  68, 35 U.S.C.A.  68. Review by this Court of the judgment in such a suit is thus subject to the rules which have been established for the review of the judgments of the Court of Claims. That review is limited to questions of law.\n The Act of March 3, 1863, c. 92, 12 Stat. 765, providing for suits against the United States in the Court of Claims, authorized appeals to this Court under such regulations as this Court should direct. See, also, Act of March 3, 1887, c. 359,  4, 24 Stat. 505, 506, 28 U.S.C.  761, 28 U.S.C.A.  761. The rules first adopted provided for the finding of the facts by the Court of Claims and directed that 'The facts so found are to be the ultimate facts or propositions which the evidence shall establish, in the nature of a special verdict, and not the evidence on which the ultimate facts are founded.' Rule 1, 3 Wall. VII. The present rule, under section 3(b) of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 28 U.S. C.A.  288(b), governing review upon certiorari, is to the same effect. Rule 41, par. 3, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 354. This established practice was thus described in Luckenbach S.S. Company v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 533, 538\n, 539 S., 47 S.Ct. 186, 188:\n'This court uniformly has regarded the legislation and rules as confining the review to questions of law shown by \n\n[303 \nU.S. 26, 29]\n\u00a0\n the record when made up as the rules direct. Bills of exception are not recognized in either the legislation or the rules; nor is there other provision for bringing the evidence into the record or including therein the various rulings involved in applying to the evidence presented the rules which mark the line between when properly may be considered and what must be rejected. As long ago as Mahan v. United States, 14 Wall. 109, 111, this court said of the rules that they could not be examined 'without seeing that the purpose was to bring nothing here for review but questions of law, leaving the Court of Claims to exercise the functions of a jury in finding facts, equivalent to a special verdict, and with like effect.\"1\n\n In a patent case in the Court of Claims under the act of 1910 the questions of validity and infringement are questions of fact. We have said that, for the purposes of our review in such a case, the findings of the Court of Claims 'are to be treated like the verdict of a jury, and we are not at liberty to refer to the evidence, any more than to the opinion, for the purpose of eking out, controlling, or modifying their scope.' Brothers v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 88, 93\n, 39 S.Ct. 426; Stilz v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 144, 147\n, 148 S., 46 S.Ct. 37, 38; United States v. Esnault-Pelterie, supra. The requirement that the Court of Claims should find the ultimate facts which are controlling places upon that court the duty of resolving conflicting inferences and to draw from the evidence the necessary conclusions of fact. United States v. Adams, 6 Wall. 101, 112. Even though the finding determines a mixed question of law and fact, the finding is conclusive unless the court is able 'to so separate the question as to see clearly what and where the mistake of law is.' Ross v. Day, \n232 \nU.S. 110, 117\n, 34 S.Ct. 233, 234; \n\n[303 \nU.S. 26, 30]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Omaha Tribe of Indians, \n253 \nU.S. 275, 281\n, 40 S.Ct. 522, 524; Stilz v. United States, supra; United States v. Swift & Co., \n270 \nU.S. 124, 138\n, 46 S.Ct. 308, 313.\n In the instant case, as pointed out in our previous opinion, there are 47 findings of fact preceding the findings of the ultimate facts, as now made, and by reference there are included 28 exhibits on 266 pages. These references cover a number of patents claimed to be in analogous arts. From these, the Government seeks to establish that the device in question was not patentable over prior disclosures. But this is not a case where the Court of Claims has presented in its findings all the evidence upon which the ultimate facts are based so that it appears on the face of the findings that the judgment is necessarily wrong as matter of law. United States v. Clark, \n96 \nU.S. 37\n, 40. Compare United States v. Berdan Firearms Mfg. Co., \n156 \nU.S. 552, 573\n, 15 S.Ct. 420; Stone v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 380, 383\n, 17 S.Ct. 71. The opinion of the Court of Claims contains an elaborate review of the patents to which reference is made, and it discloses that there was 'considerable contradictory testimony' by the various experts for the plaintiff and the defendant. That testimony is not here, and would not appropriately form part of the record brought to this Court, as it was the duty of the court below, and is not ours, to deal with the conflicts of statement or inferences to which it might give rise. We are not unmindful of the rule that where, with all the evidence before the court, it appears that no substantial dispute of fact is presented, and that the case may be determined by a mere comparison of structures and extrinsic evidence is not needed for purposes of explanation, or evaluation of prior art, or to resolve questions of the application of descriptions to subject-matter, the questions of invention and infringement may be determined as questions of law. Heald v. Rice, \n104 \nU.S. 737\n, 749; Singer Mfg. Co. v. Cramer, \n192 \nU.S. 265, 275\n, 24 S.Ct. 291; Sanitary \n\n[303 \nU.S. 26, 31]\n\u00a0\n Refrigerator Company v. Winters, \n280 \nU.S. 30, 36\n, 50 S.Ct. 9, 10. But we do not think that rule is applicable where we are unable to examine the testimony which was heard by the court below and we cannot say that it was of no importance or determine its value in the light of the disputes revealed. We should not be justified in taking up the patents set forth in the findings and, in the absence of the explanatory and construing testimony of the expert witnesses with respect to the pertinent fact situations, in attempting to pass upon the various questions, whether of a scientific nature or otherwise, that are involved and upon such a necessarily limited consideration in overruling the conclusions of fact reached by the Court of Claims upon the entire record. Compare Bischoff v. Wethered, 9 Wall. 812, 815, 816; Royer v. Schultz Belting Co ., \n135 \nU.S. 319, 325\n, 10 S.Ct. 833; St. Paul Plow Works v. Starling, \n140 \nU.S. 184, 196\n, 197 S., 11 S.Ct. 803; Coupe v. Royer, \n155 \nU.S. 565\n, 577-580, 15 S.Ct. 199.\n We may, of course, inquire whether the subordinate or circumstantial findings made by the court below necessarily override its ultimate findings of fact and show that the judgment in point of law is not sustainable. But we have no such case here. Nor is the case like that of a review by a Circuit Court of Appeals of decisions of boards, such as the Board of Tax Appeals, where the evidence is before the appellate court and the question is whether there was substantial evidence before the Board to support the findings made. Compare Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589, 600\n, 51 S.Ct. 608, 612; Helvering v. Rankin, \n295 \nU.S. 123, 131\n, 55 S.Ct. 732, 736; Helvering v. Tex-Penn. Co., \n300 \nU.S. 481, 491\n, 57 S.Ct. 569, 573. We must take the findings of fact as made below. If, in the instant case, the subordinate findings had required a decree in favor of the government the case would not have been remanded. United States v. Esnault-Pelterie, supra, \n299 \nU.S. 201\n, at page 206, 57 S.Ct. 159, 162; Botany Worsted Mills v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 282, 290\n, 49 S.Ct. 129, 132; United States v. Wells, \n283 \nU.S. 102, 120\n, 51 S.Ct. 446, 452. And it cannot be said that the ultimate findings, now made, as \n\n[303 \nU.S. 26, 32]\n\u00a0\n to validity and infringement are necessarily overborne by the subordinate findings.\n The argument that the government is precluded from obtaining the sort of review which is permissible in this Court, when there is a conflict between circuit courts of appeals as to validity and infringement of patents, and the questions are submitted upon the evidence taken in the District Court, is unavailing, for the result is due to the procedure which has been established by the Congress for the determination of claims against the United States.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BLACK is of the opinion that the findings do not show infringement of any valid patent; or that appellee invented either a vertical lever or a universal joint or the combined use of a vertical lever and a universal joint to control air planes or machinery; he believes the findings show that such means of control were in general use long before appellee-five years after his original application for a patent-filed an amendment asserting this claim. For these reasons he believes the judgment should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, also, United States v.

GARBUTT OIL CO.(1938)\nNo. 262\nArgued: December 9, 1937Decided: January 3, 1938\n\n\n\n Mr. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Norman D. Keller, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. L. A. Luce, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The issue in this case is similar to that presented in United States v. Andrews, \n302 \nU.S. 517\n, 58 S.Ct. 315, decided this day. The action was brought by the respondent in the District Court for Southern California to recover an alleged overpayment of in- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 528, 529]\n\u00a0\n come taxes for 1919. There is no controversy as to the facts found by the trial court. The respondent, a California corporation, acquired a lease of oil property October 3, 1907. April 10, 1911, the directors resolved that all oil produced after January 1 of that year should be transferred in kind to the lessors to the extent of their royalty interest and to the company's stockholders pro rata to their respective holdings, so long as the latter should pay calls for money necessary to defray the company's expenses. The resolution remained in effect to and including the year 1919 and distribution of all oil produced was made accordingly. In its books of account and its return for income tax the respondent recorded at market value the oil produced and treated the difference between that value and the cost of production as income. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue followed the same method in computing taxable income. In its 1919 return the respondent disclosed a net income of $16,928.61 and a tax liability of $ 2,072.68 which was paid during the year 1920. The Commissioner, as the result of an audit, assessed an additional tax of $3,105.65 which was paid April 3, 1925\n\n\n March 30, 1929, within the four-year period of limitations prescribed by the applicable statute,1 the respondent filed a claim for the return of the additional tax so paid, based upon two grounds: First, that the respondent was entitled to an additional deduction of $12,500 for the amortization of the cost of a drilling contract with Union Oil Company by which the latter, in consideration of $250,000 par value of respondent's stock, agreed to provide expenses of developing the leased oil property, reimbursement to be made only out of oil produced; and, second, that, in respect of excess profits tax, its invested capital had been understated by failure to include the unrecovered cost of the same contract in the sum of $109,375. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 528, 530]\n\u00a0\n While this claim was pending, but subsequent to the expiration of the period of limitation, the respondent filed a 'Statement of Garbutt Oil Company ... for the purpose of perfecting and completing claim for refund covering alleged overpayment of income tax for the calendar year 1919.' Therein the respondent asserted that it 'now develops that a further reason exists in support of' the pending claim since, by distribution of oil in kind, the respondent realized no taxable income during 1919, and that 'it therefore follows that even though the specific grounds set forth in the claim for refund are denied said claim should, nevertheless, be allowed in full,' for the reasons set forth in the statement. Refund was demanded of the entire tax paid for 1919 ($5,178.33) 'or so much thereof as is properly refundable within the statute of limitations.' August 12, 1929, the Commissioner wrote the respondent, concerning the merits of the original claim and the amendment, stating that a refund of $3,105.65 would not be allowed but that a hearing could be had upon the proposed rejection if requested in writing. On October 4, 1929, a conference was held, but it does not appear whether the merits of the amendment were discussed. November 13, 1929, the Commissioner advised the respondent that the claim would be rejected on the merits and that the new contention embodied in the statement filed would be rejected as it was not referred to in the timely claim and was presented only after the expiration of the period of limitations and after the expiration of the time allowed to perfect informal claims, persuant to a Treasury decision. Formal rejection of the claim was made November 21, 1929.\n The respondent brought suit for the recovery of the $3,105.65, it being admitted that the remainder of the tax paid for the year 1919 could not be recovered because not claimed within the four-year period specified in the statute. At the trial the grounds of the refund \n\n[302 \nU.S. 528, 531]\n\u00a0\n claim originally filed were abandoned and recovery was sought upon the basis of the statement filed after the expiration of the statutory period of limitation. The court held that the latter did not constitute an amendment of the claim originally filed and came too late although it also found that the Commissioner had considered the late contention on its merits. Judgment was entered in favor of the United States. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding the statement filed as an amendment was germane to the original refund claim and that both were grounded in substantially the same facts. \n2\n We granted certiorari to resolve alleged conflict of decision. \n302 \nU.S. 671\n, 58 S.Ct. 37, 82 L.Ed. --.\n In view of what has been said in United States v. Andrews, supra, it is necessary only to inquire in the instant case whether the original claim was specific and the so-called amendment completely shifted to a totally different ground for refund.\n The transactions of the taxpayer which gave rise to its tax liability were exceedingly simple, due to the fact that it had resorted to distribution of all the oil produced, partly to its lessors as royalty and partly to its stockholders in return for their advancing the corporate expenses. If it was liable for income tax, the method of calculation it adopted was apparently the correct one.\n Claim for refund was not filed until 1929, when the statute of limitations had barred refund of all payments made by the respondent except the amount of the additional assessment paid in 1925. In an effort to recover that much of the tax paid for the year 1919 the claim set out two grounds: First, that a deduction of $12,500 should be allowed for amortization of a drilling contract which the company had, and, second, that its invested capital should have been increased by more than $100,000 to embrace the unrecovered cost of this drilling contract. The \n\n[302 \nU.S. 528, 532]\n\u00a0\n claim directed the Commissioner's attention to these two items only. It gave him no notice that the taxpayer claimed not to have been in receipt of any income whatever for the taxable year. The documents would not naturally suggest any such claim, for, as in United States v. Henry Prentiss & Co., Inc., \n288 \nU.S. 73\n, 53 S.Ct. 283, the ground asserted in the later demand was totally inconsistent with and involved a negation of that specified in the claim for refund. Before the Commissioner had acted on the claim for refund the respondent, in an effort to evidence continuity and identity of claim, filed its so-called statement perfecting and completing the claim for refund. This abandoned the grounds originally alleged in support of the claim. The position taken in the amendment was that the taxpayer had no income whatever and that, if the Commissioner refused refund on the basis of a rejection of the deductions claimed from gross income in the original demand, he should find that the taxpayer's operations were not productive of any income to it.\n In defense of the amendment the respondent says that it was claiming only the $3,105.65 paid in 1929 pursuant to the additional assessment; that in no event could it recover the entire tax paid; that, if the original grounds for claiming refund of payment of the sum in question had been held valid, this would have been sufficient to require the refund of the whole of the sum, and the amended claim would have no different result. This contention is advanced to persuade us that, after all, the cause of action in this case was for the recovery of $3,105.65 as money had and received to the respondent's use, and that, therefore, there is no departure and no new cause of action asserted by the amendment. To adopt this view would be to disregard what was said in earlier cases to the effect that the analogies of pleading must not be pressed to such an extent as to disregard the realities of administrative procedure. The claim as filed called for no investigation \n\n[302 \nU.S. 528, 533]\n\u00a0\n of the question whether the taxpayer's transactions gave rise to income. On the contrary, the grounds advanced assumed the receipt of income. The claim being thus specific, the Commissioner was entitled to take it at face value and to examine only the points to which it directed his attention. It would be to disregard the natural course of procedure in the Bureau to suppose that grounds thus specifically asserted would direct attention to another at war with them.\n The respondent urges that, although the amendment was not timely, the Commissioner, in considering the merits of the position taken therein, waived any objection which might have been available to him that this position was not disclosed in the original claim. The contention is bottomed upon the fact that, in his letter of August 12, 1929, the Commissioner refers to the reasons advanced in the untimely statement. The argument confuses the power of the Commissioner to disregard a statutory mandate with his undoubted power to waive the requirements of the Treasury regulations. The distinction was pointed out in United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 62, 71\n, 53 S.Ct. 278, 281, wherein it was said: 'The line of division must be kept a sharp one between the function of a statute requiring the presentation of a claim within a given period of time, and the function of a regulation making provision as to form. The function of the statute, like that of limitations generally, is to give protection against stale demands. The function of the regulation is to facilitate research.' In the cited case, and others decided at about the same time, we held that, while the Commissioner might have enforced the regulation and rejected a claim for failure to comply with it in omitting to state with particularity the grounds on which the claim was based, he was not bound to do so, but might waive the requirement of the regulation and consider a general claim on its merits. This was far from holding that after \n\n[302 \nU.S. 528, 534]\n\u00a0\n the period set by the statute for the filing of claims he had power to accept and act upon claims that complied with or violated his regulations. Tucker v. Alexander, \n275 \nU.S. 228\n, 48 S.Ct. 45, 46, cited by the respondent, is clearly distinguishable. There a timely claim was filed and disallowed. It alleged two specific grounds for refund. Suit was brought to recover the alleged overpayment and again reliance was placed on the same two specific grounds. At the trial of the action, and within the period of limitations, the taxpayer abandoned the grounds alleged in its claim and complaint and asserted a new ground. Counsel for the government stated that the new question brought forward was the only one involved in the case and stipulated as to the amount to be recovered if the trial court should hold in favor of the taxpayer on this new ground. The court did so. On appeal the government, for the first time, raised the point of the insufficiency of the claim for refund and the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the new basis for the claim did not sustain recovery because reference had not been made to it in the refund claim. This court decided that there was an express waiver as to the form and contents of the claim and that counsel representing the government had power, prior to the expiration of the period of limitation, to waive the objection that the supposed basis for refund was not disclosed in the claim. In so holding the court adverted to the fact that the Commissioner was not deceived or misled by the deficiency of the claim and that it was in the interest of justice that in the circumstances the claimant be not remitted to the resort of filing a new claim and pursuing it through the Bureau and the courts. The opinion expressly recognized that no officer of the government has power to waive the statute of limitations and cited, in support of the proposition, Finn v.

Gen., and Fendall Marbury, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Messrs. R. K. Wise, of Columbia, S.C., and Warren E. Miller, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether the Economy Act1 repealed section 401 of the War Risk Insurance Act2 and thereby deprived veterans and their beneficiaries of 'automatic insurance.' \n\n[302 \nU.S. 628, 630]\n\u00a0\n In this suit, brought by the son of a soldier who died in service, both the District Court3 and the Circuit Court of Appeals4 were of the opinion that the Economy Act did not terminate the rights of a beneficiary of automatic insurance. We granted certiorari limiting consideration to the question of the repeal of the law providing automatic insurance. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n During the World War, it was the policy of the government to allow soldiers one hundred and twenty days after enlistment or drafting within which to apply for and purchase insurance. For this period, it was intended that they be protected as though they had bought government insurance. In furtherance of this policy, Congress provided that all veterans, who died or became totally and permanently disabled within one hundred and twenty days after their entrance into active service, should be automatically 'deemed to have applied for and to have been granted insurance.'\n It is here contended that the words of the Economy Act repealing 'other allowances' and 'laws ... pertaining to yearly renewable term insurance' are broad enough to include a repeal of automatic insurance. With this contention we cannot agree. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 628, 631]\n\u00a0\n Repeals by implication are not favored. A law is not to be construed as impliedly repealing a prior law unless no other reasonable construction can be applied. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n While the Economy Act explicitly repealed all laws which granted 'medical or hospital treatment, domiciliary care, compensation and other allowances, pension, disability allowance, ... retirement pay ... and all laws granting or pertaining to yearly renewable term insurance,' Congress did not include 'automatic insurance' in this detailed list of benefits repealed.\n The words 'other allowances' have a well settled meaning. 'Allowances,' in veterans' legislation, in the Veterans' Bureau, and in Army terminology,7 has never been considered synonymous with, or inclusive of, automatic insurance; this word ordinarily refers to extra and special items (in addition to regular compensation) such as nurse hire, training pay, and 'travel pay and allowances.' \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The words 'all laws granting or pertaining to yearly renewable term insurance' refer only to laws which are enactments upon the subject of yearly renewable term insurance. Section 401 did not grant yearly renewable term insurance, nor is it an enactment upon that subject. It provided for those soldiers who died in service before they had an opportunity to purchase yearly renewable term insurance or any other type of insurance. This law, therefore, did not pertain to yearly renewable term in- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 628, 632]\n\u00a0\n surance but to protection for soldiers who never had and never could obtain yearly renewable term insurance.\n It is to be remembered that automatic insurance applied to that particular group of American soldiers who either were killed, died, or became wholly or permanently incapacitated before they had a reasonable opportunity to obtain insurance of any kind. It may be that Congress did not believe it proper to economize at the expense of those veterans who came out of the army with health completely destroyed or to the detriment of the beneficiaries of soldiers who lost their lives in service without a reasonable opportunity to apply for insurance.\n Certainly the reason which prompted the passage of the express provisions of section 401 is such that, in the absence of subsequent legislation equally express, they are not overthrown by mere inference or implication. \n9\n Only clear and unequivocal language would justify a conclusion that benefits, provided by a grateful government because of death and permanent incapacity of its soldiers, are to be wholly withdrawn for reasons of economy. Special provisions benefiting either soldiers who became incurably helpless in the army or the dependents of soldiers who died or were killed in the service of their country cannot justifiably be repealed by implication. \n10\n There is no irreconcilable conflict between section 401 and the Economy Act and effect can reasonably be given to both. \n 11\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is therefore affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 17, Act of March 20, 1933, c. 3, 48 Stat. 11, 38 U.S.C.A.  717: 'All public laws granting medical or hospital treatment, domiciliary care, compensation and other allowances, pension, disability allowance, or retirement pay to veterans and the dependents of veterans of ... the World War, ... are hereby repealed, and all laws granting or pertaining to yearly renewable term insurance are hereby repealed, but payments in accordance with such laws shall continue to (June 30, 1933) the lst day of the third calendar month following the month during which this Act is enacted.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 401 of the War Risk Insurance Act, as amended Dec. 24, 1919, c. 16,  12, 41 Stat. 371, 375: 'Any person in the active service on or after the 6th day of April, 1917, and before the 11th day of November, 1918, who, while in such service, and before the expiration of one hundred and twenty days after October 15, 1917, or one hundred and twenty days after entrance into or employment in the active service, becomes or has become totally and permanently disabled, or dies or has died, without having applied for insurance, shall be deemed to have applied for and to have been granted insurance, payable to such person during his life in monthly installments of $25 each. ...

The taxable income was less than the profit in question. It resulted from the sale by him, April 11, 1929, for a net price of $240, 000 of stock bought in 1928 for $46,000. The buyer agreed to pay $25,000 cash and the balance in installments of $1,875 a month. For 1930, respondent and his wife filed a return showing no taxable income. For 1931 and 1932, respondent filed no returns. In 1932 he filed a claim for refund of the entire 1929 income tax. The ground for the claim was that he was entitled to report the sale on the installment basis. The findings indicate that the deferred payments were worth less than face value; after respondent and his wife (to whom he assigned the contract) had received $ 55,000, they agreed to accept $75,000 more as full payment.

Gen., and Carl McFarland, Asst. Atty. Gen., for appellant.\n Mr. G. Carroll Todd, of Washington, D.C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Congress, by Act of May 26, 1920,1 gave to the lower court jurisdiction of claims of respondents against the United States. They sued to recover the value of 87,000 acres of land alleged to have been taken from them by the United States August 22, 1906. The Court or Claims made special findings of fact, stated its conclusion of law, and dismissed the case. We affirmed on the ground that the Act did not confer jurisdiction of released claims and that this claim had been released. \n296 \nU.S. 244\n, 56 S.Ct. 212. Then, by Act of May 15, 1936,2 the Congress enacted 'That in the suit numbered E-346 (this suit) heretofore instituted in the Court of Claims by the Klamath and Modoc Tribes and Yahooskin Band of Snake Indians under an Act ... approved May 26, 1920, jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon said court, and it is hereby authorized and directed, irrespective of any release or settlement, to re- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 119, 121]\n\u00a0\n instate and retry said case and to hear and determine the claims of the plaintiffs on the merits, and to enter judgment thereon upon the present pleadings, evidence, and findings of fact, with the right of appeal, rather than by certiorari, to the Supreme Court of the United States by either party: Provided, That any payment heretofore made to the said Indians by the United States in connection with any release or settlement shall be charged as an offset, but shall not be treated as an estoppel.'\n The findings show: In 1864 plaintiffs held by immemorial possession more than 20,000,000 acres located within what now constitutes Oregon and California. By an Act3 of March 25 of that year the President was authorized to conclude with them a treaty for the purchase of the country they occupied. The treaty was made October 14 following. \n4\n A proviso sets apart a tract retained out of the country a part of which was ceded to be held until otherwise directed by the President, as a residence for plaintiffs, with specified privileges. Rights of way for public roads were reserved. \n5\n Shortly before the treaty was made Congress granted Oregon, to aid in the construction of a military road, the odd-numbered sections for three in width on each side of the proposed road. \n6\n Oregon accepted the grant and assigned it to the road company which undertook to construct the road. Congress recognized the assignment. \n7\n Patents were issued to the state and to the road company for in all 420,240.67 acres, title to which was later acquired by a land company. Exclusive of right of way, 111,385 acres so acquired by that company were within the boundaries \n\n[304 \nU.S. 119, 122]\n\u00a0\n of the reservation and had been allotted in severalty to members of the tribe. The United States brought suit but failed to recover that area. \n8\n Congress by Act of June 21, 1906,9 authorized the Secretary of the Interior to exchange unallotted lands in the reservation for the allotted lands by mistake earlier conveyed. He made an agreement with the land company pursuant to which, on August 22, 1906, it conveyed the allotted lands back to the United States and in return the latter conveyed to the company 87,000 acres of unallotted lands. That transfer was made without the knowledge or consent of plaintiffs and without giving them any compensation for the lands so taken from their reservation. Later, however, the United States paid them.$108,750 for which they released their claim. 10 There was then upon the land 1,713,000,000 board feet of merchantable timber of the value of $1.50 per thousand; the value of the lands including timber was $2,980,000. From that amount the court subtracted the.$ 108,750 and to the remainder added 5 per cent. per annum to date of judgment; from the total took the amount it found the United States entitled to set off against plaintiff's claim, Act of May 26, 1920, 41 Stat. 623, 624,  2, and as of June 7, 1937, gave judgment for the balance $ 5,313,347.32, with interest on a part of that amount until paid.\n\n 1. \nThe United States contends that the lower court erred in including the value of the timber. The tract taken was a part of the reservation retained by plaintiffs out of the country held by them in immemorial posses- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 119, 123]\n\u00a0\n sion, from which was made the cession by the treaty of October 14, 1864. The clause declaring that the district retained should, until otherwise directed by the President, be set apart as a residence for the Indians and 'held and regarded as an Indian reservation' clearly did not detract from the tribes' right of occupancy. The worth attributable to the timber was a part of the value of the land upon which it was standing. Plaintiffs were entitled to have that element of value included as a part of the compensation for the lands taken. United States v. Shoshone Tribe, \n304 \nU.S. 111\n, 58 S.Ct. 794, 82 L.Ed. --, decided this day.\n\n 2. \nThe United States also contends that the lower court erred in allowing interest against the United States on the unpaid value of the 87, 000 acres from the time of the exchange to the date of the judgment, and to support that contention argues that there was no exercise of the power of eminent domain and that the jurisdictional Act of 1920 limited recovery to the value of the land on the date of the taking, without interest.\n It is appropriate first to observe that while the United States has power to control and manage the affairs of its Indian wards in good faith for their welfare, that power is subject to constitutional limitations, and does not enable the United States without paying just compensation therefor to appropriate lands of an Indian tribe to its own use or to hand them over to others. Chippewa Indians v. United States, \n301 \nU.S. 358, 375\n, 57 S.Ct. 826, 833. and cases cited. Nor is it quite accurate to say that interest as such is added to value at the time of the taking in order to arrive at just compensation subsequently ascertained and paid. The established rule is that the taking of property by the United States in the exertion of its power of eminent domain implies a promise to pay just compensation, i.e., value at the time of the taking plus an amount sufficient to produce the full equivalent of that value paid contemporneously with the taking. Jacobs v. United States, \n\n[304 \nU.S. 119, 124]\n\u00a0\n \n290 \nU.S. 13, 16\n, 17 S., 54 S.Ct. 26, 27, 96 A.L.R. 1, and cases cited. The lands here in question are not the allotted areas making up the 111,385 acres that the United States conveyed by mistake and through error in the conduct of litigation, as its counsel here says, failed to recover. 11 Plaintiffs seek compensation for the 87,000 acres given to the land company in exchange for the allotted areas which the latter then owned.\n Having been informed of the failure of the United States to recover the allotted lands, Congress, by the Act of March 3, 1905, directed the Secretary of the Interior to ascertain 'on what terms the said company will exchange such lands (the 111,385 acres of allotted lands) for other lands, not allotted to Indians, within the original boundaries of said reservation.' \n12\n The Secretary having reported, the Congress by the Act of June 21, 1906, authorized him to exchange 87,000 acres of the tribes' lands for lands theretofore erroneously conveyed. The exchange having been consummated, Congress by Act of April 30, 190813 appropriated.$108,750 as compensation. That amount was paid plaintiffs in accordance with the Act; they gave the release here held valid, \n296 \nU.S. 244\n, 56 S.Ct. 212. The Act of May 15, 1936, 49 Stat. 1276, followed.\n The United States argues that the rule of just compensation does not apply because 'the tract was lost by mistake rather than taken by the power of eminent domain.' But as to the 87,000 acres here involved there is no foundation for that assertion. Unquestionably Congress had power to direct the exchange and for that purpose to authorize expropriation of plaintiffs' lands. The validity of its enactments is not questioned. The taking was to enable the government to discharge its obligation, \n\n[304 \nU.S. 119, 125]\n\u00a0\n whether legal or merely moral is immaterial, to make restitution of the allotted lands. The taking was in invitum, specifically authorized by law, a valid exertion of the sovereign power of eminent domain. It therefore implied a promise on the part of the government to pay plaintiffs just compensation. Jacobs v. United States, supra.\n The provision of the Act of 1920 invoked by the United States is: 'That if it be determined by the Court of Claims in the said suit herein authorized that the United States Government has wrongfully appropriated any lands belonging to the said Indians, damages therefor shall be confined to the value of the said land at the time of said appropriation.' Section 3, 41 Stat. 624. As shown above, the 87,000 acres were taken by valid exertion of the power of eminent domain. The taking was consummated pursuant to the Act of 1906; it was ratified by appropriation and payment under the Act of 1908. It implied a promise to pay just compensation. Clearly the lands in question were not 'wrongfully appropriated.'\n Moreover the Congress by the Act of May 15, 1936, intended to grant to the plaintiffs the right to have their claim for just compensation under the Constitution for the 87,000 acres judicially determined without regard to the settlement and irrespective of the release. \n14\n It spe- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 119, 126]\n\u00a0\n cifically directed the lower court to determine the claim of plaintiffs on the merits and to enter judgment thereon 'upon the present pleadings, evidence and findings of fact.'

Brown v. Pennsylvania Canal Co., D.C., 229 F. 444; Pennsylvania Canal Co. v. Brown, 3 Cir., 235 F. 669; Brown v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 3 Cir., 250 F. 513. It appearing that certain of the bondholders had not filed their claims and could not be found, the defendant was directed by the court to pay into its registry the money due to such bondholders, which was then placed in a designated depositary of the United States, in the name and to the credit of the court, pursuant to R.S .  995, 28 U.S.C.  851, 28 U.S.C.A.  851. On June 30, 1926, the fund was deposited in the Treasury of the United States as required by R.S.  996, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  852, 28 U.S.C.A.  852, in the case of funds paid into court and unclaimed for more than five years.\n In 1934 the present appellee, as Escheator of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, proceeding under the Penn- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 276, 278]\n\u00a0\n sylvania statutes which authorize the escheat of moneys paid into court where the persons entitled to them have remained unknown for seven years, petitioned the District Court to declare an escheat of the fund. The court dismissed the petition, without prejudice, on the grounds that appellee had not yet procured a declaration of escheat, which was deemed necessary in order to perfect the Commonwealth's title, and that the court was without jurisdiction to make such a declaration. Thereupon the Pennsylvania escheat statutes were amended, Acts of May 16, 1935, P.L. 195, June 28, 1935, P.L. 475, to confer upon the court of common pleas jurisdiction to decree an escheat of moneys deposited in the custody or under the control of any court of the United States within the Commonwealth. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[303 \nU.S. 276, 279]\n\u00a0\n The present suit was brought by appellee in the court of common pleas, No. 5, of Philadelphia county, upon a petition setting out the facts already detailed and praying a declaration that the fund had escheated to the Commonwealth. The United States appeared in the suit and moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that the state court was without jurisdiction to escheat moneys in the custody of the United States or of its courts. The order of the court of common pleas granting the motion was reversed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which held that the statutes relating to escheat of funds in the custody of federal courts conferred jurisdiction on the court to declare the escheat and was subject to no constitutional infirmity, since exercise of that jurisdiction involved no interference with the federal court and no attempted control over funds in its custody. Escheat of Moneys, in Custody of United States Treasury, 322 Pa. 481, 186 A. 600.\n The United States then filed an answer and upon a trial of the issues the court of common pleas gave its decree declaring that the fund had escheated to the Commonwealth and that appellee had authority to claim it, and directing him to apply to the District Court for an order that the moneys be paid to him as Escheator. The state Supreme Court affirmed so much of the decree as declared the escheat and authorized appellee to prosecute the claim of the Commonwealth to the moneys. 326 Pa. 260, 192 A. 256. From its decree of affirmance the case comes here on appeal under section 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U.S.C.A.  344.\n Section 996 of the Revised Statutes, as amended, 28 U.S.C.A.  852, directs that when the right to moneys paid into federal courts has been ad- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 276, 280]\n\u00a0\n judicated and they are unclaimed for more than five years, they shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States, in the name of the United States. It further provides: 'Any person or persons or any corporation or company entitled to any such money may, on petition to the court from which the money was received, ... and upon notice to the United States attorney and full proof of right thereto, obtain an order of court directing the payment of such money to the claimant, and the money deposited as aforesaid shall constitute and be a permanent appropriation for payments in obedience to such orders.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The Government does not, in pleading or argument, set up any right, title or interest in the present fund adverse to the unknown bondholders. It does not contend that the fund has been or can be escheated to the United States. It agrees with the contention of appellee, which we accept as correctly interpreting the applicable federal statutes, that the fund remains subject to the order of the District Court to be paid to the persons lawfully entitled to it upon proof of their ownership. But it insists here, as in the state courts, that the decree declaring the escheat is an unconstitutional interference with a court of the United States, an invasion of its sovereignty, and is an attempt, void under the Fourteenth Amendment, to exercise jurisdiction over the absent bondholders and \n\n[303 \nU.S. 276, 281]\n\u00a0\n the moneys, neither of which are shown to be within the state.\n While a federal court which has taken possession of property in the exercise of the judicial power conferred upon it by the Constitution and laws of the United States is said to acquire exclusive jurisdiction, the jurisdiction is exclusive only in so far as restriction of the power of other courts is necessary for the federal court's appropriate control and disposition of the property. Penn General Casualty Co. v. Pennsylvania ex rel. Schnader, \n294 \nU.S. 189\n, 55 S.Ct. 386; see Leadville Coal Co. v. McCreery, \n141 \nU.S. 475, 477\n, 12 S.Ct. 28. Other courts having jurisdiction to adjudicate rights in the property do not, because the property is possessed by a federal court, lose power to render any judgment not in conflict with that court's authority to decide questions within its jurisdiction and to make effective such decisions by its control of the property. Penn General Casualty Co. v. Pennsylvania ex rel. Schnader, supra; see Heidritter v. Elizabeth Oil-Cloth Co., \n112 \nU.S. 294, 304\n, 5 S.Ct. 135; cf. Buck v. Colbath, 3 Wall. 334, 342; Riehle v. Margolies, \n279 \nU.S. 218\n, 49 S.Ct. 310. Similarly a federal court may make a like adjudication with respect to property in the possession of a state court. Yonley v. Lavender, 21 Wall. 276; Byers v. McAuley, \n149 \nU.S. 608, 620\n, 13 S.Ct. 906; Security Trust Co. v. Black River National Bank, \n187 \nU.S. 211, 227\n, 23 S.Ct. 52; Waterman v. Canal-Louisiana Bank & Trust Co., \n215 \nU.S. 33\n, 43-46, 30 S.Ct. 10; Commonwealth Trust Company v. Bradford, \n297 \nU.S. 613, 619\n, 56 S.Ct. 600, 602; General Baking Co. v. Harr, \n300 \nU.S. 433\n, 57 S.Ct. 540.\n In this case jurisdiction was acquired by the District Court, by reason of diversity of citizenship, to adjudicate the rights of the parties. That function performed, it now retains jurisdiction for the sole purpose of making disposition of the fund under its control, by ordering payment of it to the persons entitled as directed by the federal statute. Beyond whatever is needful and appropri- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 276, 282]\n\u00a0\n ate to the accomplishment of that end, the jurisdiction and possession of the federal District Court does not operate to curtail the power which the state may constitutionally exercise over persons and property within its territory.\n The present decree for escheat of the fund is not founded on possession and does not disturb or purport to affect the Treasury's possession of the fund or the District Court's authority over it. Nor could it do so. Penn General Casualty Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra; United States v. Bank of New York & Trust Co., \n296 \nU.S. 463, 478\n, 56 S.Ct. 343, 347. At most the decree of the state court purports to be an adjudication upon the title of the unknown claimants in the fund by a proceeding in the nature of an inquest of office as in the case of escheated lands, compare Security Savings Bank v. California, \n263 \nU.S. 282, 287\n, 44 S.Ct. 108, 31 A.L.R. 391, with Hamilton v. Brown, \n161 \nU.S. 256, 263\n, 16 S.Ct. 585, and to confirm the authority of appellee to make claim to the moneys. It is subordinate to every right asserted and decreed in the federal suit and effective only so far as it establishes rights derived from them. Neither the nature of the suit in the District Court nor the federal statutes preclude transfer of or change in the interest of the unknown claimants, either by judicial proceedings in the state court or otherwise, pending final disposition of the fund by the federal court. Section 996 of the Revised Statutes, as amended, 28 U.S.C.A.  852, contemplates that changes in ownership of the fund may occur, since it provides that after the right to the fund has been finally adjudicated and it has been covered into the Treasury it shall be paid over to any person entitled, upon full proof of his right to receive it.\n Since the Government has not set up and does not assert any claim or interest in the fund apart from the possession acquired under the decree of the District Court and the statutes of the United States, it is unnecessary to consider now the effect on the decree of the state court of the fund's absence from the state, and the absence or \n\n[303 \nU.S. 276, 283]\n\u00a0\n nonresidence of the unknown claimants, if such is the case. All such questions will be open and may be raised and decided whenever application is made to the District Court for payment over of the fund.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As amended, the statutes provide:\n's 41. ...

MCGOWAN(1938)\nNo. 138\nArgued: December 17, 1937Decided: January 3, 1938\n\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 535, 536]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Homer S. Cummings, Atty Gen., and Wm. H. Ramsey, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a decree of the District Court, U.S. v. One Chevrolet Automobile, 16 F.Supp. 453, dismissing libel proceedings brought by the United States praying forfeiture of two automobiles used to carry intoxicants into the Reno (Nevada) Indian Colony. 1 The proceedings were instituted under title 25 U.S.C.  247, 25 U.S.C.A .  247, which provides in part:2\n'Automobiles or any other vehicles or conveyances used in introducing, or attempting to introduce, intoxicants into the Indian country, or where the introduction is prohibited by treaty or Federal statute, whether used by the owner thereof or other person, shall be subject to ... seizure, libel, and forfeiture.'\n\n Both courts below concluded that the Reno Indian Colony is not 'Indian country' within the meaning of this statute.\n The only question for determination is whether this colony is such Indian country. In this inquiry, both the legislative history of the term 'Indian country' and the traditional policy of the United States in regulating the sale of intoxicants to Indians are important. \n\n[302 \nU.S. 535, 537]\n\u00a0\n The Reno Indian Colony is composed of several hundred Indians residing on a tract of 28.38 acres of land owned by the United States and purchased out of funds appropriated by Congress in 19163 and in 1926.4 The purpose of Congress in creating this colony was to provide lands for needy Indians scattered over the State of Nevada, and to equip and supervise these Indians in establishing a permanent settlement. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The words 'Indian country' have appeared in the statutes relating to Indians for more than a century. \n6\n We must consider 'the changes which have taken place in our \n\n[302 \nU.S. 535, 538]\n\u00a0\n situation, with a view of determining from time to time what must be regarded as Indian country, where it is spoken of in the statutes.' \n7\n Also, due regard must be given to the fact that from an early period of our history the government has prescribed severe penalties to enforce laws regulating the sale of liquor on lands occupied by Indians under government supervision. Indians of the Reno Colony have been established in homes under the supervision and guardianship of the United States. The policy of Congress, uniformly enforced through the decisions of this Court, has been to regulate the liquor traffic with Indians occupying such a settlement. \n8\n This protection is extended by the United States 'over all dependent Indian communities within its borders, whether within its original territory or territory subsequently acquired, and whether within or without the limits of a state.' \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The fundamental consideration of both Congress and the Department of the Interior in establishing this colony has been the protection of a dependent people. \n10\n Indians in this colony have been afforded the same protection by the government as that given Indians in other settlements known as 'reservations.' Congress alone has the right to determine the manner in which this country's guardianship over the Indians shall be carried out,11 and it is immaterial whether Congress designates a settle- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 535, 539]\n\u00a0\n ment as a 'reservation' or 'colony.' In the case of United States v. Pelican, \n232 \nU.S. 442, 449\n, 34 S.Ct. 396, 399, this Court said:\n'In the present case, the original reservation was Indian country simply because it had been validly set apart for the use of the Indians as such, under the superintendence of the government.'\n\n The Reno Colony has been validly set apart for the use of the Indians. It is under the superintendence of the government. The government retains title to the lands which it permits theIndians to occupy. The government has authority to enact regulations and protective laws respecting this territory. \n12\n 'Congress possesses the broad power of legislating for the protection of the Indians wherever they may be within the territory of the United States.' United States v. Ramsey, \n271 \nU.S. 467, 471\n, 46 S.Ct. 559, 560\n\n\n When we view the facts of this case in the light of the relationship which has long existed between the government and the Indians-and which continues to date13-it is not reasonably possible to draw any distinction between this Indian 'colony' and 'Indian country.' We conclude that section 247 of title 25, supra, does apply to the Reno Colony.\n\n 2. \nThe federal prohibition against taking intoxicants into this Indian colony does not deprive the state of Nevada of its sovereignty over the area in question. The federal government does not assert exclusive jurisdiction within the colony. Enactments of the federal government passed to protect and guard its Indian wards only affect the operation, within the colony, of such state laws as conflict with the federal enactments. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n[302 \nU.S. 535, 540]\n\u00a0\n Under the findings made by the District Court in this cause, a decree of forfeiture should have been rendered against the automobiles involved. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed the cause is remanded to the District Court for action to be taken in accordance with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Certiorari granted \n302 \nU.S. 666\n, 58 S.Ct. 20, 82 L.Ed. --. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 39 Stat. 970. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Act May 18, 1916, 39 Stat. 123, 143. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Act May 10, 1926, 44 Stat. 496.

Gen., for the United States.\n Messrs. William Stanley, of Washington, D.C., and James E. Kelby, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the validity of the title of the United States to a part of Mare Island in San Francisco Bay, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 504]\n\u00a0\n which was reserved for public purposes by Presidential Proclamation in 1850, was selected by the Secretary as a navy yard pursuant to act of Congress, was reserved for that purpose by Presidential Order in 1853, and since 1854 has been so used.\n The lands in question are in the area acquired as a result of the Mexican War by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, July 4, 1848, 9 Stat. 922, which guaranteed the property rights of Mexicans in the annexed territory. The United States claims under deed to it in 1853 by Bissell and Aspinwall and another, who derived their title under grant of May 20, 1841, by Alvarado, Mexican Governor of California, to Castro, a Mexican citizen, of the island La Yegu (Mare Island) 'in all its extent.' Respondents claim under a patent issued by California to Darlington in 1857, purporting to convey the land in question as a part of the swamp or overflowed lands granted to the state by the Swamp Lands Act of Congress, Sept. 28, 1850, c. 84, 9 Stat. 519, 43 U.S.C.A.  982-984.\n Upon the military occupation of California during the Mexican War the United States military commander had proclaimed officially that Mexican land titles would receive due recognition by the United States,1 and article 8 of the Treaty of 1848 with Mexico declared that the property rights of Mexicans in the annexed territory should be 'inviolably respected.' After the admission of California to statehood, September 9, 1850, 9 Stat. 452, Congress adopted the Mexican Claims Act of March 3, 1851, 9 Stat. 631, which established a Board of Land Commissioners with authority, upon petition of those claiming under Mexican or Spanish grants of land in the annexed territory, to pass \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 505]\n\u00a0\n upon the validity of the grants. Right to a review of the Board's determination by the District Court, and the Supreme Court of the United States, was allowed the claimants and the Government. By section 12 of the Act of August 31, 1852, 10 Stat. 76, 99, the Attorney General was given authority over appeals from decisions of the Board adverse to the interests of the United States.\n Bissell and Aspinwall, the grantors of the United States, filed their petition before the Board, seeking confirmation of their title under the Castro grant of May 20, 1841. After hearing evidence the Board confirmed their title by decree of May 8, 1855. Upon appeal by the United States to the District Court for Northern California, the decree of the Board was affirmed. Appeal by the Government to the Supreme Court of the United States, allowed by the District Court April 1, 1857, was dismissed by the government in the same year. The decree of the District Court was not signed or entered until a decree nunc pro tunc as of March 2, 1857, was signed, filed and entered on April 15, 1930\n\n\n While the proceedings were still pending before the Board, the claimants, Bissell and Aspinwall, on December 15, 1852, executed a contract to sell Mare Island to the United States, and on January 4, 1853, for a consideration of $83,491, they joined in a deed to the United States, without covenants except for further assurance. The deed purported to convey Mare Island, 'including all the Tule or low land and marsh belonging to the same or which has ever been reputed or claimed to belong to the same. ...' On February 28, 1853, they executed a bond in favor of the United States in the sum of $200,000, conditioned upon the validity of their contract and the conveyance of 'the entire and absolute fee simple Estate in the said tract of land known as Mare Island.' The bond recited that they 'shall at all times hereafter indemnify and save harmless the United States against any claim or title \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 506]\n\u00a0\n to the said tract called Mare Island and its appurtenances which may be set up by or through any person or persons claiming under Victor Castro and his assigns,' and that they should 'also indemnify and save harmless the United States against any adverse claim or title in any other person or persons or body politic which may within two years from the date hereof, be made and thereafter be successfully established.'\n The 1857 California patent to Darlington was not recorded until June 6, 1879, when one Sawyer appears to have acquired the Darlington claim. See Sawyer v. Osterhaus, D.C., 212 F. 765, 767. The Secretary of the Interior having found that the lands in question were swamp lands within the Swamp Lands Act of 1850, the respondents in 1928 by mandamus compelled the Secretary to certify the lands for patent to the State of California. The court, in awarding the relief sought, at the same time declared with reference to the contentions made here, 'the mere issuance of patent to California determines no legal or equitable right of the United States in the premises.' Work v. United States ex rel. O'Donnell, 57 App.D.C. 309, 23 F.2d 136, 138.\n The present suit was brought by the United States in the District Court for Northern California to quiet its title. Respondents, by their answer, put in issue the Government's ownership of the lands in question and asserted their title as tenants in common under the Darlington grant. They specifically challenged the existence and validity of the Castro grant, the validity of the decrees of confirmation of the title of Bissell and Aspinwall, and any prescriptive title of the United States. They prayed, as affirmative relief, that their title be quieted, and in support of their prayer alleged that the lands in question were not embraced in the Castro grant and also were swamp lands which had passed to California under the Swamp Lands Act. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 507]\n\u00a0\n The trial court made findings of fact and reached conclusions of law in favor of the United States on all these issues. Upon appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and decreed 'that the United States has no title to the patented lands (in suit), and that the title is in and quieted in' respondents. 91 F.2d 14, 45. The Court of Appeals found that Alvarado, the Mexican Governor of California, had executed the purported grant of Mare Island to Castro, including the land in question, but made no finding with respect to the adverse possession of the United States found by the District Court. It held that the paper signed by Alvarado was incompetent evidence of the grant to Castro because of the lack of filing or recordation of the grant in the Mexican archives, see Berreyesa v. United States, \n154 \nU.S. 623\n Appx., 14 S.Ct. 1179, and that the decrees of the Board of Land Commissioners and of the District Court on appeal from the Board, confirming the Castro title, were null and void and worthless as evidence because the United States had purchased the interest of the claimants Bissell and Aspinwall while the proceedings were pending before the Board. It characterized the proceeding as collusive and the action of the United States in acquiring title during its pendency as breach of a trust duty assumed under the Swamp Lands Act to convey swamp lands to California, and as in effect a fraud upon the state. It rejected the contention of the United States that the pending Board proceeding for confirmation of the Castro grant withdrew the land in question from the operation of the Swamp Lands Act, which is the source of California's and respondents' alleged title to the land, and held that the reservations of the land made by presidential proclamations for military and naval purposes were ineffective, because California had previously acquired an inchoate title under the Swamp Lands Act. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 508]\n\u00a0\n Respondents renew here the contention made below, based on an elaborate review of the evidence, that the swamp or overflowed lands in question were below high tide and were not within the exterior boundaries of Mare Island as it was known at the time of the Castro grant, and so were not intended by the grantor to be, and were not in fact, included in the description of the grant. Resolution of this issue turns upon appraisal of the evidence and the inferences to be drawn from it. As both courts below have found against respondents on this issue, we shall not re- examine the evidence here. We accept the concurrent findings as establishing the fact that the lands in question were within the description of the deed to Castro. United States v. State Investment Co., \n264 \nU.S. 206, 211\n, 44 S.Ct. 289, 290; Shappirio v. Goldberg, \n192 \nU.S. 232\n, 24 S.Ct. 259; cf. Page v.

Chicago, R.I. & P.R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 378\n, 46 S.Ct. 236.\n Nor is the fact that a patent has issued to California, in obedience to the judgment in the mandamus proceeding brought by respondents in Work v. United States ex rel. O'Donnell, supra, decisive of any issue presented here. Upon the Secretary's approval of the survey of the land in question by the United States Surveyor General for the State of California, showing the lands to be swamp and overflowed at the date of the Swamp Lands Act, and the determination by the Secretary that the lands in question were then swamp and overflowed, it became his duty under the Swamp Lands Act, and under the Act of Congress of July 23, 1866, 14 Stat. 218, to certify the lands for patent to the State. See Tubbs v. Wilhoit, \n138 \nU.S. 134\n, 11 S.Ct. 279. But the adjudication in mandamus that it was the duty of the Secretary to issue the patent under these acts, and the issuance of it, determined no legal or equitable right of the United States \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 509]\n\u00a0\n in the premises. It remains open to the United States in this or any other appropriate proceeding to show that the lands did not pass under the Swamp Lands Act. United States v. Schurz, \n102 \nU.S. 378\n, 404; St. Louis Smelting Co. v. Kemp, \n104 \nU.S. 636, 641\n, 646 S.; United States v. De la Paz Valdez de Conway, \n175 \nU.S. 60, 68\n, 20 S.Ct. 13, and cases cited. See Work v. United States ex rel. O'Donnell, supra, 57 App.D.C. 309, 23 F.2d 136, 137, 138.\n We accordingly direct our attention to the question, deemed pivotal below, whether, as the Court of Appeals held, the confirmation of the title of Bissell and Aspinwall under the Castro grant by the Board of Land Commissioners was invalid, so that the United States neither reserved nor acquired a title valid as against the State of California and respondents who claim under her. In answering, it will be an aid to adequate understanding of the points in issue to consider first the effect of the confirmation by the Board, without reference to the alleged collusion and fraudulent action of the United States or any of its officers.\n The Swamp Lands Act of 1850 was effective to transfer an interest in the lands described in the act, only so far as they were part of the public domain of the United States and thus subject to the disposal of Congress. The act in terms purported to grant to the several states all swamp and overflowed lands located within their respective boundaries 'which shall remain unsold at the passage of this act.' Section 1, 46 U.S. C.A.  982. Section 2, 46 U.S.C.A.  983, made it the duty of the Secretary of Interior 'to make out an accurate list and plats' of the lands described by the act and to 'cause a patent to be issued to the State therefor.' The effect of these provisions was to invest the state in praesenti with an inchoate title to those lands falling within the description of the act, to be perfected as of the date of the act when the land should be identified and the patent issued as provided by section 2. Wright v. Roseberry, \n121 \nU.S. 488\n, 7 S.Ct. 985; United \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 510]\n\u00a0\n States v. Minnesota, \n270 \nU.S. 181, 202\n, 203 S., 46 S.Ct. 298, 303, 304. By its terms the Swamp Lands Act did not include swamp lands which the Government had sold, and it could not include lands which the Government had not acquired or free any of them of obligations to which they were subject when the act was passed. United States v. Minnesota, supra, \n270 \nU.S. 181, 206\n, 46 S.Ct. 298, 305.\n It is a familiar principle of public land law that statutes providing generally for disposal of the public domain are inapplicable to lands which are not unqualifiedly subject to sale and disposition because they have been appropriated to some other purpose. Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498, 513; Missouri, K. & T.R. Co. v. Roberts, \n152 \nU.S. 114, 119\n, 14 S.Ct. 496; Scott v. Carew, \n196 \nU.S. 100\n, 25 S.Ct. 193. This has been held to be the case even though the appropriation be afterwards set aside. Leavenworth, L. & G.R. Co. v. United States, \n92 \nU.S. 733, 741\n, 745 S.; Newhall v. Sanger, \n92 \nU.S. 761\n. The general words of the granting act are to be read as subject to such exception. Scott v. Carew, supra, \n196 \nU.S. 100, 111\n, 112 S., 25 S.Ct. 193; Louisiana v. Garfield, \n211 \nU.S. 70, 77\n, 29 S.Ct. 31; United States v. Minnesota, supra, \n270 \nU.S. 181, 206\n, 46 S.Ct. 298, 305.\n Swamp lands in California, being a part of the territory annexed by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, were subject to all obligations imposed upon the United States with respect to them under the principles of international law by reason of the annexation, and by its treaty obligations. \n2\n Article 8 of the treaty stipulated \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 511]\n\u00a0\n that Mexicans then established in the annexed territory should retain their property within that area, and that property belonging to Mexicans not established there should be respected. The protocol of May 26, 1848, interpretative of the treaty, which preceded the exchange of ratifications on May 30, 1848, declared that the grants of land made by Mexico in the ceded territory 'preserve the legal value which they may possess, and the grantees may cause their legitimate (titles) to be acknowledged before the American tribunals,' and that 'Conformably to the law of the United States, legitimate titles to every description of property, personal and real, existing in the ceded territories are those which were legitimate titles under the Mexican law in California ... up to the 13th of May, 1846. ... ' 61st Cong., 1st Sess., Sen.Doc. No. 357, pp. 1119-1120.\n The obligations thus assumed by the United States antedated the Swamp Lands Act and were superior to any rights derived from the United States under that act. The obligations were political in character, to be discharged in such manner and upon such terms as the United States might deem expedient in conformity to its treaty obligations. Beard v. Federy, 3 Wall. 478; Grisar v. McDowell, 6 Wall. 363, 379; San Francisco v. LeRoy, \n138 \nU.S. 656\n, 11 S.Ct. 364; Knight v. United Land Ass'n, \n142 \nU.S. 161, 183\n, 184 S., 12 S.Ct. 258. While the treaty provided that the claimants under Mexican grants might cause their titles to be acknowledged before American tribunals, it was silent as to the mode of selection or creation of such tribunals. The United States was left free to provide for them in its own way. Cf. United States v. Ferreira, 13 How. 40, 45. It could relegate all the multitude of claims under the Mexican grants to the ordinary procedure of courts with the inevitable delays and confusion affecting land titles in the vast annexed area. See Board v. Federy, \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 512]\n\u00a0\n supra, 3 Wall. 478, 493. It could set up an administrative tribunal acting by a more summary procedure3 designed to establish with finality the status of all the Mexican grants as of the date of annexation. It chose the latter course by the creation of the Board of Land Commissioners, by the Act of March 3, 1851, 9 Stat. 631.\n Under that act the General Land Office was required to issue a patent for all claims finally confirmed 'by the said commissioners, or by the said District or Supreme Court.' Section 13. The act declared that final decision of the Board, or the District or the Supreme Court should 'be conclusive between the United States and the said claimants only, and shall not affect the interests of third persons.' Section 15. Lands, the claim for which should be finally rejected, and lands, claims to which should not be presented to the Board within two years of the date of the act, were to be 'deemed, held, and considered as part of the public domain.' Section 13.\n The primary purpose of the Mexican Claims Act was the performance by the United States of its treaty obligations to quiet the titles of the claimants under Spanish and Mexican grants. But a necessary consequence of proceeding before the Commission, and one incidental to the determination of the validity of the titles of such claimants, was a determination whether, by the cession, the lands in question had become a part of the public domain of the United States. It is evident that the treaty obligations to quiet the title of claimants under Mexican grants would be defeated and the Mexican Claims Act would fail of its purpose if the finality of the Board's confirmation of claims under Mexican grants could be challenged by persons claiming under grants of public lands by the United States. For that reason it has been consistently held that claimants under the United States, by virtue of statutes disposing of its public lands in Cali- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 513]\n\u00a0\n fornia, are not 'third persons' within the meaning of the Mexican Claims Act, and that confirmation under that act of claims under Mexican grants is conclusive upon all those claiming under the United States. Beard v. Federy, supra, 3 Wall. 478, 493; More v. Steinbach, \n127 \nU.S. 70\n, 8 S.Ct. 1067; San Francisco v. LeRoy, supra; Knight v. United Land Ass'n, supra, \n142 \nU.S. 161, 184\n, 12 S.Ct. 258; Ward v. Mulford, 32 Cal. 365, 370; People v. San Francisco, 75 Cal. 388, 400, 17 P. 522; cf. United States v. Coronado Beach Co., \n255 \nU.S. 472, 488\n, 41 S.Ct. 378, 379. Such is the effect of confirmation by the Board of titles set up under Mexican grants, upon claimants under the Swamp Lands Act to lands in the annexed territory. That the Swamp Lands Act antedated the Mexican Claims Act and the confirmation of titles under it, is immaterial; for those claiming under the Swamp Lands Act took cum onere-subject to the treaty obligations of the United States and whatever procedure the United States might adopt in performance of those obligations for the quieting of titles under Mexican grants. Confirmation when made was as effective and conclusive upon all patents under the Swamp Lands Act as if made at the date of the treaty. San Francisco v. LeRoy, supra, \n138 \nU.S. 656, 670\n, 11 S.Ct. 364; Knight v. United Land Ass'n, supra, \n142 \nU.S. 161, 185\n, 12 S.Ct. 258; Ward v. Mulford, supra, 32 Cal. 365, 370.\n We do not stop to discuss the point, much argued at the Bar and in the briefs, whether the decree of the District Court affirming the Board's decree of confirmation was void or otherwise defective because not signed at or about the time it was rendered. See Mitchell v. Overman, \n103 \nU.S. 62, 64\n, 65 S.; In re Wight, \n134 \nU.S. 136\n, 10 S.Ct. 487; United States v. Stoller, D.C., 180 F. 910, 912, 913; International Harvester Co. v. Carlson, 8 Cir., 217 F. 736, 738. If it be taken that the Government has failed to prosecute its appeal to final decree in the District Court, it is enough that the decree of the Board has never been set aside or otherwise disturbed. If the appeal was not still pending when the decree of the District Court was entered nunc pro tunc in 1930, the de- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 514]\n\u00a0\n cree of the Board remains as effective as if no appeal had been taken, and has become final and conclusive within the provisions of the act. Beard v. Federy, supra; United States v. Ritchie, 17 How. 525.\n Apart from the considerations growing out of the purchase by the Government of the Bissell and Aspinwall title, now to be discussed, the decree of the Board, if not that of the District Court, must be taken as conclusive on respondents, and as to them it is not open to this or any other court to re-examine the existence or validity of the Castro grant.\n The holding of the court below that the acquisition by the United States of the title of Bissell and Aspinwall, while their claim was pending before the Board of Land Commissioners, involved a breach of equitable duty to California of such character as to preclude the Government from taking any advantage of the Board's confirmation of the Castro grant, is predicated upon the assumption that by virtue of the Swamp Lands Act the United States became in effect the trustee of the lands in question for the benefit of the state and its successors in interest. It is true that in a loose and general sense the United States, pending issuance of a patent under other land grant acts, has been referred to as a trustee of lands to be patented, Cornelius v. Kessel, \n128 \nU.S. 456, 460\n, 461 S., 9 S.Ct. 122; Benson Mining & Smelting Co. v. Alta Mining & Smelting Co., \n145 \nU.S. 428, 432\n, 12 S.Ct. 877; Orchard v. Alexander, \n157 \nU.S. 372, 383\n, 15 S.Ct. 635; United States v. Anderson, \n194 \nU.S. 394\n, 24 S.Ct. 716; Knapp v. Alexander-Edgar Lumber Co., \n237 \nU.S. 162\n, 35 S.Ct. 515; Payne v. New Mexico, \n255 \nU.S. 367\n, 41 S.Ct. 333, and the right of the state, before patent, to lands within the purview of the Swamp Lands Act, has been referred to as 'equitable,' Michigan Land & Lumber Co. v. Rust, \n168 \nU.S. 589, 591\n, 18 S.Ct. 208; Brown v. Hitchcock, \n173 \nU.S. 473, 476\n, 19 S.Ct. 485.\n Even where the right of the state under the Swamp Lands Act is unqualified, it would perhaps be more ac- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 515]\n\u00a0\n curate to say that the United States is no more than a donor granting without warranty those lands falling within the description and the purview of the statute, subject to a duty imposed by the statute, to perfect by survey and patent such inchoate title as it had conveyed to the state. Beyond this the United States, by the enactment of the Swamp Lands Act, assumed no duty. It gave no warranty of title. It assumed no obligations to the grantee subjecting itself to other claims of equitable duty. Sale of the lands to others does not make it accountable as a trustee of the proceeds. United States v. Louisiana, \n127 \nU.S. 182, 191\n, 8 S.Ct. 1047. In any case, the duty assumed by the United States under the treaty and the concomitant power thus reserved to it was inconsistent with the assumption of trust duties toward the state by reason of the Swamp Lands Act. In the execution of that duty it was free to adopt any mode of procedure it saw fit for adjudication of the titles of claimants under Mexican grants. Even after the submission of their claims to the Board of Land Commissioners it could withdraw them from decision of the Board and courts and adjudicate them by congressional action. Grisar v. McDowell, supra, 6 Wall. 363, 379. The tentative recognition by the treaty of the rights of the Mexican grantees and the full latitude which the Government had reserved to itself in the choice of modes of disposition of those claims, were incompatible with the assumption of trust duties by the Government with respect to them pending their final disposition. There is thus a complete absence of support for the supposed analogy between a sovereign government, in such circumstances, and a private grantor who has conveyed with warranty of title or who has undertaken by executory contract to convey title which he possesses or subsequently acquires and who, because he has thus assumed equitable duties, is sometimes spoken of as a trustee. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 516]\n\u00a0\n The Mexican Claims Act itself neither imposed nor recognized such duties. In authorizing the Board to pass on claims presented to it upon the evidence adduced by the claimant and the United States, it required no notice to be given to any third party. It gave to the Government the right to representation by an agent and made it his duty to collect testimony 'in behalf of the United States,' and to attend meetings of the Board. Section 4. But the role of the Government was not that of a litigant. It was rather, as the act itself declared, section 4, supervisory: 'to superintend the interests of the United States' in the performance, through an administrative agency, of its treaty obligation to ascertain for the Mexican claimants, and for itself, what lands had been withdrawn from the public domain by the Mexican grants. 'The United States did not appear in the courts as a contentious litigant; but as a great nation, acknowledging their obligation to recognise as valid every authentic title, and soliciting exact information to direct their executive Government to comply with that obligation.' United States v. Fossatt, 21 How. 445, 450, 451.\n At no stage of the Government's dealing with the titles under Mexican grants, either under the Swamp Lands Act or under the Mexican Claims Act, can we find the assumption on the part of the Government of any duty toward the state with respect to the swamp and overflowed lands other than that specified in the Swamp Lands Act itself, and that duty was fully performed when it issued to the state its patent to the lands in question in response to the mandate in Work v. United States ex rel. O'Donnell, supra.\n We turn now to the consideration of the circumstances relied on to establish the proposition that the title now asserted by the United States was acquired as the result of a purposeful or conscious scheme to deprive the state of possible benefits under the Swamp Lands Act by means \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 517]\n\u00a0\n of collusive proceedings before the Board of Land Commissioners and the District Court. At the outset it is to be noted that this contention first emerges in this case in the opinion of the Court of Appeals below. There had previously been no suggestion of such a contention in any pleading or assignment of error, nor had the Government or its officers been charged with any fraud, collusion, concealment, or bad faith. The respondents, in seeking affirmative relief, made no assertion of that character. In such a state of the record, dereliction of officers of the United States in the performance of official duty is not lightly to be inferred seventy-five years after the event, and a court should be slow to find what would be in effect a fraudulent conspiracy on their part to deprive the state of the benefits of the Swamp Lands Act.\n Upon the selection of Mare Island as a navy yard by the Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Crittenden, then Attorney General, had given an opinion to the effect that Mare Island was a part of the public domain subject only to the Castro grant, the claim under which was then pending before the Board of Land Commissioners. He concluded that there was sufficient basis for the claim to justify purchase of the claimant's title, which he recommended as a protection of the interests of the Government. See Opinion of Attorney General Cushing given to the Secretary of the Navy, April 9, 1853. 8 Op. Atty. Gen. 422. Then followed the purchase from Bissell and Aspinwall, in the circumstances already detailed. Those circumstances justify no inference that the defense of their claim was dishonest. The Government had far more to gain than to lose by defeating the Castro grant. As the grant covered the island 'in all its extent,' both upland and swamp, rejection of the claim would not only have given to the Government a return of the purchase price and expenses as guaranteed by its bond for title, but would have established its right to the entire island as a part \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 518]\n\u00a0\n of the public domain, except perhaps the swamp land. Cf. Newhall v. Sanger, supra. The validity of the Castro grant was the only matter with respect to which the Board could render a decree which, under the procedure of the Mexican Claims Act, could become final and conclusive as to the claimant and the Government. So far as appears, each was as much concerned with the determination of that question after as before the Bissell and Aspinwall deed and bond, for accordingly as it was decided one way or the other, the one or the other stood to gain an amount equal to the purchase price of the property. The reasonableness of the purchase price is not challenged. The only effect of the deed and bond was to protect the Government against loss of the opportunity to acquire the land for a navy yard in case the property should be disposed of to some third person pending the Board's decision, and the Castro grant should be upheld.\n Upon the opinion of Attorney General Cushing, already mentioned, the Court of Appeals placed its chief, indeed its only, reliance for the conclusion that there was conscious dereliction on the part of the Government. In this opinion the Attorney General spoke of the Government's purchase of the Bissell and Aspinwall title as an accomplished fact, but nevertheless recommended that the claim be vigorously contested. This is said to be so inconsistent with the Government's dismissal of its appeal four years later as to indicate a 'purposeful shift of position' to the detriment of the state, from which bad faith is to be inferred. But an attentive reading of the opinion in the light of subsequent events reveals no such inconsistency. In repudiating any thought that the claim should not be contested, he declared: 'But I, as Attorney General, in view of the special duties imposed on me by the acts for the settlement of private land claims in Cali- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 519]\n\u00a0\n fornia, and of my general obligation to look after the rights of the United States in the premises, cannot pursue this course. I must not admit that the purchase of the Castro claim by the United States operates in any way, either by implication or otherwise, as a waiver of the general rights of the United States in the premises, or as an assent, either express or implied, to the pretended validity of the grant to Castro.' He pointed out that the claim 'involves difficult and important questions of law, which the Commissioners, to be sure, have decided in favor of the claimants,4 but which the Supreme Court may decide otherwise,' and that he felt bound to protect the interests of the United States by an appeal because as a precedent the case would affect 'many millions worth of land in California, which is otherwise public domain.'\n After pointing out that the State of California retained title to tide land below high-water mark, and that the United States could not enjoy the use of Mare Island as a naval depot while its shores belonged to the state, he concluded with the recommendation that 'California be invited to relinquish to the United States whatever claim, if any, she may have to the shores or the overflowed land of Mare Island.' The opinion discloses that he had no thought of depriving the state of any rights which it might have under the Swamp Lands Act, for it affirmatively shows that he was of opinion (erroneously as was later decided in Beard v. Federy, supra, and cases following it) that no rights of California under the Swamp Lands Act would be affected by the decisions of the Board.\n With but little research it becomes apparent that the important questions of law affecting 'many millions worth of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 520]\n\u00a0\n land in California,' which were involved in the Bissell and Aspinwall claim and which the Commissioners had already decided in other cases, were unrelated to any rights of the state under the Swamp Lands Act, and were in fact decided against the Government by this Court after the Attorney General had rendered his opinion and before the dismissal of the Government's appeal from the decree of the District Court in the Bissell and Aspinwall case. \n5\n The opinion \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 521]\n\u00a0\n evidences the strongest motives on the Government's part to contest the Bissell and Aspinwall claim, and the firm determination to prosecute the contest with vigor. The record of the proceedings before the Board plainly shows adherence to this purpose. Witnesses were produced by the Government to discredit the Castro grant; those produced by the claimants, including Alvarado who testified to his execution of the grant, were so vigorously cross-examined as to excite the Board's 'strong suspicion' as to the authenticity of the Castro grant, which it nevertheless sustained in the light of all the evidence. Only after the 'important questions of law' had been decided by this Court against the Government did it relax its efforts. Its change of position then, though purposeful, can hardly be said to be evidence of bad purpose.\n The deed of Bissell and Aspinwall to the Government was recorded in Solano county, Cal., April 18, 1853. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 522]\n\u00a0\n The opinion of Attorney General Cushing was on October 3, 1853, transmitted by the Secretary of the Navy to the Governor of California, who submitted it to the California Legislature January 4, 1854. California Senate Journal, 1854, 37; Appendix, Doc. No. 4. Being then fully advised by that opinion of the Government's purchase of the Bissell and Aspinwall claim and of its purpose to press for a determination of the validity of the Castro grant by the Board of Land Commissioners, the California Legislature by Act of May 11, 1854, Cal.Stat.1854, c. 43, pp. 48, 49, consented to the purchase of Mare Island for the purpose of establishing there a navy yard and proclaimed that all the lands within its limits were to be perpetually free of state taxation. It ceded to the Government lands on the island which are not here involved, with the proviso that the consent to the purchase and the cession to the government should not 'be construed in aid or support, directly or impliedly, of any conveyance or bond for title to the United States of the same lands heretofore made, or which may hereafter be made ... or as a recognition on the part of the State of California of any claim, title or grant heretofore asserted or set up, or which may hereafter be asserted or set by any person or persons . ...' The only bond for title then relating to Mare Island which is disclosed by the record was that of Bissell and Aspinwall, and the apparent purpose of the proviso was that the state's consent to the purchase should not enure to the benefit of Bissell and Aspinwall or any others in like situation, so as to relieve them from the obligation on their bond in the event that the Castro grant should be held invalid by the Board of Land Commissioners. Occupation of the island by the United States as a naval station followed in September, 1854. The Board rendered its decree of confirmation of the Castro grant May 8, 1855. The following memorandum appears among the papers in the case in the district court: 'The United States being now the owner of \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 523]\n\u00a0\n the titles of appellees, a confirmation of this claim enures to the benefit of the Government and no objection is therefor made to a decree in favor of the validity of the claim.'\n Thus, instead of action covertly taken by the Government with the purpose of depriving the state of any of its rights in the premises, we find high officers of the Government proclaiming in documents submitted to the Government and Legislature of California the fact of the Government's acquisition of a conditional interest in the Bissell and Aspinwall claim, and its purpose to secure a determination of the validity of the grant by the Board of Land Commissioners. We see that, after this full disclosure, the state expressed consent to the purchase in such a way as to save to the Government unimpaired its rights under the Bissell and Aspinwall bond. Only after the conformation of the Castro grant by the Board of Land Commissioners, and only after the important questions of law on which the Government relied to defeat the grant had been decided against it by this Court in other cases, did the Government relinquish its purpose to contest the Bissell and Aspinwall claim. We can find in this record no basis for saying that the confirmation by the Board was procured or allowed to stand through any fraud, concealment, bad faith, or breach of duty to California by the Government or its officers.\n The contention that the decree of the Board is open to collateral attack as a nullity is thus reduced to the assertion that, by reason of the conditional interest of the Government under the Bissell and Aspinwall deed and bond, the contest before the Board may have been in some degree less vigorous than it otherwise would have been. To this the answer is that, as already shown, the Government owed no duty to the state to contest the claim and that in any case the proceeding before the Board was not adversary. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 524]\n\u00a0\n The Board was an administrative body, created as the act declares 'to ascertain and settle the private Land Claims in the State of California,' by proceedings which were not required to e controversial. It was begun without notice to any other party. While the attendance by the 'agent' of the United States was required in order that he might 'superintend the interests of the United States,' it did not appear in the role of litigant. United States v. Fossatt, supra. The Board was an administrative body, not a court. United States v. Ritchie, supra; United States v. Fossatt, supra. Review of its proceedings by direct appeal was not within the judicial power, and re-examination of its determinations by the District Court and the United States Supreme Court was sustained only on the theory that the appeal to the District Court was the initiation of a suit to set aside the determination of the Board, in the course of which suit further evidence might be taken. United States v. Ritchie, supra, 17 How. 525, 533, 534; Grisar v. McDowell, supra, 6 Wall. 363, 375. Since the statute under which the Board was created did not require adversary proceedings, the validity of its administrative determination was unaffected by their absence. The decree of the Board, which stands undisturbed by any subsequent proceedings in the courts, cannot be disregarded as a nullity.\n We conclude that the acquisition of the interest in the Bissell and Aspinwall title by the United States did not undermine that determination; that the proceedings in connection with their claim before the Board of Land Commissioners were free from fraud, bad faith, concealment, or overraching, and of any breach of duty to California on the part of the United States or its officers; and that the decree of the Board stands undisturbed as a valid administrative determination of the validity of the Castro grant and, as such, is conclusive upon the State \n\n[303 \nU.S. 501, 525]\n\u00a0\n of California and on respondents who claim under her. The decree below must accordingly be reversed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Proclamation to the Inhabitants of California, July 7, 1846, at Monterey, by Commodore John D.

This question was answered in the affirmative by the Board, December 27, 1852, in passing on the Fremont claim; January 5, 1853, in the Larkin Case; and in preliminary opinions in the Cervantes and Reading Cases, rendered August 3, 1852, and August 9, 1852, respectively. This Court agreed with the Board on the general proposition, in Fremont v. United States, March 10, 1855, 17 How. 542, 563; United States v. Reading, January 11, 1856, 18 How. 1, 7, 8; United States v. Larkin, May 12, 1856, 18 How. 557, 563. A special rule to the contrary was later pronounced as to island grants in United States v. Osio, 23 How. 273, decided March 12, 1860, but it cannot be said from the present record whether that rule was applicable to the Castro grant.\n Also involved in the claim of Bissell and Aspinwall were five other questions, each of which had been decided by the Board before the Attorney General's opinion of April 9, 1853, and before the Board's later confirmation of the Bissell and Aspinwall claim. Each was decided by this Court against the government before its dismissal of the appeal which it had taken April 1, 1857, from the District Court's affirmance of that confirmation. The questions were:\n (a) Whether the Mexican provincial governors had power to grant lands. It was decided in the affirmative in the preliminary opinion on the Cervantes claim, rendered by the Board August 3, 1852, and in a number of subsequent decisions, and was settled by this Court March 5, 1857, in United States v. Peralta, 19 How. 343. \n (b) Whether the Mexican governors had power to grant any lands within ten leagues of the seacoast-the so-called littoral league question. It was decided adversely to the government in a preliminary opinion in the Cervantes Case, rendered by the Board August 3, 1852, and was settled by this Court May 12, 1856, in De Arguello v. United States, 18 How. 539, and United States v. Cervantes, 18 How. 553.\n (c) Whether the grantee's failure to furnish a map (diseno) with his petition for a grant constitutes a fatal defect in title. It was decided by the Board adversely to the government in the Fremont Case, December 27, 1852, and was settled by this Court March 10, 1855, in Fremont v. United States, supra.\n (d) Whether a grant is void for want of a condition requiring the grantee to take possession of and cultivate the land within a certain time. It was decided by the Board in the negative in the Larkin Case, January 3, 1853, and was settled by this Court May 12, 1856, in United States v. Larkin, supra.\n (e) Whether a grant is void for want of a clause informing the grantee that it would become indefeasible only after approval by the Departmental Deputation. It was involved in the Larkin claim, confirmed by the Board January 3, 1853, and was settled by this Court May 12, 1856, in United States v. Larkin, supra.\n Chronological data have been secured from Hoffman's Land Cases, Appendix, and from the records filed in this Court in the cited cases. \n\n\n\n\n","179":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. PATRYAS(1938)\nNo. 445\nArgued: February 11, 1938Decided: February 28, 1938\n\n\n\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Wilbur C. Pickett, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. Warren E. Miller, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 341, 342]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n January 31, 1918, Stanley J. Patryas (respondent), then a soldier, purchased from the government a $10,000 yearly renewable war risk insurance contract which he permitted to lapse after his honorable discharge from the Army July 29, 1919. June 28, 1927, while a patient at a Veterans' Government Hospital, he obtained reinstatement of his war risk policy and immediately converted it into a five-year renewable term policy upon which he paid premiums to June 1932. Claiming total permanent disability, the veteran obtained, in the District Court, a verdict and judgment on his reinstated policy. Finding the issues for the veteran, the jury fixed the date of permanent total disability at 1924-a date three years before his policy was reinstated.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The government's right to contest this policy is limited by the following statutory provision:2\n'Policies of insurance ... issued, reinstated, or converted shall be incontestable from the date of issuance, reinstatement, or conversion, except for fraud, nonpayment of premiums, or on the ground that the applicant was not a member of the military or naval forces of the United States.'\n\n The question here is:\n Can the government, in the absence of fraud or bad faith, 'contest' and defeat payment of total permanent disability insurance, sold to a World War veteran, on the ground that the veteran was totally and permanently disabled before the policy was reinstated and converted?\n First. The government contends that 'Congress has \n\n[303 \nU.S. 341, 343]\n\u00a0\n not, ... authorized ... insurance benefits for total, permanent disability existing prior to any contract of insurance on which the claim is made.'\n The original War Risk Insurance Act of October 6, 1917,3 provided:\n'That in order to give to every commissioned officer and enlisted man and to every member of the Army Nurse Corps (female) and of the Navy Nurse Corps (female) when employed in active service under the War Department or Navy Department greater protection for themselves and their dependents , ... the United States, upon application to the bureau and without medical examination, shall grant insurance against the death or total permanent disability of any such person.'\n\n The War Risk Insurance Act must be considered in the light of its passage during war, while men and women were being called into war service. This requires recognition of its generous and liberal purpose to provide 'greater protection for (soldiers, sailors and nurses) and their dependents.' \n4\n Its passage indicated Congress conclusively presumed that every person, who had successfully undergone mental and physical examination for war service, was-when inducted into such service-insurable against death and total permanent disability. \n5\n The act commanded that insurance against death and total permanent disability be granted, without medical examination, to every applicant who had previously been examined and accepted for war service. Congress manifestly intended by these sweeping provisions that policies should be granted without regard to the health of applicants and should be enforceable obligations against the government. Any other construction of this broad, war- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 341, 344]\n\u00a0\n time legislative grant to soldiers, sailors and nurses would take away the benefits Congress intended them to receive. The provisions of the War Risk Insurance Act are sufficiently comprehensive and inclusive to authorize its administrators to grant insurance covering past or future total permanent disability, if such action is found necessary to carry out its far reaching national plan and purposes.\n Second. It is contended that the government can contest liability on the ground that the veteran was totally and permanently disabled prior to the reinstatement, despite the provision that such policy 'shall be incontestable ... except for fraud, nonpayment of premiums, or on the ground that the applicant was not a member of the military or naval forces of the United States.' It is urged that this provision 'has no application where, as here, the validity of the policy is not questioned and liability under it is denied solely on the ground that a loss has not occurred during the period of insurance protection.' However, it is admitted that this policy did not 'expressly exclude total permanent disability occurring prior to insurance protection as did the language of the original term contract.'\n This converted policy of insurance provided protection against loss from two causes: Namely, death and total permanent disability. A provision making a policy 'incontestable' except for certain clearly designated reasons is wholly meaningless and ineffective if, after proof of the loss insured against, the policy can be contested upon grounds wholly different from those set out in the exception. The object of the provision is to assure the insured that payment on his policy will not be delayed by contests and lawsuits on grounds not saved by the exceptions. \n6\n Here, it has been established that the veteran is \n\n[303 \nU.S. 341, 345]\n\u00a0\n totally and permanently disabled. Yet his policy is contested on the ground that it does not insure against this disability because it existed before the policy was issued. If this defense can be interposed, his policy has never actually protected him against total permanent disability. Since permanent total disability is one of the two risks insured against in the policy, any contest (not based on the exceptions) which may prevent the policyholder's recovery for such admitted total permanent disability- existing while the policy is in force-is a 'contest' forbidden by the 'incontestable' provision.\n No legal obstacle prevents parties, if they so desire, from entering into contracts of insurance to protect against loss that may possibly have already occurred. Marine insurance and antedated fire insurance policies frequently afford protection against risks which, unknown to the parties, have already attached. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Even with the benefit of scrupulous good faith, it is not always easy to determine with complete certainty whether or not total permanent disability exists. This uncertainty may lead an insurer, after his own investigation, and for adequate compensation, to treat unknown past and uncertain prospective disability, upon the same basis. This case is an illustration. Here, the government has never admitted that the veteran is totally and permanently disabled. It not only issued him a policy against such disability-with complete knowledge of his then condition-but in this continued contest has denied that the policyholder was totally and permanently dis- \n\n[303 \nU.S. 341, 346]\n\u00a0\n abled at any time-before, when, or after the policy was issued. There was also a sharp conflict of evidence on this disputed fact.\n When a policy of disability insurance is issued after complete examination by the insurer and full and fair disclosure by both parties, there is no legal reason why the insurer cannot contract to afford full protection against loss resulting from past as well as prospective disability. This veteran's policy did not expressly limit liability to prospective total permanent disability. The provisions of the policy in this regard contain a promise to pay the veteran 'in ... event of the total, permanent disability ... (and) Upon due proof of the total permanent disability while this policy is in force. ...' Original policies issued under the War Risk Act expressly excluded liability for total permanent disability incurred before the policy 'was applied for.' The deliberate omission, in the converted policies, of this previous exclusion, the language and purport of the original act and its amendments, the administrative interpretations and legislative history, all throw a flood of light on the intention to include liability for disabilities existing prior to the issuance of the policies.\n For more than a decade prior to 1934 (during which period this veteran's policy was purchased), the Bureau, unvaryingly observing the statutory mandate, announced and applied the practice that 'insurance was incontestable except for the grounds specifically enumerated' in the incontestable provision. A 'subsequent rating of permanent total disability effective as of a date prior to the date of reinstatement,' under this consistent administrative interpretation and practice, did 'not affect the validity of such reinstatement.' Because of court decisions and rulings by the Comptroller General tending to nullify and defeat this administrative practice,8 the Veterans' \n\n[303 \nU.S. 341, 347]\n\u00a0\n Administration urged the amendment of July 3, 1930, to confirm its practice and to strengthen and clarify the incontestable provision. For this purpose, the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs testified before the Senate Committee as to the necessity for this amendment:9\n'This is a very sweeping amendment and will place beyond contest many contracts and policies of insurance which otherwise would be contestable. It is a well recognized principle of commercial insurance companies, however, and in reality is only a clarification of the existing law which was practically nullified by a recent decision of the Comptroller General.'\n\n The Solicitor of Veterans' Affairs also testified:\n'... the present World War Veterans' Act of 1924 as amended, contains a provision to the effect that where a policy is maintained in force for a period of six months, it should be incontestable, except for fraud or nonpayment of premiums. We have followed that, and in all cases where the policy has remained in force for six months we have paid the claim, irrespective of the merits of it, unless there was fraud or failure to pay premiums. ... However, under date of January 16, 1930, notwithstanding the long practice of the bureau, the Comptroller General, in the case of Mabry W. Woodall, held that if a man was permanently and totally disabled at the time he applied for a reinstatement of insurance, or conversion of insurance, ... the policy was not incontestable, the statute did not protect it. ...'\n\n In the Woodall case referred to, the Comptroller General had held:\n'... if the insured was in fact dead or permanently and totally disabled, at the date of application, reinstatement or conversion, ... the insurance was subject to subsequent contest. ... \n\n[303 \nU.S. 341, 348]\n\u00a0\n Accordingly, the rule may be stated that where the Veterans' Bureau has heretofore established or may hereafter establish the condition of permanent total disability at or prior to date of original application for insurance, or application for reinstatement and\/or conversion of insurance , ... the insurance should be considered as invalid. ...'\n\n The Senate Report on this amendment10 stated:\n'The purpose is to make all contracts or policies of insurance incontestable from date of issuance, reinstatement, or conversion, for all reasons except fraud, nonpayment of premiums, or that the applicant was not a member of the military or naval forces of the United States. This incontestability would protect contracts ... where the applicant was not in the required state of health, or was permanently and totally disabled prior to the date of application, ... It is appreciated that this is a broad provision, but it was felt that it was necessary in order to do justice to the veterans, ... and to overcome decisions of the Comptroller General which practically nullified the section as it now exists.'\n\n The conclusion is inescapable that Congress enacted the 1930 amendment in order to overcome the effect of the above rulings of the courts and the Comptroller General, and with the intention to sustain the Bureau's previous administrative interpretation and practice under the incontestable provision.\n To resist payment of this veteran's insurance policy on the ground that he was totally and permanently disabled prior to the issue of the policy is to 'contest' payment within the generally accepted meaning of the word and violates the 'incontestable' provision. The purchaser of a policy contract containing a provision that \n\n[303 \nU.S. 341, 349]\n\u00a0\n the insurer waives its right to contest except for fraud, nonpayment of premiums, and lack of military or naval service is entitled to rely on the plain terms and inducements of the provision which limits the grounds for contest of liability to those specifically reserved. 11 The incontestable provision here means that a claim of a veteran whose death or total permanent disability is established shall not be contested except for fraud, nonpayment of premiums, or on the ground that the insured had not really been a member of the war forces of the nation or because he was included in title 38, U.S.C.,  447, 38 U.S.C.A.  447.12 Congress evidently believed these exceptions afforded the government ample protection against impositions or unjust claims and intended to limit the right to contest these policies to the specific grounds reserved in the exceptions. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 7 Cir., 90 F.2d 715, certiorari granted, \n302 \nU.S. 676\n, 58 S.Ct. 142, 82 L.Ed. --. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 307, World War Veterans' Act 1924, as amended July 3, 1930, c. 849,  24, 46 Stat. 1001, 38 U.S.C.A.  518. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 400, War Risk Insurance Act of Oct. 6, 1917, c. 105, 40 Stat. 409. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] See United States v.

SHOSHONE TRIBE OF INDIANS(1938)\nNo. 668\nArgued: Decided: April 25, 1938\n\n\n\n\n\n[304 \nU.S. 111, 112]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Carl McFarland, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Messrs. George M. Tunison and Albert W. Jefferis, both of Omaha, Neb., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Shoshone Tribe brought this suit to recover the value of part of its reservation taken by the United States by putting upon it without the tribe's consent, a band of Arapahoe Indians. The Court of Claims found the taking to have been in August, 1891, ascertained value as of that date, on that basis fixed the amount of compensation, and gave judgment accordingly. We held, \n299 \nU.S. 476\n, 57 S.Ct. 244, that the court erred as to the date of the taking, declared it to have been March 19, 1878, reversed the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. Then the lower court proceeded to determine the value of the tribe's right at the time of the taking, and the amount to be added to produce the present worth of the money equivalent of the property, paid contemporaneously with the taking. It heard evidence, made additional findings, and gave plaintiff judgment for $4,408,444.23, with interest from its date until paid. This Court granted writ of certiorari. U.S. v. Shoshone Tribe of Indians, \n303 \nU.S. 629\n, 58 S.Ct. 609, 82 L.Ed. --. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 111, 113]\n\u00a0\n The sole question for decision is whether, as the United States contends, the Court of Claims erred in holding that the right of the tribe included the timber and mineral resources within the reservation.\n The findings show: The United States, by the treaty of July 2, 1863, 18 Stat. 685, set apart for the Shoshone Tribe a reservation of 44,672,000 acres located in Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. By the treaty of July 3, 1868, 15 Stat. 673, the tribe ceded that reservation to the United States. And by it the United States agreed that the 'district of country' 3,054,182 acres definitely described 'shall be and the same is set apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation of the Shoshone Indians ..., and the United States now solemnly agrees that no persons,' with exceptions not important here, 'shall ever be permitted to pass over, settle upon, or reside in' that territory. The Indians agreed that they would make the reservation their permanent home. The treaty provided that any individual member of the tribe having specified qualifications, might select a tract within the reservation which should then cease to be held in common, and be occupied and held in the exclusive possession of the person selecting it, and of his family, while he or they continued to cultivate it. It declared: 'Congress shall provide for protecting the rights of the Indian settlers ... and may fix the character of the title held by each. The United States may pass such laws on the subject of alienation and descent of property as between Indians, and on all subjects connected with the government of the Indians on said reservations, and the internal police thereof, as may be thought proper.'\n The treaty emphasized the importance of education; the United States agreed to provide a school house and teacher for every thirty children, and the tribe promised to send the children to school. The United States also agreed to provide instruction by a farmer for members \n\n[304 \nU.S. 111, 114]\n\u00a0\n cultivating the soil, clothing for members of the tribe, and a physician, carpenter, miller, engineer, and blacksmith. It stipulated that no treaty for the cession of any portion of the reservation held in common should be valid as against the Indians, unless signed by at least a majority of all interested male adults; and that no cession by the tribe should be construed to deprive any member of his right to any tract of land selected by him.\n When the treaty of 1868 was made, the tribe consisted of full-blood blanket Indians, unable to read, write, or speak English. Upon consummation of the treaty, the tribe went, and has since remained, upon the reservation. It was known to contain valuable mineral deposits-gold, oil, coal, and gypsum. It included more than 400,000 acres of timber, extensive well-grassed bench lands and fertile river valleys conveniently irrigable. It was well protected by mountain ranges and a divide, and was the choicest and best-watered portion of Wyoming.\n In 1904 the Shoshones and Arapahoes ceded to the United States 1,480, 000 acres to be held by it in trust for the sale of such timber lands, timber, and other products, and for the making of leases for various purposes. The net proceeds were to be credited to the Indians. From 1907 to 1919 there were allotted to members of the tribes 245,058 acres.\n The court's finding of the ultimate fact is: 'The fair and reasonable value of a one-half undivided interest of the Shoshone or Wind River Reservation of a total of 2,343,540 acres, which was taken by the United States on March 19, 1878, from the Shoshone Tribe of Indians for the Northern Arapahoe Tribe, was, on March 19, 1878, $1,581,889.50.' That is $ 1.35 per acre for 1,171,770 acres, one-half of the reservation in 1878, at the time of taking. The United States does not challenge the principle or \n\n[304 \nU.S. 111, 115]\n\u00a0\n basis upon which the court determined the amount to be added to constitute just compensation.\n The substance of the government's point is that in fixing the value of the tribe's right, the lower court included as belonging to the tribe substantial elements of value, ascribable to mineral and timber resources, which in fact belonged to the United States.\n It contends that the Shoshones' right to use and occupy the lands of the reservation did not include the ownership of the timber and minerals and that the opinion of the court below departs from the general principles of law regarding Indian land tenure and the uniform policy of the government in dealing with Indian tribes. It asks for reversal with 'directions to determine the value of the Indians' right of use and occupancy but to exclude therefrom 'the net value of the lands' and 'the net value of any timber or minerals.\"\n The findings are unambiguous; there is no room for construction. The opinion of the Court of Claims may not be referred to for the purpose of eking out, controlling, or modifying the scope of the findings. Stone v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 380, 383\n, 17 S.Ct. 71; Luckenbach S. S. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 533, 539\n, 540 S., 47 S.Ct. 186, 188. Cf. American Propeller & Mfg. Co. v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 475, 479\n, 480 S., 57 S.Ct. 521, 523.\n In this case we have held, \n299 \nU.S. 476, 484\n, 57 S.Ct. 244, 246, that the tribe had the right of occupancy with all its beneficial incidents; that, the right of occupancy being the primary one and as sacred as the fee, division by the United States of the Shoshones' right with the Arapahoes was an appropriation of the land pro tanto; that although the United States always had legal title to the land and power to control and manage the affairs of the Indians, it did not have power to give to others or to appropriate to its own use any part of the land without rendering, or assuming the obligation to pay, just compensation to the tribe, \n\n[304 \nU.S. 111, 116]\n\u00a0\n for that would be not the exercise of guardianship or management, but confiscation.\n It was not then necessary to consider, but we are now called upon to decide, whether, by the treaty, the tribe acquired beneficial ownership of the minerals and timber on the reservation. The phrase 'absolute and undisturbed use and occupation' is to be read, with other parts of the document, having regard to the purpose of the arrangement made, the relation between the parties, and the settled policy of the United States fairly to deal with Indian tribes. In treaties made with them the United States seeks no advantage for itself; friendly and dependent Indians are likely to accept without discriminating scrutiny the terms proposed. They are not to be interpreted narrowly, as sometimes may be writings expressed in words of art employed by conveyancers, but are to be construed in the sense in which naturally the Indians would understand them. Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 582; Jones v. Meehan, \n175 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 20 S.Ct. 1; Starr v. Long Jim, \n227 \nU.S. 613, 622\n, 623 S., 33 S.Ct. 358.\n The principal purpose of the treaty was that the Shoshones should have, and permanently dwell in, the defined district of country. To that end the United States granted and assured to the tribe peaceable and unqualified possession of the land in perpetuity. Minerals and standing timber are constituent elements of the land itself. United States v. Cook, 19 Wall. 591; British-American Oil Producing Co. v. Board of Equalization, \n299 \nU.S. 159, 164\n, 165 S., 57 S.Ct. 132, 134. For all practical purposes, the tribe owned the land. Grants of land subject to the Indian title by the United States, which had only the naked fee, would transfer no beneficial interest. Leavenworth, L. & G.R.R. v. United States, \n92 \nU.S. 733, 742\n, 743 S.; Beecher v. Wetherby, \n95 \nU.S. 517\n, 525. The right of perpetual and exclusive occupancy of the land is not less valuable than full title in fee. See \n\n[304 \nU.S. 111, 117]\n\u00a0\n Holden v. Joy, 17 Wall. 211, 244; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Penn. R.R. et al., \n195 \nU.S. 540, 557\n, 25 S.Ct. 150, 1 Ann. Cas. 533.\n The treaty, though made with knowledge that there were mineral deposits and standing timber in the reservation, contains nothing to suggest that the United States intended to retain for itself any beneficial interest in them. The words of the grant, coupled with the government's agreement to exclude strangers, negative the idea that the United States retained beneficial ownership. The grant of right to members of the tribe severally to select and hold tracts on which to establish homes for themselves and families, and the restraint upon cession of land held in common or individually, suggest beneficial ownership in the tribe. As transactions between a guardian and his wards are to be construed favorably to the latter, doubts, if there were any, as to ownership of lands, minerals, or timber would be resolved in favor of the tribe. The cession in 1904 by the tribe to the United States in trust reflects a construction by the parties that supports the tribe's claim, for if it did not own, creation of a trust to sell or lease for its benefit would have been unnecessary and inconsistent with the rights of the parties.\n Although the United States retained the fee, and the tribe's right of occupancy was incapable of alienation or of being held otherwise than in common, that right is as sacred and as securely safeguarded as is fee simple absolute title. Cherokee Nation v. State of Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 48; Worcester v. State of Georgia, supra, 6 Pet. 515, 580. Subject to the conditions imposed by the treaty, the Shoshone Tribe had the right that has always been understood to belong to Indians, undisturbed possessors of the soil from time immemorial. Provisions in aid of teaching children and of adult education in farming, and to secure for the tribe medical and mechanical service, to safeguard tribal and individual titles, when taken with other parts of the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 111, 118]\n\u00a0\n treaty, plainly evidence purpose on the part of the United States to help to create an independent permanent farming community upon the reservation. Ownership of the land would further that purpose. In the absence of definite expression of intention so to do, the United States will not be held to have kept it from them. The authority of the United States to prescribe title by which individual Indians may hold tracts selected by them within the reservation, to pass laws regulating alienation and descent and for the government of the tribe and its people upon the reservation detracts nothing from the tribe's ownership, but was reserved for the more convenient discharge of the duties of the United States as guardian and sovereign.\n United States v. Cook, supra, gives no support to the contention that in ascertaining just compensation for the Indian right taken, the value of mineral and timber resources in the reservation should be excluded. That case did not involve adjudication of the scope of Indian title to land, minerals or standing timber, but only the right of the United States to replevin logs cut and sold by a few unauthorized members of the tribe. We held that, as against the purchaser from the wrongdoers, the United States was entitled to possession. It was not there decided that the tribe's right of occupancy in perpetuity did not include ownership of the land or mineral deposits or standing timber upon the reservation, or that the tribe's right was the mere equivalent of, or like, the title of a life tenant.\n The lower court did not err in holding that the right of the Shoshone Tribe included the timber and minerals within the reservation.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n Mr. Justice REED dissents. \n\n\n\n","181":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWAIALUA AGR CO, LTD. v.

P. Christian, an incompetent, to a one-third undivided interest in land on the Island of Oahu, Territory of Hawaii.\n The Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawaii in two opinions on separate appeals set aside the deed and refused to set aside the contract or lease. A decree was entered directing the reconveyance to the incompetent of her previously conveyed interest in the tract with adjustments for improvements. 1 The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit refused to review the first decree on the ground tht no final order had been entered. \n2\n Appeals were taken from the second decree by the incompetent and, after severance, by the Waialua Agricultural Company, Limited. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Supreme Court of Hawaii and remanded the cause to that court with directions to remand to the trial court, with instructions to grant relief against the deed upon restitution of the consideration and to take further proceedings in respect to the issues concerning the validity of the lease and contract. \n3\n The petition for rehearing was denied. 9 Cir., 94 F.2d 806. Certiorari and cross-certiorari were sought by the respective parties and granted by this Court to review the ques- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 94]\n\u00a0\n tions presented because of the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in reversing conclusions of the Supreme Court of Hawaii as to applicable principles of law. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The incompetent, Mrs. Christian, was born at Makaha in the Hawaiian Islands on December 30, 1885. She was brought to Honolulu by her father in the early 1890's. By 1901 they had gone to live with Mrs. Annie Holt Kentwell, a cousin and one of the nine children of Owen J. Holt. Except for short periods when the incompetent was in boarding school, they lived with her continuously thereafter. The incompetent's grandfather, R. W. Holt, had died in 1862 leaving a will which devised an equal undivided portion of the real estate involved in these cases to each of his three sons for life and then to the heirs of each in fee simple. One of these sons was John Dominis Holt, the father of the incompetent. The father was living at the time of the execution of the documents here questioned, dying in 1922.\n That portion of the grandfather's estate involved in these cases consisted of approximately fourteen thousand acres of land. At the time of the first transactions here considered, one of the sons, Owen J. Holt, had died leaving nine children, each entitled to a one-twenty-seventh interest in fee simple in the tracts. A second son, James R. Holt, was living but had conveyed his life estate to his son, James Lawrence Holt. This son had also purchased the contingent remainder of his brother, Robert Holt and the life estate of the incompetent's father, John Dominis Holt. Subject to whatever risk there was that his father, James R. Holt, born in 1838, would have other children after 1905, James Lawrence Holt was, in the year last mentioned, the owner of a one-third interest in the property, plus the life estate of his uncle, John Dominis Holt, in another third. James Lawrence Holt had transferred \n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 95]\n\u00a0\n all these interests to John F. Colburn as Trustee. The property in 1905 was 'wholly uncultivated and covered with noxious weeds, including such well-known pests as lantana and klu. The taxes at that time were four years in arrears.'\n On March 17, 1905, the administrator de bonis non with-the-will- annexed of R. W. Holt, several of the heirs of his son, Owen J. Holt, and the Hawaiian Realty and Maturity Company, Limited, executed a lease to the Waialua Agricultural Company, Limited, for twenty-five years at an annual rental of $9,000. The administrator was treated in this lease as having title to two-thirds of the whole. The owners of the contingent remainders, one of whom was the incompetent, joined with the lessors in covenanting that the lessee while paying said rent 'shall peaceably and quietly hold and enjoy the use and possession of said demised premises ...'\n On the 31st day of August, 1906, the incompetent entered into a contract for maintenance with her cousin, Annie Holt Kentwell. This instrument evidenced an assignment of her title and interest in and to any and all rents, issues and profits due or payable under the above lease or 'by virtue of being the only child of John Dominis Holt, the elder, and devisee under the will of R. W. Holt, deceased, together with all and every her right to demand, receive, collect and receipt for all such rents, issues and profits from whomsoever due during the term of' her natural life. The consideration for the contract was the assumption by Mrs. Kentwell of the support and maintenance of the incompetent. The instrument appears in a footnote. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 96]\n\u00a0\n A deed was executed on May 2, 1910, in which the incompetent and her husband, Albert Christian, her father, John D. Holt, and Annie Holt Kentwell, and her husband, were parties grantor and James Lawrence Holt was grantee. This deed, in consideration of $35,000, con- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 97]\n\u00a0\n veyed 'one undivided third part of interest' subject to the grantee's interest and to the lease of 1905. The deed evidenced the intention 'to convey all the interest of the said Grantors, whether present, prospective or in remainder, vested or contingent, of every name and description in and to said lands or which they or either of them may hereafter acquire in and to the said lands.' The deed further declared that the grantors assigned and set over to the grantee 'all claims and demands which they may have arising out of either of said instruments (i.e., the ones dealing with James Lawrence Holt's interests and the lease) or in any other way against the said James Lawrence Holt, the said Waialua Agricultural Company, Limited, or the said John F. Colburn, said Trustee' with exceptions not material here. The grantors further agreed to warrant the property conveyed against the claims and demands of all persons. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 98]\n\u00a0\n The grantee, James Lawrence Holt, and his trustee, John F. Colburn, conveyed the interest and rights acquired by this deed together with the other one-third undivided interest then belonging to James Lawrence Holt to other grantees. By successive conveyances the incompetent's property covered by the deed of 1910, came into the ownership of the Waialua Agricultural Company, Limited, a defendant in the trial court.\n Beginning at about the time when the tract came into the possession of Waialua under the lease, Waialua acquired, through various conveyances, fee simple interests of seven of the nine children of Owen J. Holt. When this action began in 1928, Waialua held in fee simple by color of title twenty-five twenty-sevenths of the property. Under the lease of 1905 it began to improve the property. The lease provided that the improvements would revert to the lessors. After the conveyances in 1910 of the life and remainder interests, covering two-thirds of the fee, Waialua made further important installations. Besides the forteen thousand acres of the Holt lands, the Waialua plantation includes an additional thirty-six thousand acres. The properties are developed and operated as a unit,-9,904 acres in sugar cane, 11,625 acres in pineapple, the balance uncultivated or used for servicing the crop lands. The record shows a total expenditure of $630, 722.12 for improvements on the Holt lands between April 1, 1905, and April 5, 1928, when Waialua was notified the deed was questioned. In addition reservoirs, ditches and other improvements, off the Holt lands but necessary for their use, have cost Waialua $514,594.94. No description is necessary other than to say that the improvements consist of reservoirs and ditches, roads, pumps, communication systems, camps, overseers' houses, and the other usual fixtures and appurtenances necessary for the operation of a large irrigated plantation. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 99]\n\u00a0\n After the lease had been in operation for a few years, it was found that some sixty-five hundred acres of the Holt lands were suitable for the growing of pineapples. After trying multiple subtenancy, an agreement was made in 1922 with the Hawaiian Pineapple Company giving it an option to lease all the Waialua pineapple lands at $15 per acre. Under the option Waialua invested over three million dollars in the Pineapple Company stock and the Pineapple Company leased 6,475 acres of the Holt lands for seventeen and one-half years from January 1, 1923, to June 30, 1940, with optional extension, at a paid up rental, reached by a 5% discount, of about two million dollars.\n The mechanized scientific farming of the sugar cane and pineapple lands was profitable. The trial court found that $14 per acre was a reasonable ground rent for the Holt land used for sugar production and that $15 per acre was a reasonable ground rent for the pineapple lands after the lease to the Hawaiian Pineapple Company of January 1, 1923. A less sum per acre was found as a reasonable ground rent for the pineapple lands prior to that time.\n In 1926 the ward was for the first time declared incompetent and Annie Holt Kentwell was appointed her guardian in England. In 1927 Mrs. Kentwell's brother, George H. Holt, became guardian of the estate of the ward in Honolulu. The present guardian, Herman V. VonHolt, succeeded him pendente lite. On May 9, 1928, a petition was filed against Waialua and James Lawrence Holt in the Circuit Court of the Territory by the guardian alleging the incompetency of the ward on the date of the execution of the deed; and that the purported consideration was inadequate and was never received by the ward. No complaint was made of the execution of the lease or the contract for maintenance. It was alleged that Waialua induced James Lawrence Holt, the grantee \n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 100]\n\u00a0\n in the deed, to secure the conveyance of the property through Holt's connection with Annie Holt Kentwell, the dominating influence over the incompetent. The guardian prayed for the cancellation of the deed and an accounting for the rental value of the undivided one-third interest from April 10, 1922, the date of the death of the ward's father. James Lawrence Holt appeared and admitted the facts relating to his part in the transaction.\n The trial court on adequate evidence found that Eliza Christian was incompetent at the time of the execution of the deed of 1910; that her incompetence had not been adjudicated by a proper protective proceeding, was not 'clearly self-evident to an entire stranger' but 'was known to James L. Holt, to her father, John Dominis Holt, to the Kentwells and to others who were familiar with her dependency upon the Kentwells.' The court found the price inadequate and that it was not clearly shown that Waialua Company had actual notice of the incompetency of Eliza. The decree set aside the deed and entered an award for $540,906.07 in rentals, after deducting the purchase price of $30,000 and interest.\n On appeal the Supreme Court of Hawaii sustained the determination of the trial court as to the capacity of the incompetent at the date of the execution of the deed, finding that 'she was a congenital imbecile.' It assume that the Waialua Company 'had no knowledge of Eliza Christian's incompetency.' It held that the consideration was adequate; that there was no laches; and that limitation did not bar the proceeding. It affirmed the action of the trial court in setting aside the deed of May 2, 1910, upon a repayment to Waialua by the incompetent of the purchase price, with interest from May 2, 1910, on a balance of equities, a consideration of the advantages to the incompetent and a suggestion that the consideration did not reach the grantor. The decree of the trial court as to the recovery of the rentals was re- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 101]\n\u00a0\n versed on the ground that Waialua had succeeded to Annie Kentwell's rights under the contract of 1906 to receive and keep the incompetent's rentals during the term of the lease. Rentals beyond the termination of the lease were not involved in the first appeal. The case was therefore remanded to the trial court to determine the validity of the lease of 1905 and the contract of 1906.\n On the remand the trial court found that Eliza was incompetent at the time of the execution of the contract, that Mrs. Kentwell knew of the incompetency and that Waialua was not an innocent purchaser from Mrs. Kentwell, since it knew of a secret profit, received by James Lawrence Holt and John F. Colburn in connection with the various conveyances by which Mrs. Kentwell's interests passed to Waialua, 'while these two, at the same time, knew of the mental condition of Eliza Christian.' In considering the lease of March 17, 1905, the court found that Eliza was incompetent when she gave her assent; but that while the 'Waialua Company , ... is not shown to have had any knowledge of this incompetency', a balance of equities required a conclusion against the validity of the lease. The decree again set aside the deed of May 2, 1910; awarded rentals in the total sum of $606,785.75; annulled the lease of March 17, 1905, in so far as it affected the incompetent; annulled the contract for support and maintenance of August 31, 1906, and gave to Waialua the right to continue in the exclusive use and occupation of reservoirs, pumping stations, irrigation ditches and other improvements until partition or other arrangements were agreed upon. Appeal was taken from this decree.\n In its second hearing, the Supreme Court of Hawaii maintained its finding as to the incompetency of Eliza at the time of the execution of the deed of May 2, 1910. It assumed that the trial court was correct in finding Eliza incompetent at the time of the execution of the lease of \n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 102]\n\u00a0\n 1905 and the contract for maintenance of 1906, and accepted the finding of the trial court that Waialua was not shown to have any knowledge of Eliza's incompetency at the time it took the lease of 1905. It determined that the deed of May 2, 1910, passed the contract rights assigned to Annie by Eliza and that Waialua succeeded to these rights as an innocent purchaser for value. It further held that the incompetent received an adequate consideration for the lease of 1905. In effect it held that the assignment of 1906 was also for an adequate consideration already largely received. The contract 'was beneficial to Eliza.' 'Eliza had no income or other means of support.' 'In entering into this contract (1906) neither of the parties knew or could know how long a period of time would elapse before Eliza would become entitled to a share of the rents under the lease ....'6\n In the final decree the deed of May 2, 1910, was set aside; the lease of 1905 and the contract of 1906 were sustained; the incompetent was required to pay or secure the payment to Waialua of the purchase price; Waialua was required to convey to the incompetent the one-third interest in fee simple which passed by the deed, with reservations by Waialua of certain portions occupied by its improvements and certain lands and rights of way for ditches, pipes, service, and roads necessary to maintain and distribute water and operate the plantation, and with provisions to insure to the incompetent rights of way for the operation of her properties, if and when the same were partitioned and set off.\n We might summarize the factual situation arising from the two trials in the lower court and the two reviews in the Supreme Court of Hawaii as follows: Eliza Christian was found or assumed to have been incompetent at the time of the execution of the lease of 1905, the contract of 1906 and the deed of 1910. Waialua was not found to \n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 103]\n\u00a0\n have known of this incompetency at the time it received any rights flowing from any of the instruments. It was determined that the status quo was restored in so far as the deed was concerned by the repayment of the purchase price with interest and that the Holt land could be separated from the rest of the plantation with proper adjustment for improvements.\n Upon these facts the Supreme Court of Hawaii determined applicable principles of law. Those considered by the Circuit Court of Appeals were the following:\n I. The rule of law in Hawaii is that the deed, lease or contract of an incompetent executed prior to a judicial declaration of incompetency is voidable. A mere showing of incompetency will not avoid it. In determining whether it should be canceled, 'all of the equities must be considered, including those in favor of the grantee or lessee as well as those in favor of the grantor or lessor.' \n7\n\u00a0\n\n'it is our view of the law that a lease made by an incompetent, who has not been judicially declared insane, to a lessee without knowledge of the incompetency, for an adequate rental and upon other terms that are reasonable and fair, which is beneficial to the incompetent and is in effect a provision in favor of the incompetent for necessaries for his sustenance and comfort,-a lease which has been fully performed and is accompanied by no fraud or other circumstances of inequity to the incompetent,-should not be canceled,-even though the lessee can be restored to the status quo ante.'8\n\n In its first opinion the court had said. 'When the grantee can be restored to the position it occupied immediately prior to the conveyance, the deed of the incompetent should be canceled even though it was taken in \n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 104]\n\u00a0\n ignorance of the incompetency and even though the consideration paid was adequate.' \n9\n\u00a0\n\n It did not refer in the second opinion to any conflict between the statements but found the distinction between the canceled deed and the confirmed lease and contract, in the relative advantages to the incompetent. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n II. The construction of the contract for maintenance of 190611 was that it covered rents, issues and profits, payable to the incompetent not only from the lessee under the 1905 lease but also 'the rents accruing thereafter from whatever source.' \n12\n This ruling was embodied in the language of the final decree set out in the note below. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n'By the deed of May 2, 1910, Annie Kentwell, a mentally competent person, transferred all of her rights under the instrument of 1906 to' Waialua.14\n\n III. A court of equity may permit a grantee without notice of the incompetency, who has placed improvements on the land of an incompetent in reliance on a conveyance subsequently canceled, to reserve the improvements together with such land and rights of way over the incom- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 105]\n\u00a0\n petent's lands as may be necessary for their proper use under suitable conditions to be prescribed by the court. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n While the Circuit Court of Appeals accepted the findings of fact in the trial and appellate courts of Hawaii,16 it took direct issue with some of the legal conclusions of the supreme court of the Territory and held as follows:\n I. The general rule of law is that the deed, lease or indenture17 of an incompetent, executed prior to a judicial declaration to that effect, is void. 'Relief against such a contract should not be granted, however, on proof of incompetency only.' 'So, in the case of a contract made by an incompetent, after proof of the incompetency, relief will be granted against the contract, or refused, depending upon the situation of the parties at the time relief is asked; in other words the situation of the parties is the controlling factor.' 18 'This ... does not mean that the court should balance all equities of the parties, as was done by the trial court.' \n19\n 'The rule as stated means that if the parties can be placed in statu quo, the relief will be granted.' 20 This rule was held applicable to Hawaii.\n Apparently in reliance on this rule, the lower court determined relief should be granted against the lease as to the lessor, Eliza Christian, or against the contract or against both, if she were incompetent at the time of the execution. 21 The territorial supreme court had denied relief 'irrespective of the subject of status quo' and of competency. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 106]\n\u00a0\n II. The construction of the contract of maintenance of 1906 is that the incompetent assigned to Mrs. Kentwell her rents, issues and profits under the lease of 1905 only; that later rents, issues and profits were retained. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n III. The action of the territorial supreme court, in adjusting equities as to improvements by cross conveyances between the incompetent and the subsequent grantees, is incorrect.\n'Here, if the company is entitled to an allowance for improvements at all, it is entitled to an allowance of one-third of the enhanced value of the land, due solely to the addition of improvements since May 2, 1910. That amount may be made a lien against the land, or may be set-off against the rentals, if any, which are found due to the ward.'24\n\n Status of the Supreme Court of Hawaii.-The lower court acquired jurisdiction of the appeals under Judicial Code, section 128.25 When the Hawaiian Organic Act was passed in 1900, no provision was made for appeals from the territorial supreme court. In 1905, for matters involving more than $5,000, a direct appeal to this Court was provided. \n26\n In 1911 review of the territorial supreme court was placed upon the same basis as review of the highest court of a State, with a continued right of review, generally, where the amount involved $5,000.27 Certiorari from this Court was provided by the Act of January 28, 1915, and for the first time review by circuit \n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 107]\n\u00a0\n courts of appeals for cases involving $5,000 or over. \n28\n In each of these successive enactments the Congress has recognized, to some degree, the autonomous position of the Supreme Court of the Territory.\n This recognition is natural. The territorial court has general appellate jurisdiction of cases involving the mores and statutes of an archipelago, the first known compilation of whose laws appeared in 1842.29 Isolated until the day of electrical communication and aerial transportation from continuous contact with other peoples, and inhabited by diverse stocks of Oceanica, Asia, Europe and America, it developed, as an independent kingdom, a jurisprudence adapted to its needs. The constitution of Kamehameha III established a Supreme Court of the Kingdom in 1840 and defined its jurisdiction. \n30\n The common law and the civil law were sources of information but not of authority. \n31\n Until 1892,32 lacunae were filled by the judges. \n33\n The laws developed were largely \n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 108]\n\u00a0\n left in force by the Organic Act. \n34\n These now include a declaratory statute on the source of Hawaiian law. \n35\n This judicial tradition gives present substance to the rule of this Court that deference will be paid the understanding of territorial courts on matters of local concern. \n36\n\u00a0\n\n Review of its Decisions.-While the determinations made by the territorial court upon the validity of instruments executed by incompetents, the interpretation of the contract of an incompetent, and the adjustments of equities concerning improvements after cancellation of a \n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 109]\n\u00a0\n conveyance, partake of general law, as well as of local law,37 we see no reason for not applying the rule as to local matters to these circumstances. While the 34th section of the Judiciary Act is not applicable to territories, the arguments of policy in favor of having the state courts declare the law of the state are applicable to the question of whether or not territorial courts should declare the law of the territories with the least possible interference. \n38\n It is true that under the appeal statute the lower court had complete power to reverse any ruling of the territorial court on law or fact39 but we are of the opinion that this power should be exercised only in cases of manifest error. The differentiations, implicit and explicit, in the opinions of the Supreme Court of Hawaii, as to the rules of law applicable to the proceedings to set aside the deed of 1910 and those applicable to similar proceedings as to the lease of 1905 and the contract for maintenance of 1906, do not furnish occasion for reversal by the lower court. \n40\n In so far as the decisions of the Supreme Court of Hawaii are in conformity with the Constitution and applicable statutes of the United States and are not manifestly erroneous in their statement or application of governing principles, they are to be accepted as stating the law of the Territory. Unless there is clear departure from ordinary legal principles, the preference of a federal court as to the correct rule of general or local law should not be imposed upon Hawaii.\n Decision of the Supreme Court of Hawaii.-To adopt the legal principles applied by the territorial supreme \n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 110]\n\u00a0\n court in these cases as rules of decision in that jurisdiction, or to construe instruments as it interpreted them, is not manifest error.\n Whatever may be the better rule as to the voidableness of the transfer documents of an incompetent, it is not clearly wrong to select the one here chosen. \n41\n\u00a0\n\n The construction of the contract of maintenance by the territorial court of last resort is likewise defensible. The lower court, itself, said the assignment of rents due to the incompetent 'by virtue of being ... devisee under the will ... during the term of the natural life of' her the incompetent (see note 5, supra), might mean 'that the ward assigned all rents including those to which she might be entitled under the lease to the company and any other lease.' \n42\n The minority opinion reached this conclusion. \n43\n Although on consideration of the entire contract the majority reached a different answer, the interpretation of the Supreme Court of Hawaii is not manifestly erroneous. Nor do we see any occasion to reexamine the interpretation that the deed of May 2, 1910 (the relevant portions of which are set out above, (page 4)), conveyed the rents, issues and profits, assigned to Mrs. Kentwell. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 91, 111]\n\u00a0\n The lower court considered it necessary to apply here the rule that the occupant of the land of another was entitled to be paid, as compensation for improvements, a sum equal to the amount by which the improvements increased the value of the property, not exceeding the cost. It is not always necessary so to penalize an innocent improver. If he is a tenant in common, partition may be made so as to set apart to him the portion improved. \n44\n Under the circumstances here disclosed, the action of the Hawaiian court in awarding to Waialua the realty and improvements described in the decree need not be set aside.\n Decree of the lower court reversed and decree of the Supreme Court of Hawaii affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Christian v.

Const. Amend. 14.\n The statute of Wisconsin in force in 1933 and since imposes a tax on net income at graduated rates. Wisconsin Stat. 1933, c. 71. Appellant, a resident of Wisconsin, received in 1933 gross income of $13,383.26, of which $12,156.10 was dividends received from corporations whose 'principal business' was 'attributable to Wisconsin' within the meaning of the taxing statute. By  71.04(4), Wisconsin Stat.1933,1 such dividends were deductible from gross income in computing net taxable income, together with other items, including taxes, interest paid, business expenses, losses from the sale of securities, and donations, aggregating, in the case of appellant, $11,161.97, so that he had no taxable net income for the year 1933.\n Petitioner's income tax return was due and filed March 15, 1934. A year later c. 15 of the Laws of Wisconsin for 1935, effective March 27, 1935, laid new taxes for the years 1933 and 1934 upon various taxable subjects. Sec- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 142]\n\u00a0\n tion 6, with which we are alone concerned, imposed a graduated tax, with no deduction except the sum of $750, on all dividends received in 1933 which, when received, were deductible from gross income under  71.04(4). The statute declared that the levy was an emergency tax to provide revenue for relief purposes and directed that the proceeds should be paid into the state treasury to be used for 'unemployment relief purposes.' Appellant paid the tax, amounting to $545.71, under protest, on May 13, 1935, and brought the present suit to compel its restitution as exacted in violation of the state constitution and the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. From the judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin sustaining the tax, 226 Wis. 595, 277 N.W. 183, the case comes here on appeal.  237 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  344, 28 U.S.C.A.  344.\n First. Appellant assails the statute as a denial of equal protection because the dividends which it selected for taxation as a special class were subjected ratably to a tax burden different from that borne by other types of income for the same year by reason of the fact that the dividends were taxed at a different rate from that applied to other income and were given the benefit of but a single deduction of $750, while recipients of other types of income in that year were permitted to deduct specified items of interest, taxes, business losses and donations. It is not contended that the receipt of dividends from corporations is not subject to tax, or that apart from the retroactive application of the tax they could not be included in gross income for the purpose of arriving at net taxable income, but it is insisted that disparities in the tax burdens which may result from the different rates and deductions infringe the constitutional immunity.\n Wisconsin income tax legislation has from the beginning treated dividends received from corporations deriv- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 143]\n\u00a0\n ing a substantial part of their income from business carried on within the State, on which the corporations have paid a tax to the State, as a distinct class of income for tax purposes. At first complete tax immunity was granted to them.  1, c. 658, Laws of Wisconsin, 1911. Later the immunity was allowed ratably in the same proportion that the income of the corporation had been subjected to state income tax.  1, c. 318, Laws of Wisconsin, 1923. And, finally, by amendment adopted in 19272 and in force in 1933 complete immunity of dividends from income tax was allowed if 50% or more of the total net income of the corporation paying them was included in the computation of the Wisconsin tax on corporate income. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n When in 1935 the State was confronted with the necessity of raising revenue to meet the demand for unemployment relief, and of distributing the cost among its taxpayers, the legislature found one class of untaxed income, dividends received from a specified category of corporations. It also could have concluded that a substantial part of this income had borne no tax burden at its source in the earnings of the corporations, since, by  71.02(3)(d), corporations are not required to pay a tax on that part of their income allocable to business carried on or property located without the state.\n We think that the selection of such income for taxation at rates and with deductions not shown to be unrelated to an equitable distribution of the tax burden is not a denial of the equal protection commanded by the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. Amend. 14. It cannot be doubted that the receipt of dividends from a corporation is an event which may constitutionally be taxed either with or without deductions, Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 \nU.S. 339\n, 38 S.Ct. 543; see Helvering v. Inde- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 144]\n\u00a0\n pendent Life Ins. Co., \n292 \nU.S. 371, 381\n, 54 S.Ct. 758, 760, even though the corporate income which is their source has also been taxed. See Tennessee v. Whitworth, \n117 \nU.S. 129, 136\n, 6 S.Ct. 645, 647; Klein v. Board of Tax Supervisors, \n282 \nU.S. 19, 23\n, 51 S.Ct. 15, 73 A.L.R. 679; Colgate v. Harvey, \n296 \nU.S. 404, 420\n, 56 S.Ct. 252, 254, 102 A.L.R. 54. The fact that the dividends of corporations which have to some extent borne the burden of state taxation constitute a distinct class for purposes of tax exemption, Colgate v. Harvey, supra; compare Travelers' Insurance Company v. Connecticut, \n185 \nU.S. 364, 367\n, 22 S.Ct. 673, 674; Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 \nU.S. 730\n, 23 S.Ct. 401; Darnell v. Indiana, \n226 \nU.S. 390, 398\n, 33 S.Ct. 120, and that in consequence such dividends have borne no tax burden, is equally a basis for their selection for taxation. Watson v. State Comptroller, \n254 \nU.S. 122, 124\n, 125 S., 41 S.Ct. 43, 44; Klein v. Board of Tax Supervisors, supra. Any classification of taxation is permissible which has reasonable relation to a legitimate end of governmental action. Taxation is but the means by which government distributes the burdens of its cost among those who enjoy its benefits. And the distribution of a tax burden by placing it in part on a special class which by reason of the taxing policy of the State has escaped all tax during the taxable period is not a denial of equal protection. See Watson v. Comptroller, supra, page 125, 41 S.Ct. page 44. Nor is the tax any more a denial of equal protection because retroactive. If the 1933 dividends differed sufficiently from other classes of income to admit of the taxation, in that year, of one without the other, lapse of time did not remove that difference so as to compel equality of treatment when the income was taxed at a later date. Selection then of the dividends for the new taxation can hardly be thought to be hostile or invidious when the basis of selection is the fact that the taxed income is of the class which has borne no tax burden. The equal protection clause does not preclude the legislature from changing its mind in making an otherwise permissible choice of subjects of taxation. The very fact that \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 145]\n\u00a0\n the dividends were relieved of tax, when the need for revenue was less, is basis for the legislative judgment that they should bear some of the added burden when the need is greater.\n Numerous retroactive revisions of the federal and Wisconsin revenue laws, presently to be discussed, have imposed taxes on subjects previously untaxed and shifted the burden of old taxes by changes in rates, exemptions and deductions. It has never been thought that such changes involve a denial of equal protection if the new taxes could have been included in the earlier act when adopted. If some retroactive alteration in the scheme of a tax act is permissible, as is conceded, it seems plain that validity, so far as equal protection is concerned must be determined, as in the case of any other tax, by ascertaining whether the thing taxed falls within a distinct class which may rationally be treated differently from other classes. If such changes are forbidden in the name of equal protection, legislatures in laying new taxes would be left powerless to rectify to any extent a previous distribution of tax burdens which experience had shown to be inequitable, even though constitutional.\n The bare fact that the present tax is imposed at different rates and with different deductions from those applied to other types of income does not establish unconstitutionality. It is a commonplace that the equal protection clause does not require a state to maintain rigid rules of equal taxation, to resort to close distinctions, or to maintain a precise scientific uniformity. Possible differences in tax burdens, not shown to be substantial, or which are based on discrimination not shown to be arbitrary or capricious, do not fall within the constitutional prohibition. Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276, 284\n, 285 S., 52 S.Ct. 556, 558, 559, 87 A.L.R. 374, and cases cited.\n Just what the differences are in the tax burdens cast upon the two types of income by the divergence in rates \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 146]\n\u00a0\n and deductions applied to them does not appear. The burden placed on dividends by the taxing act might have been greater if they had been included in gross income and taxed on the same basis as other income since, in that case, the resulting increase in net income would be taxed at the rates applicable to the higher brackets. When the challenged statute was enacted there were available to the legislature the returns for the taxable year showing the different classes of income, the application to them of the existing law, and the effect of existing rates and deductions. There were also data to be derived from the corporation tax returns showing what part of the exempted dividends had their source in corporate income which had been taxed to the corporation and what part was attributable to corporate income not similarly taxed. The legislature was free to take into account all these factors in prescribing rates and deductions to be applied to the newly taxed dividends so as to arrive at an equitable distribution of the added tax burden. In the absence of any facts tending to show that the taxing act, in its purpose or effect, is a hostile or oppressive discrimination against the recipients of dividends who have been hitherto fortunate enough to escape all taxation we cannot say the taxing statute denies equal protection.\n Second. The objection chiefly urged to the taxing statute is that it is a denial of due process of law because in 1935 it imposed a tax on income received in 1933. But a tax is not necessarily unconstitutional because retroactive. Milliken v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 15, 21\n, 51 S.Ct. 324, 326, and cases cited. Taxation is neither a penalty imposed on the taxpayer nor a liability which he assumes by contract. It is but a way of apportioning the cost of government among those who in some measure are privileged to enjoy its benefits and must bear its burdens. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 147]\n\u00a0\n Since no citizen enjoys immunity from that burden, its retroactive imposition does not necessarily infringe due process, and to challenge the present tax it is not enough to point out that the taxable event, the receipt of income, antedated the statute.\n In the cases in which this Court has held invalid the taxation of gifts made and completely vested before the enactment of the taxing statute, decision was rested on the ground that the nature or amount of the tax could not reasonably have been anticipated by the taxpayer at the time of the particular voluntary act which the statute later made the taxable event. Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531, 542\n, 47 S.Ct. 710, 713, 52 A.L.R. 1081; Untermyer v. Anderson, \n276 \nU.S. 440, 445\n, 48 S.Ct. 353, 354 (citing Blodgett v. Holden, \n275 \nU.S. 142, 147\n, 48 S.Ct. 105, 106); Coolidge v. Long, \n282 \nU.S. 582\n, 51 S.Ct. 306. Since, in each of these cases, the donor might freely have chosen to give or not to give, the taxation, after the choice was made, of a gift which he might well have refrained from making had he anticipated the tax, was thought to be so arbitrary and oppressive as to be a denial of due process. But there are other forms of taxation whose retroactive imposition cannot be said to be similarly offensive, because their incidence is not on the voluntary act of the taxpayer. And even a retroactive gift tax has been held valid where the donor was forewarned by the statute books of the possibility of such a levy, Milliken v. United States, supra. In each case it is necessary to consider the nature of the tax and the circumstances in which it is laid before it can be said that its retroactive application is so harsh and oppressive as to transgress the constitutional limitation.\n Property taxes and benefit assessments of real estate, retroactively applied, are not open to the objection successfully urged in the gift cases. See Phillip Wagner, Inc., v. Leser, Judge of the Appeal Tax Court of Baltimore, \n239 \nU.S. 207\n, 36 S.Ct. 66; City of Seattle v. Kelleher, \n195 \nU.S. 351\n, 25 S.Ct. 44; \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 148]\n\u00a0\n compare Citizens' National Bank v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 443, 454\n, 30 S.Ct. 532, 535; Billings v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 261, 282\n, 34 S. Ct. 421, 424. Similarly, a tax on the receipt of income is not comparable to a gift tax. We can not assume that stockholders would refuse to receive corporate dividends even if they knew that their receipt would later be subjected to a new tax or to the increase of an old one. The objection to the present tax is of a different character and is addressed only to the particular inconvenience of the taxpayer in being called upon, after the customary time for levy and payment of the tax has passed, to bear a governmental burden of which it is said he had no warning and which he did not anticipate.\n Assuming that a tax may attempt to reach events so far in the past as to render that objection valid, we think that no such case is presented here. For more than seventy-five years it has been the familiar legislative practice of Congress in the enactment of revenue laws to tax retroactively income or profits received during the year of the session in which the taxing statute is enacted, and in some instances during the year of the preceding session. See Untermyer v. Anderson, supra, Footnote 1. These statutes not only increased the tax burden by laying new taxes and increasing the rates of old ones or both, but they redistributed retroactively the tax burdens imposed by preexisting laws. This was notably the case with the 'Revenue Act of 1918,' enacted February 24, 1919, 40 Stat. 1057, and made applicable to the calendar year 1918, which cut down exemptions and deductions, increased, in varying degrees, income, excess profits and capital stock taxes, altered the basis of surtaxes, and increased in progressive ratio the rates applicable to the higher brackets. Similarly the special munition manufacturer's tax, imposed on profits derived from sales of munitions, Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 780, was applied to the twelve months ending December 31, \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 149]\n\u00a0\n 1916. Cf. Carbon Steel Co. v. Lewellyn, \n251 \nU.S. 501\n, 40 S.Ct. 283; United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422, 435\n, 46 S.Ct. 131, 132. The contention that the retroactive application of the Revenue Acts is a denial of the due process guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment, U.S.C.A. Const. Amend. 5, has been uniformly rejected. Stockdale v. Insurance Companies, 20 Wall. 323, 331; Lake Shore & M. S. Railroad Co. v. Rose, \n95 \nU.S. 78\n, 80; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107\n, 31 S.Ct. 342, Ann.Cas.1912B, 1312; Billings v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 261, 282\n, 34 S.Ct. 421, 424; Brushaber v.

United States, \n256 \nU.S. 377\n, 41 S.Ct. 528. The like practice of the legislature of Wisconsin has been approved by its courts. 4\n The equitable distribution of the costs of government through the medium of an income tax is a delicate and difficult task. In its performance experience has shown the importance of reasonable opportunity for the legislative body, in the revision of tax laws, to distribute increased costs of government among its taxpayers in the light of present need for revenue and with knowledge of the sources and amounts of the various classes of taxable income during the taxable period preceding revision. Without that opportunity accommodation of the legislative purpose to the need may be seriously obstructed if not defeated. We cannot say that the due process which the Constitution exacts denies that opportunity to legislatures; that it withholds from them, more than in the case of a prospective tax, authority to distribute the increased tax burden in the light of experience and in conformity with accepted notions of the requirements of equal protection; or that in view of well established \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 150]\n\u00a0\n legislative practice, both state and national, taxpayers can justly assert surprise or complain of arbitrary action in the retroactive apportionment of tax burdens to income at the first opportunity after knowledge of the nature and amount of the income is available. And we think that the 'recent transactions' to which this Court has declared a tax law may be retroactively applied, Cooper v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 409, 411\n, 50 S.Ct. 164, must be taken to include the receipt of income during the year of the legislative session preceding that of its enactment.\n The Joint Resolution of Congress of July 4, 1864, No. 77, 13 Stat. 417, imposed an additional tax on incomes earned during the calendar year 1863, this tax being imposed after the taxes for the year had been paid. In Stockdale v. Insurance Companies, supra, page 331, Mr. Justice Miller said of it: 'The right of Congress to have imposed this tax by a new statute, although the measure of it was governed by the income of the past year, cannot be doubted, ... no one doubted the validity of the tax or attempted to resist it.' The Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, Tit. 2, 40 Stat. 1057, 1058-1088, which taxed incomes for the calendar year 1918, was applied without question as to its constitutionality in United States v. Robbins, \n269 \nU.S. 315\n, 46 S.Ct. 148, and in other cases.\n In the present case the returns of income received in 1933 were filed and became available in March, 1934. Wisconsin Stat. 1933,  71.09(4). The next succeeding session of the legislature at which tax legislation could be considered was in 1935, when the challenged statute was passed. By  11, Art. 4,  4, Art. 5, of the Wisconsin constitution, and  13.02 Wisconsin Statutes, 1935, regular sessions of the legislature are held in each odd- numbered year. Special sessions of the legislature may be held on call of the governor, at which no business can be transacted 'except as shall be necessary to accomplish \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 151]\n\u00a0\n the special purposes for which it was convened.' A special session was called by the governor in 1934, but for purposes unrelated to taxation. Proclamations of the Governor of Wisconsin December 2, 28, 1933, January 18, 22, 30, 1934. Thus the legislature in 1935, at the first opportunity after the tax year in which the income was received, made its revision of the tax laws applicable to 1933 income, as did Congress in the Joint Resolution of July 4, 1864, commented on in Stockdale v. Insurance Companies, supra.\n While the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, 223 Wis. 319, 271 N.W. 68, 72 thought that the present tax might 'approach or reach the limit of permissible retroactivity', we cannot say that it exceeds it.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS (dissenting).\n The Constitution of Wisconsin, Article 8, Sec. 1, provides: 'Taxes may also be imposed on incomes, privileges and occupations, which taxes may be graduated and progressive, and reasonable exemptions may be provided.' Pursuant to this grant, the State, since 1911,1 has had a statute levying a general income tax on corporations and individuals at a graduated rate. The system, which is analogous to that with which we are familiar in the federal field, has, like the latter, been amended from time to time in detail. The law as it stood in 1933 is found in the 1933 edition of the Wisconsin statutes as chapter 71. The tax is imposed for annual periods. The gross income of a given year includes rents, dividends, wages, and salaries, profits from the transaction of business or sale of property and all other gains, profits, or income derived from any source except such as are specifically exempted. In ascertaining taxable income each tax payer \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 152]\n\u00a0\n is entitled to deduct from gross receipts wages, salaries, and other expenses of conducting a business, occupation, or profession, depreciation, also cost of property sold. In addition each is permitted to deduct certain losses incurred within the year not compensated by insurance, interest paid on indebtedness, state and federal taxes, contributions to the State or its subdivisions or to charitable objects and amounts paid to an unemployment reserve. \n2\n Pensions are exempted, and a specified amount may be deducted from the tax, when ascertained, as a personal exemption. \n3\n Dividends (with exceptions not material) received from certain corporations filing income tax returns under the law, and paying income tax to the State, are deductible from gross income. \n4\n We were told at the bar that this deduction had been authorized for many years prior to 1933.\n The appellant, a resident of Wisconsin, on or about March 15, 1934, as by law required, made a return of his income for 1933 showing his gross income and took deductions for interest paid, for losses on the sale of securities, for business expenses, for charitable contributions, and for dividends received from certain corporations, with the result that no net taxable income remained. Without the deduction of the dividends his net income would have been $2,221.39.\n When the Wisconsin legislature met in its regular biennial session in January 1935 it was confronted by a need for additional revenue to meet the State's obligations. The condition is referred to as an emergency because the need for additional funds grew out of the then current relief load, but the emergency was no different than if the State had found itself short of funds for the \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 153]\n\u00a0\n payment of official salaries. As the Supreme Court of Wisconsin has said: 'Expense for relief of the unemployed is on no different footing than any other governmental expense.' \n5\n And it goes without saying that an emergency does not create power but is merely the occasion for the exercise of existing powers in conformity to constitutional principles. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n What then did the legislature do to meet the demand for public revenue? It adopted a statute effective March 27, 1935.7 By section 2 this act laid an income tax additional to and separate from the general income tax at a graduated rate on the income of all individuals, for the year 1934, which was to be 'assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner, upon the same income and subject to the same regulations,' as provided 'by law for the assessment, collection and payment of the normal income tax' with certain variations. One of the variations was that no deduction was to be allowed for those corporate dividends which were deductible under subsection (4) of section 71.04 of the general law.\n Section 3 imposed an additional tax on transfers of property made up to July 1, 1937. Section 4 placed additional license fees for the year 1934 on telephone companies. Section 5 imposed an additional license fee for 1934 upon electric, gas and similar utility companies.\n Section 6 imposed on the 1933 dividends, which had been deductible under the general law, a graduated tax of one per cent. on the first two thousand dollars of net dividend income, three per cent. on the next $3, 000, and seven per cent. on all above $5,000. Net dividend income is defined as gross dividend income less $750. The tax \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 154]\n\u00a0\n is to be assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as the normal income tax for 1934. Under this section the appellant was required to make return and pay on some $12,000 of the dividends which he had been permitted to deduct from gross income in calculating and paying his income tax for 1933 and was assessed thereon $545.71 which he paid under protest and brought this section to recover.\n The question is whether Section 6 transgresses the prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const. Amend. 14. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin, although stating that 'While the present tax may approach or reach the limit of permissible retroactivity, it does not exceed it', 223 Wis. 319, 271 N.W. 68, 72, sustained the statute as against challenge under the equal protection and due process clauses of the amendment. \n8\n I think the statute is violative of the guarantees of equal protection and due process.\n One must ignore the realities of the situation if he approaches a decision of the case in the light of the equal protection clause as if the statute under attack were prospective in operation; or, in the light of the due process clause, as if the statute were a revision of an existing general income tax system theretofore in force. The illegal discrimination and the arbitrary character of the Act condemn it under the equal protection clause not because it selects a particular class of citizens for the imposition of the tax but because, in so doing, it reaches back and singles out for a new and wholly different sort of income tax those few only to whom a specific deduction was allowed in the general computation of their taxable income for the year 1933. It will not do to examine the classifi- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 155]\n\u00a0\n cation as if it were the declaration of a new policy of taxation to be operative in the future. No more will it do to separate the retroactive feature of the law and consider it as if it were a mere amendment of a general income tax system as such applicable to all income of all taxpayers subject to the law as it stood at the date of the amendment. The reason for allowing the deduction is plain. As has been said in this court: 'The purpose of the Legislature was solely to prevent double taxation by the state of Wisconsin, of the income received by individuals in the form of dividends.' \n9\n The same thing may be said as to the reason for other allowable deductions, as, for instance, of taxes paid. Reasons of fairness and public policy moved the State to allow the permitted deductions from gross income.\n It readily may be conceded that Wisconsin is, and always has been, free in the imposition of an income tax, for good and sufficient reason, to treat the recipients of dividends on a basis different from the recipients of other sorts of income. The State also was free to revoke, alter, and amend the provisions for deductions as its views of fairness and policy might dictate. This case presents no such situation. After the taxpayers had returned and paid their tax under the existing system and according to the long established public policy of the State, the State sought additional revenues. Instead of levying an exaction upon the citizens generally or certain classes of citizens, the State went back and sought to tax a small class of income tax payers by reason of the purely arbitrary and adventitious fact that they had been allowed a particular deduction in a past year. It chose as the base of the tax a part of the income of the taxpayer under the law as previously in force. The previously granted deduction was not withdrawn but, on the contrary, the income rep- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 156]\n\u00a0\n resented by that deduction was picked out from all others, was classified by itself and taxed in a manner wholly unrelated to the income and the taxes of the recipient of these dividends under the general law under which he had computed and paid his tax. If the State was at liberty to do this it was equally free to tax at a new rate and upon a new scheme income of the taxpayers who in 1933 deducted losses sustained or those who deducted interest paid or taxes paid or charitable contributions made. It was equally at liberty to form a taxable class of those who were granted personal exemptions, to wrest out of their setting, as part of the general income of a taxpayer, rents received, royalties received, or professional income accrued in 1933 and to impose a special income tax on one or all of those items. As the trial judge well said:\n'In the equitable distribution of taxation persons receiving dividends in the year 1933 should not be classified less favorably than persons receiving other kinds of income that year. For the purpose of taxation the income was not materially different than the following kinds: Salaries paid officers of private corporations; salaries paid to public officials; interest; rents; profit and income of all kinds received by individuals and corporations generally, unless some good reason appeared for some legislative exception.\n\n'The statute is also discriminatory against the class of persons receiving dividends in the year 1933 when compared with other classes of persons when such other classes are assessed at all. It discriminates in being more drastic in limiting deductions for losses, expenses and exemptions. It is more drastic in the rapid increase of the graduated rate. For some reason one class only was selected to bear the entire burden of the emergency tax in question. This class was subjected to an unusually inequitable burden.'\n\n Decisions sustaining the power of a state prospectively to classify, to grant exemptions, or otherwise to inter \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 157]\n\u00a0\n relate the tax burdens of different classes of taxpayers are of no aid and lend no support to the present statute. In no case heretofore to which attention has been called have the courts sustained a law which after the fact reaches back two years and selects for a special form of income taxation at a new rate a group of the taxpayers who, in accordance with preexisting law, had paid that share of the general income tax which the legislature had adjudged to be its equal and proportionate share of the burden of government. To attempt this was, in my judgment, arbitrary and discriminatory classification.\n From what has been said I think it apparent that the retroactivity of the challenged statute taken alone is not the element which condemns it any more than the attempted classification alone would condemn it if the act were prospective in operation. The cases relied upon to support the statute, viewed in its retroactive aspect, do not meet the present case. In one of the cited cases,-United States v. Hudson, \n299 \nU.S. 498, 500\n, 57 S.Ct. 309, 310,-earlier decisions were thus summarized: 'As respects income tax statutes, it long has been the practice of Congress to make them retroactive for relatively short periods so as to include profits from transactions consummated while the statute was in process of enactment, or within so much of the calendar year as preceded the enactment; and repeated decisions of this Court have recognized this practice and sustained it ....' That was a case which fell squarely within this statement of the scope of permissible retroactivity. All enactments sustained that amended the tax system of a prior year were continuations of that existing system, and the taxpayers had knowledge before the expiration of the year of receipt of the income by which the tax was measured that amendment of the system was under consideration. To this class belongs the provision of the Wisconsin Act of 1935 imposing an additional tax on income received in 1934. This feature of the Act is \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 158]\n\u00a0\n not here under attack. A very different course was adopted with respect to the income of 1933. For that year the statute imposed a special income tax on a class selected because the law in force when they paid their taxes had permitted them to deduct certain items, and ignored all others to whom similar deductions had been granted. Thus the whole scheme of the general income tax was unbalanced and a peculiar and specific burden laid upon a selected few who had theretofore been relieved of the unjust burden of double taxation. What was said in Milliken v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 15, 21\n, 51 S.Ct. 324, 326, is peculiarly apposite to the facts here disclosed. There, referring to earlier decisions, condemning, under the due process clause, retroactive taxes, it was stated: 'In both the point was stressed, as the basis of decision, that the nature and amount of the tax burden imposed could not have been understood and foreseen by the taxpayer at the time of the particular voluntary act which was made the occasion of the tax.' Here the nature and amount of this special and peculiar tax could not have been understood and foreseen when the petitioner paid his 1933 income tax.\n It is to be remembered that the Act in question is not a curative statute for the collection of taxes assessed in a prior year and uncollected10 nor one intended to make available taxes which, by reason of illegality in their imposition, were not paid in the year in which they were assessed. \n11\n The Act is not a remedial measure to confirm or ratify a doubtful administrative interpretation of prior legislation. \n12\n It does not lay an excise or a privilege measured by the income of a prior year,13 nor is it a statute to settle doubts as to whether an earlier taxing act had expired by limitation. 14 \n\n[305 \nU.S. 134, 159]\n\u00a0\n It was suggested at the bar that the exaction is a property tax and bad as such because retroactively imposed. The reply was that retroactive property taxes have been upheld. The cases cited do not touch the validity of an ad valorem property tax retroactively imposed. Some of them involved special assessments for benefits assessed after the completion of the improvement. 15 Another cited to the proposition dealt with an excise for the use, for pleasure, of foreign built yachts either owned or chartered by the user for more than six months during the taxable year. The exaction was held an excise on the privilege of use and not a tax upon ownership, and, moreover, the tax was not retroactive in operation but was assessed upon the taxpayer at a date during which the taxpayer's use of the yacht continued. \n16\n Still another dealt with a curative act passed to reach property illegally assessed. \n17\n But whether viewed as a property or an income tax the exaction is bad. Most, if not all, the states have long maintained the policy of exempting places of religious worship from annual tax levies. Will it be contended that if the state were not to impose a tax on the value of such exempt property for some past year, the action would not be an arbitrary taking of property as well as a hostile discrimination?\n If, as this court has repeatedly said, an income tax is an equitable method of distributing the necessary burdens of government, certainly no such discrimination as is evidenced by the challenged act can properly fall within the description. The Act evidences purposeful and arbitrary discrimination and thus violates the guarantee of equal protection.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 71.04(4) permits the deduction from gross income of dividends received from corporations whose principal business is attributable to Wisconsin; '... any corporation shall be considered as having its principal business attributable to Wisconsin if 50 per cent. or more of the entire net income or loss of such corporation ... (for the year preceding the payment of such dividends) was used in computing the average taxable income provided by chapter 71 ....' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] C. 539,  4, Laws of Wisconsin of 1927. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] See note 1, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Income Tax Cases, 1912, 148 Wis. 456, 514, 134 N.W. 673, 135 N.W. 164; State ex rel.

The question for decision is whether the tax laid under this statute on appellants, who sell without the state, to advertisers there, space in a journal which they publish in New Mexico and circulate to subscribers within and without the state, imposes an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.\n Appellants brought the present suit in the state district court to recover the tax, which they had paid under protest, as exacted in violation of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. Article 1,  8, cl. 3. The trial court overruled a demurrer to the complaint and gave judgment for appellants, which the Supreme Court reversed. 41 N.M. 141, 65 P.2d 863. Appellants refusing to plead further, the district court gave judgment for the appellees, which the Supreme Court affirmed. 41 N.M. 288, 67 P.2d 505. The case comes here on appeal from the second judgment under section 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U.S.C.A.  344.\n Appellants publish a monthly livestock trade journal which they wholly prepare, edit, and publish within the state of New Mexico, where their only office and place of business is located. The journal has a circulation in New Mexico and other states, being distributed to paid subscribers through the mails or by other means of transportation. It carries advertisements, some of which are \n\n[303 \nU.S. 250, 253]\n\u00a0\n obtained from advertisers in other states through appellants' solicitation there. Where such contracts are entered into, payment is made by remittances to appellants sent interstate; and the contracts contemplate and provide for the interstate shipment by the advertisers to appellants of advertising cuts, mats, information, and copy. Payment is due after the printing of such advertisements in the journal and its ultimate circulation and distribution, which is alleged to be in New Mexico and other states.\n Appellants insist here, as they did in the state courts, that the sums earned under the advertising contracts are immune from the tax because the contracts are entered into by transactions across state lines and result in the like transmission of advertising materials by advertisers to appellants, and also because performance involves the mailing or other distribution of appellants' magazines to points without the state.\n That the mere formation of a contract between persons in different states is not within the protection of the commerce clause, at least in the absence of Congressional action, unless the performance is within its protection, is a proposition no longer open to question.

Hence it is unnecessary to consider the impact of the tax upon the advertising contracts except as it affects their performance, presently to be discussed. Nor is taxation of a local business or occupation which is separate and distinct from the transportation and intercourse which is interstate commerce forbidden merely because in the ordinary course such transportation or intercourse is induced or occasioned by the business.

Here the tax which is laid on the compensation received under the contract is not forbidden either because the contract, apart from its performance, is within the protection of the commerce clause, or because as an incident preliminary to printing and publishing the advertisements the advertisers send cuts, copy and the like to appellants.\n We turn to the other and more vexed question, whether the tax is invalid because the performance of the contract, for which the compensation is paid, involves to some extent the distribution, interstate, of some copies of the magazine containing the advertisements. We lay to one side the fact that appellants do not allege specifically that the contract stipulates that the advertisements shall be sent to subscribers out of the state, or is so framed that the compensation would not be earned if subscribers outside the state should cancel their subscriptions. We assume the point in appellants' favor and address ourselves to their argument that the present tax infringes the commerce clause because it is measured by gross receipts which are to some extent augmented by appellants' maintenance of an interstate circulation of their magazine.\n It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business. 'Even interstate business must pay its way,' Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Richmond, \n249 \nU.S. 252, 259\n, 39 S.Ct. 265, 266; Ficklen v. Shelby County Taxing District, \n145 \nU.S. 1, 24\n, 12 S.Ct. 810; Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 \nU.S. 688, 696\n, 15 S.Ct. 268, 360; Galveston, H. & S.A.R. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 225\n, 227 S., 28 S. Ct. 638, and the bare fact that one is carrying on interstate commerce does not relieve him from many forms of state taxation which add to the cost of his business. He is subject to a property tax on \n\n[303 \nU.S. 250, 255]\n\u00a0\n the instruments employed in the commerce, Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Massachusetts, \n125 \nU.S. 530\n, 8 S.Ct. 961; Cleveland, C., C. & St. L.R. Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 439\n, 14 S.Ct. 1122; Adams Express Co. v.

Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18\n, 11 S.Ct. 876; Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450\n, 38 S.Ct. 373. Net earnings from interstate commerce are subject to income tax, United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321\n, 38 S.Ct. 499, Ann.Cas.1918E, 748, and, if the commerce is carried on by a corporation, a franchise tax may be imposed, measured by the net income from business done within the state, including such portion of the income derived from interstate commerce as may be justly attributable to business done within the state by a fair method of apportionment, Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113\n, 41 S.Ct. 45. Cf. Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton, Ltd. v. State Tax Commission, \n266 \nU.S. 271\n, 45 S.Ct. 82.\n All of these taxes in one way or another add to the expense of carrying on interstate commerce, and in that sense burden it; but they are not for that reason prohibited. On the other hand, local taxes, measured by gross receipts from interstate commerce, have often been pronounced unconstitutional. The vice characteristic of those which have been held invalid is that they have placed on the commerce burdens of such a nature as to be capable in point of substance, of being imposed, Fargo v. Stevens, Michigan, \n121 \nU.S. 230\n, 7 S.Ct. 857; Philadelphia & S.M.S.S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326\n, 7 S.Ct. 1118; Galveston, H. & S.A.R. Co. v. Texas, supra; Meyer v.

See Philadelphia & S.M.S.S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, \n122 \nU.S. 326, 346\n, 7 S. Ct. 1118; State Freight Tax, 15 Wall. 232, 280; Bradley, J., dissenting in Maine v.

The multiplication of state taxes measured by the gross receipts from interstate transactions would spell the destruction of interstate commerce and renew the barriers to interstate trade which it was the object of the commerce clause to remove. Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, \n294 \nU.S. 511, 523\n, 55 S.Ct. 497, 500, 101 A.L.R. 55.\n It is for these reasons that a state may not lay a tax measured by the amount of merchandise carried in interstate commerce, State Freight Tax, supra, or upon the freight earned by its carriage, Fargo v. Stevens, supra; Philadelphia & S.M.S.S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, restricting the effect of State Tax on Railway Gross Receipts, 15 Wall. 284, with which compare Miller, J., dissenting in that case at page 297. Taxation measured by gross receipts from interstate commerce has been sustained when fairly apportioned to the commerce carried on within the taxing state, Wisconsin & M.R. Co. v. Powers, \n191 \nU.S. 379\n, 24 S.Ct. 107; Maine v. Grand Trunk Railway, supra; Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, supra; United States Express Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 \nU.S. 335\n, 32 S.Ct. 211, and in other cases has been rejected only because the apportionment was found to be inadequate or unfair, Fargo v. Michigan, supra; Galveston, H. & S.A.R. Co. v. Texas, supra; Meyer v. Wells, Fargo & Co., supra, with which compare Wisconsin & M.R. Co. v. Powers, supra. Whether the tax was sustained as a fair means of measuring a local privilege or franchise, as in Maine v. Grand Trunk Railway, supra; Ficklen v. Shelby County Taxing \n\n[303 \nU.S. 250, 257]\n\u00a0\n District, supra; American Manufacturing Company v. St. Louis, \n250 \nU.S. 459\n, 39 S.Ct. 522, or as a method of arriving at the fair measure of a tax substituted for local property taxes, Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, supra; United States Express Company v. Minnesota, supra; cf. Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, supra; see McHenry v. Alford, \n168 \nU.S. 651, 670\n, 671 S., 18 S.Ct. 242, it is a practical way of laying upon the commerce its share of the local tax burden without subjecting it to multiple taxation not borne by local commerce and to which it would be subject if gross receipts, unapportioned, could be made the measure of a tax laid in every state where the commerce is carried on. A tax on gross receipts from tolls for the use by interstate trains of tracks lying wholly within the taxing state is valid, New York, L.E. & W.R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n158 \nU.S. 431\n, 15 S.Ct. 896; cf. Henderson Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, \n166 \nU.S. 150\n, 17 S.Ct. 532, although a like tax on gross receipts from the rental of railroad cars used in interstate commerce both within and without the taxing state is invalid. Fargo v. Michigan, supra. In the one case the tax reaches only that part of the commerce carried on within the taxing state; in the other it extends to the commerce carried on without the state boundaries, and, if valid, could be similarly laid in every other state in which the business is conducted.\n In the present case the tax is, in form and substance, an excise conditioned on the carrying on of a local business, that of providing and selling advertising space in a published journal, which is sold to and paid for by subscribers, some of whom receive it in interstate commerce. The price at which the advertising is sold is made the measure of the tax. This Court has sustained a similar tax said to be on the privilege of manufacturing, measured by the total gross receipts from sales of the manufactured goods both intrastate trastate and interstate. American Manufacturing Co. v. St. Louis, supra, \n250 \nU.S. 459, 462\n, 39 S.Ct. 522. The actual sales prices which \n\n[303 \nU.S. 250, 258]\n\u00a0\n measured the tax were taken to be no more than the measure of the value of the goods manufactured, and so an appropriate measure of the value of the privilege, the taxation of which was deferred until the goods were sold. Ficklen v. Shelby County Taxing District, supra, sustained a license tax measured by a percentage of the gross annual commissions received by brokers engaged in negotiating sales within for sellers without the state.\n Viewed only as authority, American Manufacturing Co. v. St. Louis, supra, would seem decisive of the present case. But we think the tax assailed here finds support in reason, and in the practical needs of a taxing system which, under constitutional limitations, must accommodate itself to the double demand that interstate business shall pay its way, and that at the same time it shall not be burdened with cumulative exactions which are not similarly laid on local business.\n As we have said, the carrying on of a local business may be made the condition of state taxation, if it is distinct from interstate commerce, and the business of preparing, printing and publishing magazine advertising is peculiarly local and distinct from its circulation whether or not that circulation be interstate commerce. Cf. Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. Tax Comm'n, \n302 \nU.S. 90\n, 58 S.Ct. 72. No one would doubt that the tax on the privilege would be valid if it were measured by the amount of advertising space sold. Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, supra; Federal Compress & W. Co. v. McLean, \n291 \nU.S. 17\n, 54 S.Ct. 267, or by its value. Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord, \n262 \nU.S. 172\n, 43 S.Ct. 526; Hope Natural Gas Co. v. Hall, \n274 \nU.S. 284\n, 47 S.Ct. 639. Selling price, taken as a measure of value whose accuracy appellants do not challenge, is for all practical purposes a convenient means of arriving at an equitable measure of the burden which may be imposed on an admittedly taxable subject matter. Unlike the measure of the tax sustained in American Manufacturing Co. v. St. Louis, supra, it does not embrace \n\n[303 \nU.S. 250, 259]\n\u00a0\n the purchase price (here the magazine subscription price) of the articles shipped in interstate commerce. So far as the advertising rates reflect a value attributable to the maintenance of a circulation of the magazine interstate, we think the burden on the interstate business is too remote and too attenuated to call for a rigidly logical application of the doctrine that gross receipts from interstate commerce may not be made the measure of a tax. Experience has taught that the opposing demands that the commerce shall bear its share of local taxation, and that it shall not, on the other hand, be subjected to multiple tax burdens merely because it is interstate commerce, are not capable of reconciliation by resort to the syllogism. Practical rather than logical distinctions must be sought. See Galveston, H. & S.A.R. Co. v. Texas, supra, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 227\n, 28 S.Ct. 638. Recognizing that not every local law that affects commerce is a regulation of it in a constitutional sense, this Court has held that local taxes may be laid on property used in the commerce; that its value for taxation may include the augmentation attributable to the commerce in which it is employed; and, finally, that the equivalent of that value may be computed by a measure related to gross receipts when a tax of the latter is substituted for a tax of the former. See Galveston, H . & S.A.R. Co. v. Texas, supra, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 225\n, 28 S.Ct. 638\n\n\n Here it is perhaps enough that the privilege taxed is of a type which has been regarded as so separate and distinct from interstate transportation as to admit of different treatment for purposes of taxation, Utah Light & Power Co. v. Pfost, supra; Federal Compress & Warehouse Co. v. McLean, supra; Chassaniol v. Greenwood, \n291 \nU.S. 584\n, 54 S.Ct. 541, and that the value of the privilege is fairly measured by the receipts. The tax is not invalid because the value is enhanced by appellants' circulation of their journal interstate any more than property taxes on railroads are invalid because property value is increased by the circumstance that the railroads do an interstate business. \n\n[303 \nU.S. 250, 260]\n\u00a0\n But there is an added reason why we think the tax is not subject to the objection which has been leveled at taxes laid upon gross receipts derived from interstate communication or transportation of goods. So far as the value contributed to appellants' New Mexico business by circulation of the magazine interstate is taxed, it cannot again be taxed elsewhere any more than the value of railroad property taxed locally. The tax is not one which in form or substance can be repeated by other states in such manner as to lay an added burden on the interstate distribution of the magazine. As already noted, receipts from subscriptions are not included in the measure of the tax. It is not measured by the extent of the circulation of the magazine interstate. All the events upon which the tax is conditioned-the preparation, printing and publication of the advertising matter, and the receipt of the sums paid for it-occur in New Mexico and not elsewhere. All are beyond any control and taxing power which, without the commerce clause, those states could exert through its dominion over the distribution of the magazine or its subscribers. The dangers which may ensue from the imposition of a tax measured by gross receipts derived directly from interstate commerce are absent.\n In this and other ways the case differs from Fisher's Blend Station, Inc., v. State Tax Comm'n, supra, on which appellants rely. There the exaction was a privilege tax laid upon the occupation of broadcasting, which the Court held was itself interstate communication, comparable to that carried on by the telegraph and the telephone, and was measured by the gross receipts derived from that commerce. If broadcasting could be taxed, so also could reception. Station WBT, Inc., v. Poulnot, D.C., 46 F. 2d 671.2 \n\n[303 \nU.S. 250, 261]\n\u00a0\n In that event a cumulative tax burden would be imposed on interstate communication such as might ensue if gross receipts from interstate transportation could be taxed. This was the vice of the tax of a percentage of the gross receipts from goods sold by a wholesaler in interstate commerce, held invalid in Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra. In form and in substance the tax was thought not to be one for the privilege of doing a local business separable from interstate commerce. Cf. American Manufacturing Co. v. St. Louis, supra. In none of these respects is the present tax objectionable.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of opinion that the judgment should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 201.

UNITED STATES(1938)\nNo. 96\nArgued: Decided: December 5, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[305 \nU.S. 281, 282]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John P. Ohl, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Edward J. Ennis, of New York City, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question decisive of this case is whether, under  23 and 101 of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 799, 811, 26 U.S.C.A.  23, 101, upon a liquidation of a corporation, stockholders' losses from their investment in its stock held for more than two years are ordinary losses deductible in full from gross income, or capital losses, 12 1\/2% of which is deductible under  101 from the tax as computed without regard to such losses.\n The decedent in each of these cases made an investment represented by shares of stock in a corporation. Upon complete liquidation of the corporation, more than two years later, the total liquidating dividends on the stock amounted to less than the cost of the investment. In their income tax returns for 1929 petitioners deducted from gross income the losses of their respective decedents. The commissioner ruled that the losses were capital net \n\n[305 \nU.S. 281, 283]\n\u00a0\n losses of which only 12 1\/2% was deductible, as provided by  101, and he accordingly found deficiencies, which petitioners paid.\n In the present suits, brought by petitioners in the Court of Claims to recover the payments of the deficiencies as overpayments of 1929 tax, recovery was denied. 21 F.Supp. 361. We granted certiorari, \n305 \nU.S. 581\n, 59 S.Ct. 69, 83 L.Ed. --, to resolve a conflict between the decision below and that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Chester N. Weaver Co. v. Commissioner, 97 F.2d 31, certiorari granted, \n305 \nU.S. 585\n, 59 S.Ct. 95, 83 L.Ed. --, which arose under related sections of the 1932 Revenue Act.\n Section 23(e) of the 1928 Act, 26 U.S.C.A.  23, declares that 'In computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions ... losses sustained during the taxable year ... (2) if incurred in any transaction entered into for profit, though not connected with the trade or business ; ....' And subsection (g), 45 Stat. 800, provides: 'The basis for determining the amount of deduction for losses sustained ... shall be the same as is provided in section 113 for determining the gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property.'\n These provisions of  23 are qualified and restricted by  101, which prescribes rates of tax applicable to capital net gains and the extent to which capital net losses are deductible in arriving at net taxable income. Section 101(c)(1) and (2) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A.  101, defines 'capital gain' as a 'gain from the sale or exchange of capital assets' and 'capital loss' as a 'deductible loss resulting from the sale or exchange of capital assets.' Section 101(c)(3) and (4), 26 U.S.C.A.  101, declares: \"Capital deductions' means such deductions as are allowed by section 23 for the purpose of computing net income, and are properly allocable to or chargeable against capital assets sold or exchanged during the taxable year ...;' and \" ordinary \n\n[305 \nU.S. 281, 284]\n\u00a0\n deductions' means the deductions allowed by section 23 other than capital losses and capital deductions.' By  101(c)(5) and (6), 26 U.S.C.A.  101, a 'capital net gain' or 'loss', results from the sale of 'capital assets', which are defined by  101(c)(8), 26 U.S.C.A.  101, as 'property held by the taxpayer for more than two years', not including 'stock in trade ... or other property' held by the taxpayer 'primarily for sale in the course of his trade or business.'\n Sections 23 and 101 place capital gains and losses as thus defined on a different basis from other types of gains and losses for the purpose of computing the tax. By  101(a), 26 U.S.C.A.  101 a capital net gain as defined by  101(c)(5) may, at the option of the taxpayer, be assessed at the rate of 12 1\/2% in lieu of all other taxes, and by  101(b), 26 U.S.C. A.  101, a capital net loss, defined by  101(6) as 'the excess of the sum of the capital losses plus the capital deductions over the total amount of capital gain,' may be deducted, only to the extent of 12 1\/2%, from the tax as computed without regard to the capital net loss. These sections, read together with  12, 21 and 22, 26 U.S.C.A.  12, 21, 22, presently to be discussed, thus provide a complete scheme for ascertaining capital gains and losses from the sale or exchange of property and for bringing them into the computation of the tax on net income, a scheme distinct from that applicable to other types of gains and losses resulting in ordinary net income, including those from sales and exchanges of property not capital assets.\n The losses here sustained are concededly losses on investments of capital, entitled to recognition in the computation of taxable net income, but petitioners' contention is that as the losses did not result from a sale or exchange of the stock they are not capital losses within the meaning of  101, which limits the deduction of such losses, and that in consequence they fall into the category of ordinary losses, deductible in full under  23. The answer to this contention turns upon the meaning and ef- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 281, 285]\n\u00a0\n fect of  115(c), 26 U.S.C.A.  115, which relates to distributions by corporations and appears in Supplement B of the 1928 Act. The section provides in part: 'Amounts distributed in complete liquidation of a corporation shall be treated as in full payment in exchange for the stock, and amounts distributed in partial liquidation of a corporation shall be treated as in part or full payment in exchange for the stock. The gain or loss to the distributee resulting from such exchange shall be determined under section 111, but shall be recognized only to the extent provided in section 112. ...' Section 111, 26 U.S.C.A.  111, contains the provisions for computation of gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property and refers, as does  23(g), to  113 as affording the basis for determining gain or loss upon sales or exchanges of property. By  112(a), 26 U.S.C.A.  112(a), it is provided that 'Upon the sale or exchange of property the entire amount of the gain or loss determined under section 111, shall be recognized, except as hereinafter provided in this section.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioners concede that the command of  115(c) that amounts distributed in complete liquidation of a corporation 'shall be treated as in full payment in exchange for the stock' and that the 'gain or loss ... shall be determined under section 111,' requires the gain or loss upon liquidation to be determined as are gains or losses upon sale of the stock under  111, 113, 26 U.S.C.A.  111, 113. The same method is adopted by 101 for determining gains or losses from sales of capital assets. \n2\n But they insist that the qualifica- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 281, 286]\n\u00a0\n tion that gain or loss 'shall be recognized only to the extent provided in section 112' and the fact that the provisions of  101 apply only to cases of sales or exchanges exclude the stockholders' gain or loss upon liquidation, which is not a sale or exchange, from the operation of the provisions of  101 governing the computation of the tax.\n Sections 101 and 115(c) are found in the provisions supplemental to the general provisions of subtitle B of the 1928 Revenue Act, which is concerned with rates of tax and computation of net income. Section 101 appears in Supplement A, relating to rates of tax, and  115 in Supplement B, concerning computation of net income. Both supplements serve to modify or explain the general provisions. '... the Supplemental Provisions are those which apply only to extraordinary classes of taxpayer or which apply only to the extraordinary transactions of ordinary classes of taxpayers.' Report, Committee on Ways and Means, No. 2, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 12. From the arrangement and general plan of the Act it is evident that the effect of  101 and 115 upon each other is not to be ascertained alone by the comparison of the two sections or by noting the absence of any reference to either by the other, but by noting and comparing the effect of each upon the general provisions, to which reference must be made in the first instance for all computations of income tax. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 281, 287]\n\u00a0\n Sections 12, 21, 22 and 23, found in subtitle B, General Provisions, to which  101 and 115 are supplementary, govern computation of net income and of the tax. Subsection (c) of  12, 45 Stat. 797, which fixes the rates of surtax, refers specifically to  101 for the rate and computation of tax on capital net gains and losses. \n3\n Section 21, 26 U.S.C. A.  21, declares that net income means gross income computed under  22, less the deductions allowed by  23. As already noted,  23(e), (g), providing for deductions of losses on sales or exchanges of property, is restricted in its operation by the provisions of  101. Otherwise,  101 would have no application to deductible losses. These general provisions thus incorporate by reference those of  101 and give to them controlling effect in the computation of the tax in cases of capital gains or losses upon the sale or exchange of capital assets. In addition,  22(d) provides that 'Distributions by corporations shall be taxable to the shareholders as provided in section 115,' which in turn, as already noted, provides in paragraph (c) that liquidating dividends 'shall be treated as in full payment in exchange for the stock,' and that resulting gains or losses determined, as in the case of sales or exchanges of property, under  111, are to be 'recognized only to the extent provided in section 112,' which also deals with sales and exchanges.\n Section 115(c) and  111 and 112, to which it refers, standing alone give no clue to the part which a stockholder's loss on liquidation is to play, in computation of the tax, more than they give in the case of gains and losses \n\n[305 \nU.S. 281, 288]\n\u00a0\n upon sales or exchanges of property. In each case they tell how the gain or loss is to be 'determined' and declare that it shall be 'recognized.' But as  115 says that the gain or loss upon liquidation is to be 'recognized' only to the extent to which gains or losses upon sales or exchanges of property are recognized by  112, it follows that in one case, as in the other, we must turn to the general provisions of the Act to learn what recognition is to be given to the gains or losses under  12, 22 and 23, as supplemented by  101. Admittedly the recognition accorded by  112 to gains and losses on sales of capital assets is controlled by  101, and  115(c), with its reference to  112, is explicit that gains and losses upon liquidations are to receive the recognition accorded to gains and losses upon sales of property. Consequently the recognition required by  115(c) of gains and losses on liquidations must, we think, be taken to be the same as that accorded to gains and losses upon sales of property in the computation of the tax under the general provisions to which  115 and  112 are supplementary and to be subject to the same restrictions as are imposed upon recognition of gains and losses from sales by the provisions of the supplementary section 101. Stockholders' gains and losses upon liquidation of the corporation are thus taxed on the same basis as gains or losses upon sales and exchanges of property, with the rate of tax and deductions prescribed by  101.\n If this conclusion were doubtful, doubts would be put at rest by the judicial construction of  115(c) as it appeared in the 1918 Act and by the legislative history of  101 and 115. The substance of the first sentence of  115(c) of the 1928 Act appeared, but without the reference to  111 and 112, in  201(c) of the 1918 Act, 40 Stat. 1059, which provided that 'Amounts distributed in the liquidation of a corporation shall be treated as payments in \n\n[305 \nU.S. 281, 289]\n\u00a0\n exchange for stock or shares, ....'4 In Hellmich v. Hellman, \n276 \nU.S. 233\n, 48 S.Ct. 244, 56 A.L.R. 379, it was held that this clause required a stockholder's gains upon liquidation to be treated as gains from the sale of property and therefore subject to the normal tax, although they were distributions from corporate earnings, and, under  201(a), (b) and 216(a), 40 Stat. 1059, 1069, dividends paid from such earnings were free from normal tax. The provisions of  115(c) prescribing the treatment of liquidating dividends were thus, from the beginning, taken to refer to the computation of the tax as well as to the determination of the gain or loss.\n The addition to the section in the 1924 and later Acts of the direction that gain or loss should be determined under the section corresponding to  111 of the 1928 Act and recognized only to the extent provided in the section corresponding to  112 of that Act requires no different result. For reasons already given it supports the conclusion that  115(c), like its precursor,  201(c) of the 1918 Act, as construed in Hellmich v. Hellman, supra, placed shareholders' gains and losses from liquidations upon the same basis, for computation of the tax, as gains and losses upon the sale or exchange of property. The reports of the Congressional Committees discussing  201(c) of the 1924 Act make it plain that that section, the relevant portion of which is identical with  115(c) of the 1928 Act, was intended to require gains upon corporate liquidations to be brought into the computation of \n\n[305 \nU.S. 281, 290]\n\u00a0\n the tax in the same manner as corresponding gains from sales. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Article 625 of Treasury Regulations 74, interpreting  101 and 115(c) of the 1928 Act, states in part: 'Any gain to the shareholder (from a distribution in liquidation of a corporation) may, at his option, be taxed as a capital net gain in the manner and subject to the conditions prescribed in section 101 ....' This regulation is a clear recognition that  115 and 101, when read with the other sections of the Act, are interdependent and require stockholders' gains upon liquidation to be taxed as are the corresponding gains on sales of property. The regulation, in identical form, first appeared in Article 1545 of Regulations 65 and 69, applicable to  201(c) and 208 of the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926, corresponding to  115(c) and 101 of the 1928 Act, and was continued in Article 625 of Regulations 77 with re- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 281, 291]\n\u00a0\n lation to the corresponding sections, 115(c) and 101, of the 1932 Act.\n The repeated reenactment of  101 and 115(c), as they appear in the Revenue Acts of 1924, 1928, and 1932, is upon accepted principles a Congressional adoption of the regulation as correctly interpreting those sections and is Congressional recognition that  101 and 115(c) are to be read together in order to ascertain the method by which gains and losses upon liquidation are to be taxed. The method, in the case of stock held for more than two years, is that applied by  101 to capital gains and losses from the sale or exchange of property.\n The fact that neither the decision in Hellmich v. Hellman, supra, nor the regulation deals specifically with losses does not admit of the conclusion that the stockholders' losses on liquidation are to be brought into computation of the tax on a basis different from gains and losses upon sales. Section 115(c) makes no distinction between the recognition of gains and the recognition of losses, and if one is controlled by the provisions of  101 the other must be. No adequate basis has been suggested for such a distinction.\n We attach no significance to the circumstance that the provisions of  101 of the 1928 Act first appeared in the 1921 Act, while the controlling provisions of  115(c) were enacted in the 1918 Act and in their final form in the 1924 Act. We accept petitioner's contention that all the provisions of  101 are by its terms restricted to cases of sales or exchanges. But if, as we have said,  115(c) requires the tax in case of liquidations to be computed upon the same basis as in case of sales of the stock, alteration in the method of ascertaining the tax could be made more readily by adding  101 or amending it than by amending  115(c), so long as it is the purpose to treat gains and losses on liquidation no dif- \n\n[305 \nU.S. 281, 292]\n\u00a0\n ferently from gains and losses on sales. Helvering v. Chester N. Weaver Co ., \n305 \nU.S. 293\n, 59 S.Ct. 185, decided this day.\n Petitioner argues that the construction which we think correct leads to the harsh and absurd consequence that a small liquidating dividend is more disadvantageous to the taxpayer than no distribution at all in the case where the stock has become worthless. This is an argument, more properly addressed to Congress, that the statute should have gone further than it did by providing that the loss in the case of worthless securities should be treated as a loss upon their sale, as was later done by  23(g)( 2) of the 1938 Act, 26 U.S.C.A.  23(g)(2). But it is not persuasive that we should disregard the language and history of the pertinent sections, with consequences equally harsh and absurd, to adopt the construction for which petitioners contend. Cf. Helvering v. Twin Bell Oil Syndicate, \n293 \nU.S. 312, 321\n, 55 S.Ct. 174, 178.\n We are not impressed by the argument that, as the question here decided is doubtful, all doubts should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. It is the function and duty of courts to resolve doubts. We know of no reason why that function should be abdicated in a tax case more than in any other where the rights of suitors turn on the construction of a statute and it is our duty to decide what that construction fairly should be. Here doubts which may arise upon a cursory examination of  101 and 115 disappear when they are read, as they must be, with every other material part of the statute, Hellmich v. Hellman, supra, page 237, 48 S. Ct. page 245, and in the light of their legislative history. Moreover, every deduction from gross income is allowed as a matter of legislative grace, and 'only as there is clear provision therefor can any particular deduction be allowed. ... A taxpayer seeking a deduction must be able to point to an applicable statute and show that he comes within its terms.' New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 435, 440\n, 54 S.Ct. 788, 790. \n\n[305 \nU.S. 281, 293]\n\u00a0\n We have considered, but find it unnecessary to discuss, other arguments of petitioners of lesser moment.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice BUTLER, and Mr. Justice ROBERTS dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The enumerated exceptions, none of which are applicable in the present case, relate to specified types of gains or losses upon exchange of property, some of which are excluded from the recognition accorded generally by the section to such gains and losses. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The method of computing capital gains under  101 is in substance that of  111, 112 and 113, 26 U.S.C.A.  111-113, which is identified by  22 and 23, 26 U.S.C.A.  22, 23, with that prescribed for ascertaining the gain to a stockholder upon corporate liquidation by  115. By  22(d), 26 U.S.C.A.  22(d), it is provided: 'Distributions by corporations shall be taxable to the shareholders as provided in section 115'; and '(e) In the case of a sale or other disposition of property, the gain or loss shall be computed as provided in sections 111, 112, and 113.' 26 U.S.C.A.  22. Section 101, 26 U.S.C.A.  101, in terms provides that \" Capital deductions' means such deductions as are allowed by section 23 for the purpose of computing net income, and are properly allocable to or chargeable against capital assets sold or exchanged during the taxable year.' And  23(g), 45 Stat. 800, provides: 'The basis for determining the amount of deduction for losses sustained ... shall be the same as is provided in section 113 for determining the gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Sec. 12(c), 45 Stat. 797: 'Capital net gains and losses.-For rate and computation of tax in lieu of normal and surtax in case of net incomes of not less than $30,000, approximately, or in case of net incomes, excluding items of capital gain, capital loss, and capital deductions, of not less than $30,000, approximately, see section 101.'\n Only in the case of incomes in excess of $30,000, approximately, do the aggregate of the normal and surtax exceed the 12 1\/2% rate provided for in  101. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Section 201(c) of the 1918 Act, omitted from the 1921 Act, was continued, so far as now relevant, in the form in which it later appeared in  115(c) of the Act of 1928, as  201(c) of the 1924 and 1926 Acts, 43 Stat. 254, 44 Stat. 10, and as  115(c) of the 1932 and 1934 Acts, 26 U.S. C.A.  115. The provisions of  101 for computing capital gains or losses upon sales or exchanges and taxing them on a different basis from ordinary income first appeared as  206 of the Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 232, which was continued as  208 of the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926, 43 Stat. 262, 44 Stat. 19, and as  101 of the Revenue Acts of 1928 and 1932, 26 U. S.C.A.  101. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Report of the Senate Committee on Finance (Report No. 398, 68th Cong., 1st Sess.) states at page 11: '... The bill treats a liquidating dividend as a sale of the stock, with the result that the gain to the taxpayer is treated not as a dividend subject only to the surtax but as a gain from the sale of property which may be treated as a capital gain. The treatment of liquidating dividends under the bill is substantially the same as provided for in the revenue act of 1918. A liquidating dividend is, in effect, a sale by the stockholder of his stock to the corporation; he surrenders his interest in the corporation and receives money in place thereof. Treating such a transaction as a sale and within the capital gain provisions is consistent with the entire theory of the act and, furthermore, is the only method of treating such distributions which can be easily administered.'\n The Report of the House Ways and Means Committee (Report No. 179, 68th Cong., 1st Sess.) states with respect to  201(c), at page 11: '... the Treasury has construed the existing law as taxing liquidating dividends, not as capital gains, but as dividends subject to the surtax rates. The proposed bill, as did the 1918 act, treats a liquidating dividend as a sale of the stock to the corporation and recognizes the true effect of such a distribution.' \n\n\n\n\n","185":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWIESE v.

In re Wright, Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., 91 F. 2d 894. The judgments affirmed two orders of the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Indiana, entered there in proceedings under section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  203, instituted by Wright.\n The earlier order approved the recommendation of the Conciliation Commissioner to strike certain described real estate from the debtor's schedules and the later \n\n[304 \nU.S. 502, 504]\n\u00a0\n order refused to permit the debtor to amend the schedules by showing the circumstances under which the debtor claimed an interest in the same real estate covered by the earlier motion. The correctness of the orders depends largely upon the constitutional validity of certain provisions of section 75(n) of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended by section 4 of the Act of August 28, 1935, 49 Stat. 942, 11 U.S.C.A.  203(n). These provisions, held unconstitutional by the lower court, operate to extend the period of redemption from a foreclosure sale allowed the mortgagor under state law. To decide this important constitutional question, our writs of certiorari were issued. In view of section 1 of the Act of August 24, 1937, c. 754, 28 U.S.C.  401, 28 U.S.C.A.  401,1 enacted subsequent to the decision of the case below, the Court certified to the Attorney General the fact that the constitutionality of an Act of Congress affecting the public interest was drawn in question in this cause. The Attorney General disclaimed intention to intervene.\n The controversy as to whether or not the land in question was subject to the administration of the court of bankruptcy had its origin in this plexus of facts. Petitioner James M. Wrigh on Oct ober 1, 1925, together with his wife, executed a mortgage to respondent com- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 502, 505]\n\u00a0\n pany on a tract of land in Indiana, containing 80.31 acres, to secure a note of $3,000. At the same time, the same parties executed another mortgage to the respondent on a different tract of land containing 200 acres, also in Indiana, to secure a note of $9,000. In 1931, the first tract was deeded to petitioner's son, and three separate forty-acre parcels from the second tract were deeded to his wife, daughter and son-in- law respectively. The property was conveyed subject to definite portions of the indebtedness but without an assumption of any of the obligation by the grantees.\n On January 3, 1934, respondent brought suit to foreclose the smaller mortgage, joining as defendants petitioner and his son. Judgment of foreclosure was entered, June 9, 1934, and on July 12,1934, the 80.31-acre tract was sold, on the foreclosure sale, to respondent. Respondent received a duly executed sheriff's certificate of sale. Delivery of final deed was delayed in view of the one-year period of redemption allowed to mortgagors by Indiana statute. Ind.Ann.Stat., Burns' 1933,  2-3909, 2- 4001\n\n\n Wright filed a petition under section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act, October 29, 1934. In listing his property on his schedules, he set forth all 280.31 acres, despite his previous conveyances of 200.31 acres. On December 19, 1934, stating that no agreement of creditors could be had, he amended his petition under section 75(s), asking to be adjudged a bankrupt. 2 On April 13, 1935, petitioner's son \n\n[304 \nU.S. 502, 506]\n\u00a0\n and daughter and their spouses delivered to him a quitclaim deed for all the property, 200.31 acres, he had previously deeded to them and his wife. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n On May 27, 1935, respondent obtained a personal judgment against petitioner on the $9,000 note, and a decree of foreclosure of the 200-acre tract, which respondent purchased at the sheriff's sale on July 20, 1935, receiving a certificate of sale. On August 2, 1935, petitioner's one-year period for redeeming from sale the 80.31-acre tract having expired July 12, 1935, respondent surrendered its certificate of sale and received a sheriff's deed to this land.\n On October 11, 1935, petitioner amended his petition as authorized by section 75(s) of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended August 28, 1935, 11 U.S.C. A.  203(s) following the invalidation by the decision in Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, \n295 \nU.S. 555\n, 55 S.Ct. 854, 97 A.L.R. 1106, of section 75(s) as originally drafted, 48 Stat. 1289, 11 U.S. C.A.  203(s) and again asked to be adjudged a bankrupt.\n On July 20, 1936, the one-year redemption period having expired, respondent received from the sheriff a final deed for the 200-acre tract. On July 29, 1936, respondent filed a motion in the District Court for Northern Indiana, where the proceedings under section 75(s) were pending, to strike from petitioner's schedules, which had been filed October 29, 1934, these 280.31 acres of land.\n On December 14, 1936, the District Court granted this motion, and entered an appropriate order. Apparently the order struck from the schedules eighty acres still owned by Wright in October, 1934, and properly scheduled at that time. Later in December, 1936, petitioner asked leave to amend his schedules to set forth the reconveyances by his children on April 13, 1935. On December 1, 1936 , the District Court denied the application to amend the schedules. Petitioner appealed from \n\n[304 \nU.S. 502, 507]\n\u00a0\n both orders of the District Court, striking the land from the schedules and denying leave to amend. The appeals were consolidated in the Circuit Court of Appeals. As stated in the opening paragraph of this opinion, that court affirmed both orders of the District Court. These judgments are under review here.\n A further aspect of the controversy between petitioner and respondent may be noted. On September 13, 1935, prior to the debtor's filing of an amended petition under section 75(s) as amended, respondent instituted an action in the state court for possession of the 80.31 acres. A judgment overruling a defense grounded on the bankruptcy proceedings, and awarding possession and damages to respondent, was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Indiana on April 2, 1937. Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., 7 N.E.2d 206. A similar judgment with respect to the rest of the land was affirmed October 26, 1937, Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., Ind.Sup., 10 N.E. 2d 726. By temporary restraining order of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and subsequent stay of mandate, respondent has been restrained from taking possession of the land.\n First. (a). By October 30, 1934, when petitioner sought adjustment and extension of debts under section 75, the 80.31-acre tract had been deeded away to petitioner's son. Accordingly, although this tract was listed on petitioner's schedules, it did not at that time pass into the hands of the bankruptcy court for administration. Nor was the amended petition under section 75(s), filed on December 19, 1934, any more effective in bringing the tract within the purview of the bankruptcy court. On April 13, 1935, the members of Wright's family relinquished all their right and interest in his lands, including this 80.31-acre tract, so that petitioner then acquired an interest in the land. But Wright's receipt of this gift of land was not effective in and of itself to bring the land within the control of the bankruptcy court. This \n\n[304 \nU.S. 502, 508]\n\u00a0\n is the rule applicable to property received by a bankrupt subsequent to the filing of an ordinary petition in bankruptcy,4 and we see no reason why the same rule should not apply to debtor proceedings under section 75. 5\n There is no substance in any contention that this 80.31-acre tract was brought within the purview of the bankruptcy court by the Act of August 28, 1935, amending section 75(s), 11 U.S.C.A.  203(s), or the filing of an amended petition under this section on October 11, 1935. Prior thereto, judgment of foreclosure had been entered in the state court and a judicial sale (at which respondent bought in the 80.31-acre tract) held on July 12, 1934. Conveyance and delivery of possession to the purchaser was deferred for one year, the period of redemption under thestatute  of Indiana. This period expired on July 12, 1935, and the sheriff's deed was executed on August 2, 1935. With the delivery of the deed, prior to any effective extension of the period of redemption, the purchaser's rights, flowing from the judicial sale, were no longer affected by the court's jurisdiction of petitioner and petitioner's \n\n[304 \nU.S. 502, 509]\n\u00a0\n estate under the Bankruptcy Act. \n6\n Nothing in section 75 as it now stands indicates any intention that the bankruptcy courts assume control over land not previously within the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court, and already completely divorced from any title of the debtor.\n\n\n (b)\n. On October 29, 1934, when Wright filed his original petition under section 75, he was undoubtedly the owner of 80 acres out of the 200- acre tract. He had never conveyed away these 80 acres; no proceedings to foreclose them had been begun. These 80 acres were clearly within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, but we shall not give them separate discussion, for they are controlled a fortiori by our ruling with respect to the other 120 acres out of the 200-acre tract.\n\n\n (c)\n. The status of these 120 acres, deeded in forty-acre parcels, to three members of the family, is governed by other facts. These parcels passed to the other members of the family prior to the filing of the petition for composition on October 29, 1934. Petitioner, however, included them in his schedules. The grantees had title on December 19, 1934, when petitioner filed his first amendment to the petition for composition. On April 13, 1935, these parcels were reconveyed to petitioner; on May 27 judgment for foreclosure was entered and on July 20, 1935, a sale was had. Respondent became the purchaser. The right of redemption expired July 20, 1936. Between the sale and the expiration of the period of redemption, two events occurred. The Congress enacted the Act of August 28, 1935, which added to the Bankruptcy Act, section 75, a new subsection (s) to take the \n\n[304 \nU.S. 502, 510]\n\u00a0\n place of the subsection (s) held invalid in Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, \n295 \nU.S. 555\n, 55 S.Ct. 854, 97 A.L.R. 1106. This new subsection (s) was sustained in Wright v. Vinton Branch of Mountain Trust Bank, \n300 \nU.S. 440\n, 57 S.Ct. 556, 112 A.L.R. 1455. Secondly, the petitioner, on October 11, 1935, filed a second amendment to his petition for composition and was 'duly adjudged a bankrupt.' Both of these events are significant in reasoning out the status of the 120 acres.\n If the rule of the General Bankruptcy Act is followed, property acquired after the filing of a petition for composition under the provisions of section 75 would not be subject to bankruptcy administration. Section 75(n) in effect at the time of the filing of the petition leads to the conclusion that, at that time, a similar rule, as to property subsequently acquired, would apply. \n7\n At the time petitioner filed his first amendment, seeking to be adjudged a bankrupt, subsection (n) continued in the same form. It was changed by the Act of August 28, 1935, to the language shown below. \n8\n By the terms of the second and \n\n[304 \nU.S. 502, 511]\n\u00a0\n third paragraphs of section 4 of that Act, all rights of redemption of petitioner which had not expired in land within the jurisdiction of the court of bankruptcy were extended. By the earlier subsection (n) the line of cleavage, between property subject to the bankruptcy jurisdiction and property free from it, came at the date when the 'farmer's petition or answer was filed.' When this language was adopted there was no provision for a petition in bankruptcy under section 75. There was provision only for a petition for compositin or ex tension. \n9\n By section 4 of the Act of\n___ In proceedings under this section, except as otherwise provided herein, the jurisdiction and powers of the courts, the title, powers, and duties of its officers, the duties of the farmer, and the rights and liabilities of creditors, and of all persons with respect to the property of the farmer and the jurisdiction of the appellate courts, shall be the same as if a voluntary petition for adjudication had been filed and a decree of adjudication had been entered on the day when the farmer's petition, asking to be adjudged a bankrupt, was filed with the clerk of court or left with the conciliaton comm issioner for the purpose of forwarding same to the clerk of court.' 11 U.S.C.A.  203(n).\n 9 Act of March 3, 1933, section 75(c), 11 U.S.C.A.  203(c):\n'(c) At any time within five years after this section takes effect ( March 3, 1933), a petition may be filed by any farmer, stating that the farmer is insolvent or unable to meet his debts as they mature, and that it is desirable to effect a composition or an extension of time to pay his debts. The petition or answer of the farmer shall be accompanied by his schedules. The petition and answer shall be filed with the court, but shall, on request of the farmer or creditor, be received by the conciliation commissioner for the county in which the farmer resides and promptly transmitted by him to the clerk of the court for filing. If any such petition is filed, an order of adjudication shall not be entered except as provided hereinafter in this section.' \n\n[304 \nU.S. 502, 512]\n\u00a0\n August 28, 1935, subsection (n) was changed to comport with subsection 75( s), permitting a petitioner to amend and ask 'to be adjudged a bankrupt.' We are of the opinion that it is the date of filing this request for adjudication as bankrupt which fixes 'the line of cleavage' as to the property. This conclusion is really in conformity with the reasoning governing the rule in the General Bankruptcy Act. There the first petition seeks an adjudication in bankruptcy. Under section 75, it is only the later amendment which does. \n10\n As the 120 acres had been reconveyed to the petitioner prior to his filing of the petition of October 11, 1935, seeking adjudication as a bankrupt, his interest in the 120 acres was subject to bankruptcy jurisdiction. As the land was reconveyed to the petitioner prior to the decree of foreclosure, petitioner was an owner entitled to redeem after the sale. Ind.Stat.Ann., Burns' 1933, c. 40,  2- 4001 et seq. The amendment of October 11, 1935, was the first opportunity to bring the 120 acres \n\n[304 \nU.S. 502, 513]\n\u00a0\n into the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court, and we think it had that effect.\n\n Second. The conclusion that all the lands in controversy, except the 80.31-acre tract, are within the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court under the petitioner's amendment asking to be adjudged a bankrupt and are lands, subject to petitioner's right of redemption, as extended by subsection (n) of section 75, requires the reversal of the judgments below, as to these lands, unless the provisions of section 75(n), extending the period of redemption, are unconstitutional. Respondent insists that these provisions are a direct invasion of the state's rights under the Tenth Amendment, U.S.C.A. Const. Amend. 10, and violative of the respondent's own rights, by virtue of its title acquired by purchase at the judicial sale, in contravention of the Fifth Amendment, U.S.C.A. Const. Amend. 5.\n The right of the Congress to legislate on the subject of bankruptcies is granted by the Constitution in general terms. 'The Congress shall have Power ... To establish ... uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States,' Article 1,  8, cl. 4. U.S.C.A. Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 4. To this specific grant, there must be added the powers of the general grant of clause eighteen. 'To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers .... ' The subject of bankruptcies is incapable of final definition. The concept changes. It has been recognized that it is not limited to the connotation of the phrase in England or the States, at the time of the formulation of the Constitution. 11 An adjudication in bankruptcy is not essential to the jurisdiction. The subject of bankruptcies is nothing less than 'the subject of the relations between an insolvent or nonpaying or fraudulent debtor, and his \n\n[304 \nU.S. 502, 514]\n\u00a0\n creditors, extending to his and their relief.' \n12\n This definition of Judge Blatchford, afterwards a member of this Court, has been cited with approval here. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n The development of bankruptcy legislation has been towards relieving the honest debtor from oppressive indebtedness and permitting him to start afresh. 14 By the Act of March 3, 1933, 11 U.S.C.A.  201 et seq., the Congress deliberately undertook the rehabilitation of the debtor as well as his discharge from indebtedness. \n15\n This legislation for rehabilitation has been upheld as within the subject of bankruptcies. \n16\n But respondent urges that under the Bankruptcy Clause Congress is confined to legislation for the adjustment of the debtor-creditor relationship, and insists that the purchaser at an Indiana judicial sale is not a creditor but a grantee with rights acquired by the purchase, separate and distinct from the rights and obligations arising from the creation of the debt. While there may be no relation of debtor and creditor between the bankrupt and the purchaser of his property at judicial sale, we think the purchaser at a judicial sale does enter into the radius of the bankruptcy power over debts. His purchase is in the liquidation of the indebtedness. The debtor has a right of redemption of which the purchaser is advised, and until that right of redemption expires the rights of the purchaser are subject to the power of the Congress over the relationship of debtor and creditor and its power to legislate for the rehabilitation of the debtor. The person whose land has been sold at fore- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 502, 515]\n\u00a0\n closure sale and now holds a right of redemption is, for all practical purposes, in the same debt situation as an ordinary mortgagor in default; both are faced with the same ultimate prospect, either of paying a certain sum of money, or of being completely divested of their land. We think the provision for the extension of the period of redemption comes clearly within the power of the Congress under the bankruptcy clause. But respondent presses a further argument that the Fifth and Tenth Amendments are violated.\n\n\n (a)\n The Fifth Amendment is said to be violated and the property of respondent, the purchaser at the judicial sale, taken without due process, 17 by the provision for extension of the time of redemption. Section 75(n), 11 U.S.C.A.  203(n), provides that 'the period of redemption shall be extended ... for the period necessary for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section.' The stay may be approved for the period during which the debtor seeks to effect a composition,18 and, as contemplated by section 75(s), for a moratorium period not exceeding three years, during which the court's equitable supervision over the land continues, and a reasonable rental is required. \n19\n That such an extension is consonant with the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment is indicated by our decision in Home Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398\n, 54 S.Ct. 231, 88 A.L.R. 1481, where we held that neither the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment nor the contracts clause were violated by an emergency state statute authorizing extension of the period of redemption from foreclosure sales, for a just and equitable period not exceeding two years, conditioned on payment by the mortgagor of a reasonable rental, as directed by the court. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 502, 516]\n\u00a0\n The mortgage contract was made subject to constitutional power in the Congress to legislate on the subject of bankruptcies. Impliedly, this was written into the contract between petitioner and respondent. 'Not only are existing laws read into contracts in order to fix obligations as between the parties, but the reservation of essential attributes of sovereign power is also read into contracts as a postulate of the legal order.' \n20\n And the fact that in this case the purchaser at the foreclosure sale was also the mortgagee is not a determining factor. Any purchaser at a judicial sale must purchase subject to the possibility of the exercise of the bankruptcy power in a manner consonant with the Fifth Amendment.\n We have held that section 75(s) does not unconstitutionally affect the rights of the mortgagee. \n21\n We do not think the provision for extension of the period of redemption in section 75(n) is invalid. The rights of the purchaser are preserved, the possibility of enjoyment is merely delayed. The rights of a purchaser, who under the state law is entitled to the redemption money or possession within a year, are not substantially different from those of a mortgagee entitled, on the maturity of the obligation, to payment or sale of the property.\n\n\n (b)\n In view of our decision that the law is within the bankruptcy power, scant reliance can be placed on the Tenth Amendment. Respondent argues that to subject property bought in at a foreclosure sale to the extended redemption period and other provisions of section 75(s) 'would be a direct invasion of the powers reserved to the State by the Constitution, and a violation of (respondent's) property rights theretofore determined by the courts of the State of Indiana in accordance with the law of that State.' \n\n[304 \nU.S. 502, 517]\n\u00a0\n If the argument is that Congress has no power to alter property rights, because the regulation of rights in property is a matter reserved to the States, it is futile. Bankruptcy proceedings constantly modify and affect the property rights established by state law. A familiar instance is the invalidation of transfers working a preference, though valid under state law when made. Recent decisions illustrate other instances:\n'A court of bankruptcy may affect the interests of lienholders in many ways. To carry out the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act, it may direct that all liens upon property forming part of a bankrupt's estate be marshaled; or that the property be sold free of encumbrances and the rights of all lienholders be transferred to the proceeds of the sale. Van Huffel v. Harkelrode, \n284 \nU.S. 225, 227\n, 52 S.Ct. 115, 78 A. L.R. 453. Despite the peremptory terms of a pledge, it may enjoin sale of the collateral, if it finds that the sale would hinder or delay preparation or consummation of a plan of reorganization. Continental Illinois Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, R.I. & P. Ry. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 648, 680\n, 681 S., 55 S.Ct. 595. It may enjoin like action by a mortgagee which would defeat the purpose of (section 75) subsection (s) to effect rehabilitation of the farmer mortgagor.' Wright v. Vinton Branch of Mountain Trust Bank, \n300 \nU.S. 440\n, at page 470, 57 S.Ct. 556, 565, 112 A.L.R. 1455.22\n\n Such action does not indicate a disregard of the property rights created by state law. The state law still establishes the norm to which Congress must substantially adhere; a serious departure from this norm, i. e., fom the quality of the property rights created by the state courts, has led to condemnation of the federal action as constituting a deprivation of property without due process. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n[304 \nU.S. 502, 518]\n\u00a0\n Property rights do not gain any absolute inviolability in the bankruptcy court because created and protected by state law. Most property rights are so created and protected. But if Congress is acting within its bankruptcy power, it may authorize the bankruptcy court to affect these property rights, provided the limitations of the due process clause are observed.\n In so far as the judgments below struck from the schedules the 80.31- acre tract and refused to permit amendment to show the character of appellant's interest, they are affirmed. As to the rest of the land in question, they are reversed.\n It is so ordered.\n Affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing Denied 59 S.Ct. 56, 83 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Whenever the constitutionality of any Act of Congress affecting the public interest is drawn in question in any court of the United States in any suit or proceeding to which the United States, or any agency thereof, or any officer or employee thereof, as such officer or employee, is not a party, the court having jurisdiction of the suit or proceeding shall certify such fact to the Attorney General. In any such case the court shall permit the United States to intervene and become a party for presentation of evidence (if evidence is otherwise receivable in such suit or proceeding) and argument upon the question of the constitutionality of such Act.

Petitioner's answer to respondent's motion to strike out from the schedules the real estate in controversy alleges 'that all the steps under said section 75 were taken; that later petitioner (Wright) amended his petition under subsection (s) of section 75, as amended August 28, 1935.' By stipulation the allegations of the answer were admitted as evidence. There is apparently no issue as to the fact of the filing of a petition in bankruptcy on December 19, 1934. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Apparently his wife had died in the meanwhile.

UNITED STATES(1938)\nNo. 37\nArgued: November 16, 1937Decided: January 17, 1938\n\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 584]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ashby Williams, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Sam E. Whitaker, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 585]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether Senate Bill 713, 74th Congress, 1st session, which was passed by both Houses of Congress, became a law.\n The bill was presented to the President of the United States on Friday, April 24, 1936. It had originated in the Senate. On Monday, May 4, 1936, the Senate took a recess until noon, Thursday, May 7, 1936. The House of Representatives remained in session. On May 5, 1936, the President returned the bill with a message addressed to the Senate setting forth his objections. The bill and message were delivered to the Secretary of the Senate. When the Senate reconvened on May 7, 1936, the Secretary advised the Senate of the return of the bill and the delivery of the President's message. \n1\n On the same day \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 586]\n\u00a0\n the President of the Senate laid before it the Secretary's letter and the message of the President of the United States. The message was read and with the bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Claims. No further action was taken.\n The bill granted jurisdiction to the Court of Claims to rehear and adjudicate petitioner's claim against the United States. Accordingly, on September 14, 1936, petitioner presented his petition to the Court of Claims. The Government opposed the petition upon the ground that the bill had never become a law and the Court of Claims denied the petition. In view of the importance of the question certiorari was granted. \n301 \nU.S. 681\n, 57 S.Ct. 939\n\n\n The applicable provisions of the Constitution are found in article 1 ,  7, par. 2, which provides: 'Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by Yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 587]\n\u00a0\n Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.'\n\n 1. \nThe first question is whether 'the Congress by their adjournment' prevented the return of the bill by the President within the period of ten days allowed for that purpose.\n'The Congress' did not adjourn. The Senate alone was in recess. The Constitution creates and defines 'the Congress.' It consists 'of a Senate and House of Representatives.' Article 1,  1. The Senate is not 'the Congress.'\n\n The context of the clause itself points the distinction. It speaks of the 'House of Representatives' and of the 'Senate,' respectively. It speaks of the return of the bill, if the President does not approve it, 'to that House in which it shall have originated'; of reconsideration by 'that House,' and, in case two thirds of 'that House' agree to pass the bill, of sending it together with the President's objections to the 'other House' and, if approved by two thirds of 'that House,' the bill is to become a law. Provision is made for the taking of the votes of 'both Houses' and for the recording of the names of those voting for and against the bill on the Journal 'of each House respectively.'\n Then, after this precise use of terms and careful differentiation, the concluding clause describes not an adjournment of either House as a separate body, or an adjournment of the House in which the bill shall have originated, but the adjournment of 'the Congress.' It cannot be supposed that the framers of the Constitution did not use this expression with deliberation or failed to appre- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 588]\n\u00a0\n ciate its plain significance. The reference to the Congress is manifestly to the entire legislative body consisting of both Houses. Nowhere in the Constitution are the words 'the Congress' used to describe a single House.\n To disregard such a deliberate choice of words and their natural meaning would be a departure from the first principle of constitutional interpretation. 'In expounding the Constitution of the United States,' said Chief Justice Taney in Holmes v. Jennison, 14 Pet. 540, 570, 571, 614, 'every word must have its due force, and appropriate meaning; for it is evident from the whole instrument, that no word was unnecessarily used, or needlessly added. The many discussions which have taken place upon the construction of the constitution, have proved the correctness of this proposition; and shown the high talent, the caution, and the foresight of the illustrious men who framed it. Every word appears to have been weighed with the utmost deliberation, and its force and effect to have been fully understood.' See, also, Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 333, 334; Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 316; Myers v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 52, 151\n, 47 S.Ct. 21, 37; Williams v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 553, 572\n, 573 S., 53 S.Ct. 751, 757.\n The argument addressed to the word 'their' in the phrase 'the Congress by their adjournment,' is futile. The argument is that the use of the plural would not be unusual or inappropriate if the reference were to a single House. There is no question that both singular and plural forms are used in the Constitution with reference to each House separately. See article 1,  3, pars. 2, 4, 5, 6; Article 1,  5, pars. 1, 2, 3. The plural is used in the phrase 'their Journal' in the paragraph under consideration. But the question is not whether the use of the plural is inappropriate in referring to a single House or its members. It is sufficient to say that there is certainly no inappropriateness in the use of the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 589]\n\u00a0\n plural in relation to 'the Congress' as composed of both Houses, and that use in no way changes the significance of that term.\n The phrasing of the concluding clause is entirely free from ambiguity, and there is no occasion for construction.\n\n 2. \nThe argument to the contrary rests upon the premise that a bill cannot be returned by the President to the House in which it originated when that House during the session of Congress is in recess, and hence that the concluding clause of paragraph 2 of section 7 of Article 1, referring to an adjournment by the Congress, should be rephrased by judicial construction in order to deal with that situation. We think that the premise is faulty and the rephrasing inadmissible.\n Paragraph 4 of section 5 of article 1 provides: 'Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.'\n It will be observed that this provision is for a short recess by one House without the consent of the other 'during the Session of Congress.' Plainly the taking of such a recess is not an adjournment by the Congress. The 'Session of Congress' continues.\n Here, the recess of the Senate from May 4th to May 7th was during the session of Congress and under that provision. In returning the bill to the Senate by delivery to its Secretary during the recess there was no violation of any express requirement of the Constitution. The Constitution does not define what shall constitute a return of a bill or deny the use of appropriate agencies in effecting the return.\n Nor was there any practical difficulty in making the return of the bill during the recess. The organization of the Senate continued and was intact. The Secretary \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 590]\n\u00a0\n of the Senate was functioning and was able to receive, and did receive, the bill. Under the constitutional provision the Senate was required to reconvene in not more than three days and thus would be able to act with reasonable promptitude upon the President's objections. There is no greater difficult in returning a bill to one of the two Houses when it is in recess during the session of Congress than in presenting a bill to the President by sending it to the White House in his temporary absence. Such a presentation is familiar practice. The bill is sent by a messenger and is received by the President. It is returned by a messenger, and why may it not be received by the accredited agent of the legislative body? To say that the President cannot return a bill when the House in which it originated is in recess during the session of Congress, and thus afford an opportunity for the passing of the bill over the President's objections, is to ignore the plainest practical considerations and by implying a requirement of an artificial formality to erect a barrier to the exercise of a constitutional right.\n These practical considerations were well put by Mr. Hatton W. Sumners in his argument as amicus curiae on behalf of the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives in the Pocket Veto Case, \n279 \nU.S. 655\n, 49 S.Ct. 463, 467, 64 A.L.R. 1434. He said: 'There is no language in the provision governing this passing of bills between the President and Congress, or any recognized rule of construction which, while permitting the Congress in the first instance to send bills to the President by a messenger, as is done without question, and the President to receive such bills through an appropriate agent even when himself absent from his office; and the President, though he may be away from the Capitol, at the time returning the bill by messenger to the Congress, though the Constitution declares 'he', the President, shall return it, which would prevent the House of origin \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 591]\n\u00a0\n from receiving these same bills through a proper agent if that House were engaged in other business or temporarily absent from their Chambers. It is against all reason and every recognized rule of construction, when the avoidance of unnecessary delay is so clearly manifest in the provision sought to be construed, that a construction should be superimposed which would make for delay regardless of every desire and of every effort of the President and of the Congress in the situation indicated.'\n And referring to the provision of the Constitution above quoted as to adjournments by either House for not more than three days during the session of Congress, he said: 'In such a situation what is to occur? Is the bill to become a law despite the objections of the President? The Congress has not adjourned, and yet the President cannot make return of the bill to the House of its origin in session because it is not in session. Is the bill to die with the Congress in existence, possibly the House of origin only having adjourned earlier than usual on the last day permitted for the return of the bill? Is there no rational construction of the Constitution possible which will make effective all the safeguards with regard to legislation established in the Constitution, and yet make operative under every circumstance, the general plan set up by the Constitution?'\n And, again, with respect to the agencies of the Houses of Congress, Mr. Sumners observed that: 'The Houses of Congress have officers and agents of great power and responsibility who act in their stead, and who are constantly in their places when the Houses are in session, and when they are not in session.' He found 'nothing in the Constitution which denies the right to the use of these agents in effecting the return of objected-to bills.' He added that:\n'A rule of construction or of official action which would require in every instance the persons who constitute the \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 592]\n\u00a0\n Houses of Congress to be in formal session in order to receive bills from the President would also require the person who is President personally to return such bills. ...\n\n'The right of constructive delivery is necessarily not only to facilitate legislative procedure, prevent delay, and to hold the President's powers within the limits imposed by the Constitution, but it is also necessary in order to hold the Congress within proper bounds by preventing bills to which the President may object from becoming law without reconsideration by the Congress.\n\n'The adjournment of a House for not more than three days, without the consent of the other House is not an adjournment of Congress.\n\n'If the Senate should be in executive session, on a matter of the highest public importance, refusing to be interrupted, on the last day of the period in which return may be made, that would not even be an adjournment of one House of the Congress; and yet return could not be made if constructive delivery is not permitted.\n\n'It could not be held that Congress was adjourned when the Senate was in executive session performing its constitutional duty, and the other House in actual session. The sensible thing to do in such a case, would be for the messenger of the President, finding himself unable to make delivery to the Senate, to make the delivery to the Secretary of the Senate. There is nothing in the Constitution to prohibit that being done.'\n\n The absence of any practical obstacle to the return of a bill when a House is in temporary recess during the session of the Congress is illustrated by what was done in this instance. The Senate was in recess from May 4th to noon of May 7th. The President's time for consideration expired on May 6th. He delivered the bill with his objections to the Secretary of the Senate on May 5th. The Secretary presented the bill with the President's ob- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 593]\n\u00a0\n jections to the President of the Senate on May 7th, and on that day the bill and the objections were laid before the Senate and were referred to the appropriate committee. The fact that Mr. Sumners' contention in the Pocket Veto Case was unavailing with respect to the effect of an adjournment of the Congress at the close of its first regular session, in no way detracts from the pertinence and cogency of these observations as addressed to the situation which is now presented.\n\n 3. \nThe chief, if not the sole, reliance for the argument that the bill could not be returned by the President during the Senate's recess is our decision in the Pocket Veto Case, supra. We do not regard that decision as applicable for two reasons: (1) The present question was not involved; and (2) the reasoning of the decision is inapposite to the circumstances of this case.\n In the Pocket Veto Case, the Congress had adjourned. The question was whether the concluding clause of paragraph 2 of section 7 of article 1 was limited to a final adjournment of the Congress or embraced an adjournment of the Congress at the close of the first regular session. The Court held that the clause was not so limited and applied to the latter. In interpreting the word 'adjournment,' and in referring to other provisions of the Constitution using the word 'adjourn,' the Court was still addressing itself to a case where there had been an adjournment by the Congress. The Court did not decide, and there was no occasion for ruling, that the clause applies where the Congress has not adjourned and a temporary recess has been taken by one House during the session of Congress. Any observations which could be regarded as having a bearing upon the question now before us would be taken out of their proper relation. The oft-repeated admonition of Chief Justice Marshall, 'that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used,' and that if \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 594]\n\u00a0\n they go 'beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit, when the very point is presented for decision,' has special force in this instance. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399.\n In the Pocket Veto Case, the Court expressed the view that the House to which the bill is to be returned 'is the House in session,' and that no return can be made to the House when it is not in session as a collective body and its members are dispersed. But that expression should not be construed so narrowly as to demand that the President must select a precise moment when the House is within the walls of its chambers and that a return is absolutely impossible during a recess however temporary. Such a conclusion, as we shall presently endeavor to show, would frustrate the fundamental purposes of the constitutional provision as to action upon bills. The Court in the Pocket Veto Case was impressed with the impropriety of a delivery of the bill by the President during a period of adjournment 'to some individual officer or agent not authorized to make any legislative record of its delivery, who should hold it in his own hands for days, weeks or perhaps months,-not only leaving open possible questions as to the date on which it had been delivered to him, or whether it had in fact been delivered to him at all, but keeping the bill in the meantime in a state of suspended animation until the House resumes its sittings, with no certain knowledge on the part of the public as to whether it had or had not been seasonably delivered, and necessarily causing delay in its reconsideration which the Constitution evidently intended to avoid.' 'In short,' said the Court, 'it was plainly the object of the constitutional provision that there should be a timely return of the bill, which should not only be a matter of official record definitely shown by the journal of the House itself, giving public, certain and prompt knowledge as \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 595]\n\u00a0\n to the status of the bill, but should enable Congress to proceed immediately with its reconsideration; and that the return of the bill should be an actual and public return to the House itself, and not a fictitious return by a delivery of the bill to some individual which could be given a retroactive effect at a later date when the time for the return of the bill to the House had expired.' Id. \n279 \nU.S. 655\n, at pages 684, 685, 49 S.Ct. 463, 468, 64 A.L.R. 1434.\n These statements show clearly the sort of dangers which the Court envisaged. However real these dangers may be when Congress has adjourned and the members of its Houses have dispersed at the end of a session, the situation with which the Court was dealing, they appear to be illusory when there is a mere temporary recess. Each House for its convenience, and during its session and the session of Congress, may take, and frequently does take, a brief recess limited, as we have seen, in the absence of the consent of the other House, to a period of three days. In such case there is no withholding of the bill from appropriate legislative record for weeks or perhaps months, no keeping of the bill in a state of suspended animation with no certain knowledge on the part of the public whether it was seasonably delivered, no causing of any undue delay in its reconsideration. When there is nothing but such a temporary recess the organization of the House and its appropriate officers continue to function without interruption, the bill is properly safeguarded for a very limited time, and is promptly reported and may be reconsidered immediately after the short recess is over. The prospect that in such a case the public may not be promptly and properly informed of the return of the bill with the President's objections, or that the bill will not be properly safeguarded or duly recorded upon the journal of the House, or that it will not be subject to reasonably prompt action by the House, is, we think, wholly chimerical. If we regard the manifest realities of the situation, we cannot fail to see that a brief recess by one House, such \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 596]\n\u00a0\n as is permitted by the Constitution without the consent of the other House, during the session of Congress, does not constitute such an interruption of the session of the House as to give rise to the dangers which, as the Court apprehended, might develop after the Congress has adjourned.\n\n 4. \nThe constitutional provisions have two fundamental purposes; (1) That the President shall have suitable opportunity to consider the bills presented to him; and (2) that the Congress shall have suitable opportunity to consider his objections to bills and on such consideration to pass them over his veto provided there are the requisite votes. Edwards v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 482, 486\n, 52 S.Ct. 627, 628. We should not adopt a construction which would frustrate either of these purposes.\n As to the President's opportunity for consideration, we have held that he may still approve bills and that they will become laws, if he acts within the time allotted for that purpose, although Congress meanwhile has adjourned. La Abra Silver Mining Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 423\n, 20 S. Ct. 168; Edwards v. United States, supra. It is to safeguard the President's opportunity that paragraph 2 of section 7 of article 1 provides that bills which he does not approve shall not become laws if the adjournment of the Congress prevents their return. Edwards v. United States, supra.\n Where the President does not approve a bill, the plan of the Constitution is to give to the Congress the opportunity to consider his objections and to pass the bill despite his disapproval. It is for this purpose that the time limit for return is fixed. This opportunity is as important as that of the President. But if the return of a bill is impossible during a temporary recess of a House while Congress is in session, either the President may be obliged to cut short the time for his consideration so as to be sure to get his objections before the House while it is within the walls of its chambers, or, if the President takes the allotted time and attempts to return \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 597]\n\u00a0\n the bill during the recess, his objections will either be unavailing or the Congress will be denied opportunity to pass upon them. If, as we think, the concluding words of paragraph 2 of section 7 are inapplicable then, as Congress has not adjourned, the bill, if not deemed to have been returned, will become a law despite the President's disapproval. Or, if that clause were deemed applicable and the return of the bill be considered to have been prevented by the recess, the bill would not become a law and Congress, although in session, would not be able to pass the bill over the President's objections.\n The extremely technical character of the argument which would make impossible the return of a bill because a House has taken a temporary recess is manifest. Suppose the President, who is clearly entitled to his ten days for consideration, sends the bill to the House in which it originated with his objections on the afternoon of the tenth day, but that House has adjourned at noon on that day until the following morning. Then, on the argument now advanced as to the construction of the concluding clause of paragraph 2 of section 7, the bill would not become a law and the objections of the President would operate practically as an absolute veto, although the Congress was in session and ready to consider his objections. Or if that result does not follow, in the view that the clause does not apply because Congress has not adjourned, then, if the bill is not regarded as returned, it becomes a law although the President has shown his disapproval within the ten days. These difficulties disappear if we dispense with wholly unnecessary technicalities as to the method of return and give effect to realities.\n We agree with the government that the precedents of executive action which have been cited are not persuasive. The question now raised has not been the subject of judicial decision and must be resolved not by past uncertainties, assumptions, or arguments, but by the applica- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 598]\n\u00a0\n tion of the controlling principles of constitutional interpretation.\n We are not impressed by the argument that while a recess of one House is limited to three days without the consent of the other House, cases may arise in which the other House consents to an adjournment and a long period of adjournment may result. We have no such case before us, and we are not called upon the conjecture as to the nature of the action which might be taken by the Congress in such a case, or what would be its effect.\n We hold that where the Congress has not adjourned and the House in which the bill originated is in recess for not more than three days under the constitutional permission while Congress is in session, the bill does not become a law if the President has delivered the bill with his objections to the appropriate officer of the House within the prescribed ten days, and the Congress does not pass the bill over his objections by the requisite votes. In this instance the bill was properly returned by the President, it was open to reconsideration in Congress, and it did not become a law.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO took no part in the decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting in part).\n I agree that the legislation now in question did not become a law, not, as the Court holds, because the bill vetoed by the President was returned to the Senate within the ten-day period or to any person authorized to receive the bill in its behalf, but because the Senate by its adjournment prevented the return and thus called into operation the provision that the bill 'shall not be a Law' where adjournment prevents its return to the House in \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 599]\n\u00a0\n which it originated within the ten days allowed to the President to sign or disapprove it. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The reasons assigned by the Court for its conclusion seem to me to have no application to the case now before us, and leave in confusion and doubt the meaning and effect of the veto provisions of the Constitution, the certainty of whose application is of supreme importance.\n Notwithstanding the cogently reasoned ruling of a unanimous court in The Pocket Veto Case, \n279 \nU.S. 655, 682\n, 49 S.Ct. 463, 467, 64 A.L.R. 1434, that the 'House' to which a bill is to be returned by the President means a House in session, we may assume for present purposes that each House of Congress, by appropriate action, may constitutionally confer upon its secretary, clerk, or some other officer, authority to receive a bill returned to it by the President. But it does not appear that any such authority has ever been conferred on the secretary of the Senate, or that he has hitherto assumed to act in that capacity. In The Pocket Veto Case this Court held that in 1926 it had not; and \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 600]\n\u00a0\n the Senate has since taken no step in that direction, perhaps because of our dictum in that case that such action would be unconstitutional.\n The Houses of Congress, being collective bodies, transacting their routine business by majority action, are capable of acting only when in session and by formal action recorded in their respective journals, or by recognition, through such action, of an established practice. Since the foundation of the government it has been the settled usage of both Houses of Congress to receive messages from the President and bills disapproved and returned by him, when in session. It does not appear that in the past the Secretary of the Senate or any other person has assumed to act for either House in receiving a bill returned by the President, and in one recorded instance the Secretary of the Senate and its President declined so to act. \n2\n There has been no action and no usage of either House recognizing the existence of such authority in any one. The Pocket Veto Case, Supra, \n279 \nU.S. 655\n, 682 et seq., 49 S.Ct. 463, 467, 64 A.L.R. 1434.\n The Secretary of the Senate is appointed by the body to serve at its pleasure, and his duties are prescribed by the Senate rules. They give no hint that among these duties is the important function of acting as the Senate in the receipt of bills returned to it by the President during the ten-day period, or retaining them in custody pending its reassembly when the return is during an adjournment. Not only have both Houses of Congress failed to designate any person to receive bills returned to them by \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 601]\n\u00a0\n the President, but in one instance they explicitly refused to take such action when it was proposed. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The conclusion seems inescapable that whatever constitutional power the Senate and House may possess to designate an officer to receive in their behalf bills returned by the President, they have not exercised it; the Constitution, which directs that bills shall be returned to the House in which they originate, has made no such designation, and neither the Constitution nor any statute, rule, or usage has indicated any person who could so act, or prescribed for any one duties embracing such a function.\n In such circumstances delivery of a bill to the Secretary of the Senate during its adjournment would seem to be no more a compliance with the constitutional requirement then would its deposit by the President's messenger with the sergeant at arms, a door-keeper, or any other person not clothed with authority or charged with official duty in the premises, who might be induced to receive the bill and undertake to bring it to the attention of the Senate upon reassembly. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Doubts as to the scope and effect of the rule now announced by the Court are multiplied by the intimation that a different rule may be applied in the case of adjourn- \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 602]\n\u00a0\n ment of either House of Congress, with the consent of the other, for more than three days, and that the present decision can, in some way not disclosed, be distinguished from our ruling in The Pocket Veto Case, where the return of a bill to the Senate was held to have been prevented by the adjournment of the Senate, pursuant to concurrent resolution, from July 3d to November 10th, the House having at the same time adjourned sine die. But such an intimation can rest on nothing more substantial than our unwillingness to face the obvious consequences of what is now decided. If it be said that an essential difference between the present case and The Pocket Veto Case lies in the fact that here the President delivered the bill with his veto message to the Secretary of the Senate, and that there he retained it without signing, then the rule which is now announced will, for all practical purposes, expire with its birth. We can hardly assume that a President would invite further congressional action by a return of a bill with his veto to a secretary or other officer of the House concerned, during its adjournment, if, by retention of the bill without signing, he could make the veto absolute.\n Again, if it be said that a distinction is to be drawn between adjournment of one House for three days and longer adjournments taken with the concurrence of the other House, no plausible reason can be advanced for saying that the Secretary or any other officer of the Senate possesses authority to receive returned bills during a three-day adjournment which he does not possess during a four-day or longer adjournment during a session of Congress. In The Pocket Veto Case the Senate adjourned during a session of Congress for four months, the House consenting. But the ten days allowed for consideration of the bill by the President expired the day after adjournment. If the decision in that case is to stand with this it can only be because the Secretary in the former lost on the day after \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 603]\n\u00a0\n adjournment an authority which he retained for a day after adjournment in the latter. If lost, it was either because the adjournment was for longer than three days and was thus one which could not be effected without a concurrent resolution, or because the other House had not remained in session. Such distinctions find as little support in Constitution, laws, and congressional practice, and in reason, as does the proposition that the Secretary of the Senate is, by virtue of his appointment as such, clothed with authority to receive in its behalf bills returned by the President.\n If in The Pocket Veto Case the Secretary of the Senate, where the bill originated, had authority after adjournment during the session, to receive it in behalf of the Senate, the adjournment did not prevent the return by the President, and the bill, upon his failure to sign or return it, became law by virtue of the constitutional provision just as did some 173 other bills which, until this moment, have been regarded as dead letters, as they were declared to be in The Pocket Veto Case, supra, \n279 \nU.S. 655, 691\n, 49 S.Ct. 463, 470, 64 A.L.R. 1434.5 If \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 604]\n\u00a0\n the Court was wrong on that point, its decision was wrong, and in the interests of a definite and precise constitutional procedure in a field where definiteness and precision are of paramount importance, it should now be frankly overruled.\n If I am wrong in my conclusion that the President did not in this case return the bill to the Senate by returning it to its Secretary during adjournment, then adjournment did not prevent its return, the President's veto became effective, and there is no occasion for the Court to indulge in an academic discussion of what may in other circumstances be the effect of an adjournment alone of the House in which a bill originates, which actually prevents such a return. The pronouncement now made that the President may be so deprived of the veto power ought to be avoided not only because, in my opinion, it is an erroneous interpretation of the Constitution which may have grave consequences, but because it is unnecessary to the decision. If the experience of one hundred and fifty years of constitutional interpretation has taught any lesson, it is the unwisdom of making solemn declarations as to the meaning of that instrument which are unnecessary to decision. They can serve no useful purpose, and their only effect may be to embarrass the Court when decision becomes necessary. O'Donoghue v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 516, 550\n, 53 S.Ct. 740, 750. Humphrey's Executor v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 602, 626\n, 627 S., 55 S.Ct. 869, 873. The declaration now made, for the first time, that the Constitution has left an undefined area in which the veto power cannot be \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 605]\n\u00a0\n exercised, is the more unfortunate since, in the circumstances, it seems almost certain that the Court will be called upon to reexamine it.\n If, on the other hand, I am right in my view that the President was here prevented from returning the bill, we are brought unavoidably to the decision of the question presented by the petition for certiorari and argued at the bar as the controlling question, whether the President is deprived of the veto power whenever return of a bill within the prescribed ten days is prevented by the adjournment alone of the House in which the bill originated.\n The framers, in seeking to establish and preserve the presidential veto, were aware that the originating House, unlike the President who is without incentive to avoid receipt of a bill which he is free to veto, might have the strongest motives to avoid the veto of a bill, if that were possible, by preventing its return or by challenging the fact of its return. They accordingly took care to provide for the return of a bill to the originating House by an act of public notoriety-its delivery to the House in session; and recognizing that return might be prevented by adjournment, they declared that in that case it should not become a law.\n The possibility that a return may be prevented by the adjournment of a single House during a session of Congress is not removed by deciding that a secretary or some other officer of the originating House may receive a returned bill during the period of a three-day adjournment. Either House may and does on occasion adjourn for longer periods, with the consent of the other. \n6\n An adjournment coincident with death or absence of the officer may prevent the return. Whatever authority in the premises the Senate or the House may give to its officer, it may \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 606]\n\u00a0\n withhold or withdraw. If the dictum now pronounced correctly states the fundamental law, the originating House may shorten the period for the exercise of the veto power or thwart it altogether by the simple expedient of adjournment after withdrawing the supposed authority of any officer to receive the vetoed bill.\n This Court has emphasized, as does the language of the Constitution, the great importance of the veto power and the dominating purpose expressed in the constitutional provision that the power shall not be curtailed or the ten days, allowed for its exercise, shortened. Edwards v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 482, 486\n, 493 S., 494, 52 S.Ct. 627, 628, 631; The Pocket Veto Case, supra, \n279 \nU.S. 655\n, at page 678, 49 S.Ct. 463, 466, 64 A.L.R. 1434. The words make it certain that the only adjournment which can prevent return of a bill by the President is that of the House in which the bill originates and to which, if vetoed, it is to be returned. Continuance in session of the other House does not facilitate return. No more can its adjournment obstruct return. Adjournment by the originating House can alone have the consequence to be guarded against, prevention of return. Hence, it was adjournment of the originating House with which the framers were concerned. There is no reason of which we are aware, and none has been suggested, for supposing that in creating and protecting the veto power they regarded the adjournment vel non of the nonoriginating house as of any consequence. or that they had any thought of leaving the President stripped of the veto power, either by chance or by design, whenever the originating House adjourned without the other. The men who created the framework of our government are not lightly to be charged with such an omission. The charge now made finds its only support in a punctilio of grammar.\n'We must never forget, that it is a constitution we are expounding.' McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407. Its provisions are not to be interpreted like those of a municipal code or of a penal statute, though \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 607]\n\u00a0\n even the latter is to be read so as not to defeat its obvious purpose, United States v. Raynor, \n302 \nU.S. 540\n, 58 S.Ct. 353, decided January 3, 1938, or lead to absurd consequences. United States v. Katz, \n271 \nU.S. 354, 362\n, 46 S.Ct. 513, 516. In defining their scope something more is involved than consultation of the dictionary and the rules of English grammar. They are to be read as a vital part of an organic whole so that the high purpose which illumines every sentence and phrase of the instrument may be given effect in a consistent and harmonious frame-work of government.\n\n The Court has hitherto consistently held that a literal reading of a provision of the Constitution which defeats a purpose evident when the instrument is read as a whole, is not to be favored. The phrase 'due process' in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments has long since been expended beyond its literal meaning of due procedure. See Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 \nU.S. 97\n; cf. Brandeis, J., concurring in Whitney v. California, \n274 \nU.S. 357, 373\n, 47 S.Ct. 641, 647. The term 'contract' in the contract clause is not confined literally to the contracts of the law dictionary. Dartmouth College v. Wood-ward, 4 Wheat. 518. The prohibition against their impairment has never been taken to be inexorable. Home Building & Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398\n, and cases cited at 430, 54 S.Ct. 231, 237, 88 A.L.R. 1481 et seq. The injunction that no person 'shall be compelled in any Criminal Case to be a witness against himself' is not literally applied. Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591, 595\n, 16 S.Ct. 644. 'From whatever source derived,' as it is written in the Sixteenth Amendment, does not mean from whatever source derived. Evans v. Gore, \n253 \nU.S. 245\n, 40 S.Ct. 550, 11 A.L.R. 519. See, also, Robertson v. Baldwin, \n165 \nU.S. 275, 281\n, 282 S., 17 S.Ct. 326; Gompers v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 604, 610\n, 34 S.Ct. 693, Ann.Cas.1915D, 1044; Bain Peanut Co. v. Pinson, \n282 \nU.S. 499, 501\n, 51 S.Ct. 228, 229; United States v. Lefkowitz, \n285 \nU.S. 452, 467\n, 52 S.Ct. 420, 424, 82 A.L.R. 775.\n But here, regardless of the constitutional purpose and the larger considerations which have usually guided our interpretation of the Constitution as an instrument of \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 608]\n\u00a0\n government, it is insisted that the phrase 'unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return' cannot be taken to include the adjournment alone of the single House whose adjournment is in every case the only effective means of preventing a return. It is said that the word 'Congress,' used to describe the body whose adjournment occasions the pocket veto, followed as it is by the plural possessive pronoun 'their,' can refer only to the two Houses comprised in 'the Congress,' and hence cannot refer to adjournment of a single House. This subordination of the framers' main objective to a meticulously grammatical interpretation of their words is unwarranted. It would hardly be suggested that the command, 'Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy,' article 1,  5, cl. 3, calls for the concurrence of the judgment of all the members of a House in order to ban publication of a journal: 'their Judgment' is obviously that of the controlling part of the membership; that part whose opinion, under applicable rules of congressional procedure, is decisive of the question. A similar analysis based on the purpose and context of the clause now before us demands recognition that the draftsmen were concerned with the adjournment only of that part of the Congress to which return was to be made and whose absence would thus prevent return of a bill by the President. In the light of these dominant facts it seems plain that in using the words 'their Adjournment' the framers referred to any action taken by the members of Congress of either House or both Houses, which was effective to prevent return of a bill by the President to the originating House. The very force of the circumstances to which the words are applied gives emphasis to 'Adjournment' as that which prevents return, and to 'their' as referring to the action of those members of Congress which effects \n\n[302 \nU.S. 583, 609]\n\u00a0\n the adjournment. This usage parallels that in the clause requiring the publication of the journals of both Houses 'excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy.' In both instances the significant action, adjournment, or the exercise of judgment as the case may be, is that of those members whose action is effective to accomplish the contemplated result; there, prohibition of publication; here, prevention of return to the originating House. Thus read, no word is without appropriate meaning and the clause is consistent both with the obvious purpose and with the grammatical usage appearing elsewhere in the Constitution.\n I cannot ignore that purpose and say that for no discernible reason other than our present-day notions of grammatical construction we are compelled to read the words as excluding from the operation of the clauses designed to protect the veto power, every case where the return of a bill is prevented by adjournment of a single House.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This communication was as follows:\n'United States Senate,\n\n'Washington, May 7, 1936.\n\n'Hon. John N. Garner,\n\n'President of the Senate.\n\n'My dear Mr. President:\n\n'On Friday, April 24, 1936, the Committee on Enrolled Bills of the Senate presented to the President of the United States the enrolled bills ( S. 713) granting jurisdiction of the Court of Claims to hear the case of David A. Wright, and (S. 929) for the relief of the Southern Products Co., which had passed both Houses of Congress and been signed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate.\n\n'The Senate, at 3:25 p.m. Monday, May 4, 1936, took a recess until 12 noon on Thursday, May 7, 1936.\n\n'During the interim the President of the United States sent by messenger two messages addressed to the Senate, each dated May 5, 1936, giving his reasons for not approving, respectively, Senate bill 713 and Senate bill 929. The Senate not being in session on the last day which the President had for the return of these bills under the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, in order to protect the interests of the Senate, so that it might have the opportunity to reconsider the bills, I accepted the messages, and I now present to you the President's veto messages, with the accompanying papers, for disposition by the Senate.\n\n'Sincerely yours, Edwin A. Halsey,\n\n Secretary of the Senate.' \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Article 1,  7, cl. 2, of the Constitution reads as follows: 'Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by Yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] On May 19, 1888, President Cleveland attempted to return a bill to the Senate during an adjournment, by tendering it to the Secretary and to the President of the Senate. Both officers rejected the tender, 'claiming that the return of said bill and the delivery of said message could only properly be made to the Senate when in actual session.' President Cleveland's message, Senate Journal, 50th Cong., 1st Sess. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In 1868 a bill reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee and passed by majority vote of the Senate, provided for a return of a bill to a House not sitting by delivery of it at the office of the Secretary of the Senate or of the Clerk of the House, as the case might be. Strong opposition to the bill developed in Senate debate, the bill was not reported out of the Judiciary Committee of the House, and failed of passage. The Pocket Veto Case, supra, \n279 \nU.S. 686\n et seq., 49 S.Ct. 468. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The fact that the Senate has taken pains to confer express authority in some instances, by formal resolution, Gilfry, Precedents, 226, 462, by rule, Senate Manual, 1936, 5, 8, 12, 36, or by standing order, id, at 128 et seq., persuades that the important power to receive a bill would not be conferred sub silentio. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] A memorandum prepared in the office of the Attorney General and transmitted by the President to Congress in 1927, H.Doc. No. 493, 70th Cong., 2d Sess., cites more than 400 bills and resolutions which were passed by Congress and submitted to the President less than ten days before final or interim adjournment of Congress, which were not signed by the President or returned with his disapproval. Of these, 119 were instances in which the adjournment was for a session of Congress as distinguished from its final adjournment. None of these bills or resolutions were placed upon the statute books or treated as having become a law. No attempt appears to have been made to enforce them in the courts, except the law involved in The Pocket Veto Case. It does not appear that in any of these instances either House of Congress has taken any official action indicating that in its judgment any of these bills became laws. See The Pocket Veto Case, supra, \n279 \nU.S. 655, 690\n, 691 S., 49 S.Ct. 463, 470, 64 A.L.R. 1434. Examination of the House Calendars shows that in the period since that covered by the Attorney General's memorandum, 54 bills have been pocketed before the end of a Congress with no attempt to return them. This was done twice in the Seventy-First Congress, once in the Seventy-Second Congress, twenty-eight times in the Seventy-Fourth Congress, and twenty-three times in the First Session of the Seventy-Fifth Congress.

KIDWELL(1938)\nNo. 782\nArgued: Decided: May 16, 1938\n\n\n\n\n\n[304 \nU.S. 359, 360]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Bates Booth, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. Frank Kemp, of Atlanta, Ga., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondents were paroled before completing sentences in federal prisons. \n1\n Before expiration of their sentences and while on parole, they committed second federal offenses, for which they were convicted, sentenced, and thereafter completely served sentences in the Atlanta Penitentiary. Respondents contend that from the moment of their imprisonment in the penitentiary under the second sentences, they also began service of the unexpired part of their original sentences. If this contention is correct, respondents have also completely served the unexpired parts of the first sentences.\n Petitioner contends, however, that when respondents violated their paroles by committing the second federal crimes, they were no longer in custody under the first sentences; service of the first sentences was interrupted and suspended and was not resumed before completon of service of the second sentences; and that, after completion of the second sentences, the Board of Parole has authority to require completion of the first sentences, service of which ceased due to the interruption by parole violations. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 359, 361]\n\u00a0\n After completion of service of the second sentences, respondents were held in custody by the warden of the penitentiary under warrants of a member of the Board of Parole alleging violations of parole. The District Court, believing the first sentences 'began to run again the moment ... ( respondents were) received at the Penitentiary,' discharged respondents from custody on habeas corpus proceedings. \n2\n The Court of Appeals affirmed. 3 Due to the importance of the question involved, we granted certiorari. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n When respondent committed a federal crime while on parole, for which he was arrested, convicted, sentenced, and imprisoned, not only was his parole violated, but service of his original sentence was interrupted and suspended. Thereafter, his imprisonment was attributable to his second sentence only, and his rights and status as to his first sentence were 'analogous to those of an escaped convict.' \n5\n Not only had he-by his own conduct-forfeited the privileges granted him by parole, but, since he was no longer in either actual or constructive custody under his first sentence, service under the second sentence cannot be credited to the first without doing violence to the plain intent and purpose of the statutes providing for a parole system.\n The Parole Board and its members have been granted sole authority to issue a warrant for the arrest and return to custody of a prisoner who violates his parole. \n6\n A member of the Board ordered that respondent be taken into custody after completion of the second sentence. \n\n[304 \nU.S. 359, 362]\n\u00a0\n Until completion of the second sentence-and before the warrant was served- respondent was imprisoned only by virtue of the second sentence. There is, therefore, no question as to concurrent service of sentences, unless-as respondent contends-section 723c7 required that the unexpired part of respondent's first sentence begins when he was imprisoned under the second sentence. That section provides:\n'... The Board of Parole ... or any member thereof, shall have the exclusive authority to issue warrants for the retaking of any United States prisoner who has violated his parole. The unexpired term of imprisonment of any such prisoner shall begin to run from the date he is returned to the institution, and the time the prisoner was on parole shall not diminish the time he was originally sentenced to serve.'\n\n Obviously, this provision does not require that a parole violator's original, unexpired sentence shall begin to run from the date he is imprisoned for a new and separate offense. It can only refer to reimprisonment on the original sentence under order of the Parole Board.\n Since service of the original sentence was interrupted by parole violation, the full term of that sentence has not been completed. Just as respondent's own misconduct (parole violation) has prevented completion of the original sentence, so has it continued the authority of the boar o ver respondent until that sentence is completed and expires. Discretionary authority in the board to revoke a parole at any time before expiration of a parolee's sentence was provided-and is necessary-as a means of insuring the public that parole violators would be punished. \n8\n The proper working of the parole system re- \n\n[304 \nU.S. 359, 363]\n\u00a0\n quires that the board have authority to discipline, guide and control parole violators whose sentences have not been completed. It is not reasonable to assume that Congress intended that a parolee whose conduct measures up to parole standards should remain under control of the board until expiration of the term of his sentence, but that misconduct of a parole violator could result in reducing the time during which the board has control over him to a period less than his original sentence.\n Parole is intended to be a means of restoring offenders who are good social risks to society; to afford the unfortunate another opportunity by clemency-under guidance and control of the Board. \n9\n Unless a parole violator can be required to serve some time in prison in addition to that imposed for an offence committed while on parole, he not only escapes punishment for the unexpired portion of his original sentence, but the disciplinary power of the Board will be practically nullified. If the parole laws should be construed as respondent contends, parole might be more reluctantly granted, contrary to the broad humane purpose of Congress to grant relief from imprisonment to deserving prisoners. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Respondents have not completed service of their original sentences and were not entitled to release. The causes \n\n[304 \nU.S. 359, 364]\n\u00a0\n are reversed and remanded to the District Court for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO and Mr. Justice REED, took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Some were released with credit for good conduct but are treated as on parole until their maximum terms have expired. 18 U.S.C. c. 22,  716b, 18 U.S.C.A.  716b. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 19 F.Supp. 475.
