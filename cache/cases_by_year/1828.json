CO. v. 356 BALES OF COTTON(1828)\n\nArgued: Decided: January 1, 1828\n\n\n\n\n[26 U.S. 511, 513]\n\u00a0\n APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States, for the District of South Carolina.\n The libel filed in this cause in the District Court of South Carolina, on the 18th April, 1825, alleged that five hundred and eighty-four bales of cotton insured by the libellants, were shipped on board the ship Point a Petre, on a voyage from New-Orleans to Havre de Grace in France, and was in February, 1825, wrecked on the coast of Florida; from which it was saved, and carried into Key West, in the territory of Florida, where it was sold, without any previous adjudication by a Court of competent jurisdiction, for the ostensible purpose of satisfying a claim for salvage, amounting to seventy-six per cent. of the property saved. That the cotton thus insured, was abandoned to the underwriters, the libellants, and the abandonment was accepted by them on the 10th March, 1825.-That part of the cargo, amounting to one hundred and forty bales, subsequently arrived in the port of New-York, and was there proceeded against by the libellants, as their property under the abandonment. That another part of the cargo, amounting to between three hundred and three hundred and fifty-six bales, had arrived in the port of Charleston, within the jurisdiction of the Court, in the possession of one David Canter, and was fraudulently sold in Charleston, at auction, on the 13th of April, 1825. Restitution of this last mentioned part was therefore prayed by the libellants, and process was issued against the said Canter in personam.\n The marshal returned to the warrant that he had taken one hundred and sixty bales of cotton, and the person of Canter. Fifty-four bales of the cotton, specifically brought into Court, were ordered to be sold and the proceeds paid into the Registry; and the supposed value of the remainder in dispute, to be secured by stipulation.\n David Canter filed his answer claiming three hundred and fifty-six bales of cotton, as a bona fide purchaser, under a sale at public auction at Key West, by virtue of the decree of a certain Court, consisting of a Notary and five Jurors, proceeding under an Act of the Governor and Legislative Council of Florida, passed the 4th of July, 1823, which decree awarded to the salvors seventy-six per cent. on the nett proceeds of sale.\n The testimony of witnesses was taken, and other evidence produced, relating to the title of the libellants under the insurances and abandonments thereon, and to the proceedings in the Court at Key West.\n The District Judge pronounced the proceedings in the Court at Key West a nullity; but decreed restitution to the libellants of thirty-nine bales of the cotton only, (deducting a salvage of \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 514]\n\u00a0\n fifty per cent.;) considering the evidence of the identity of the residue, as insufficient to establish their proprietary interest.\n The libellants and claimant both appealed from this decree to the Circuit Court.\n Further testimony was taken in the Circuit Court; and at the hearing, the decree of the District Court was reversed, and the entire cotton decreed to the claimant with costs; upon the ground that the proceedings of the Court at Key West were legal, and transferred the property to the alleged purchaser under them.\n From this decree the libellants appealed to this Court.\n The documents exhibited and evidence taken in the case, showed that three hundred and thirty-three bales of the cotton, on board the Point a Petre, were insured by the American, and three hundred and fifty-one by the Ocean office. The whole cargo of the ship consisted of eight hundred and ninety-one bales, but to whom the other three hundred and seventeen bales belonged, did not appear. The ship sailed on the voyage insured on the 17th February 1825, and was wrecked on Carysforth Reef, on the east coast of West Florida, about eight miles from the shore. She filled with water, and was abandoned by the captain and crew.\n In the depositions taken in the cause, it was stated, that when the vessel was first seen, she was filled with water, abandoned, bilged, and lying on her broad side. The cotton was taken out of her, hove into the sea, rafts made of it, towed inside of the reef, and then put on board of vessels. The captain of the ship was picked up on the shore with his men, about fourteen miles from the wreck, and he went with the salvors to Key West, where the property saved was carried; and the proceedings for salvage were at Key West, carried on, as was alleged, with the co- operation and concurrence of the master of the ship.\n The danger in saving the property was said to have been very great, the weather to have been stormy, some of the men were injured, and the saving was done during the night as well as the day; most of the cotton was much injured.\n After the sale, the agent of the appellants, Mr. Ogden, came on from New York to Key West, for the purpose of attending the sale, and he expressed his willingness to pay to the purchasers of the cotton, a considerable sum, beyond what had been paid for it at the sale.\n It was also in evidence, that the marks on the cotton were defaced, and that the efforts to ascertain the particular marks on that imported into Charleston by the appellee, were, to a great extent, without success. A large portion of the cotton brought to Charleston by the claimant, was sold at auction as \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 515]\n\u00a0\n damaged cotton. An agreement between the two insurance companies, the appellants, was made previous to the institution of the suit, that the same should be for their joint benefit. David Canter, the appellee, claimed three hundred and fifty-six bales of the cotton, as a bona fide purchaser under the decree of the Court of Key West, instituted by, and proceeding under a law of the Legislative Council of Florida, passed 4th July 1823; which decree awarded seventy-six per cent. to the salvors, of the net proceeds of the sale.\n The appellants filed the following 'reasons of appeal.'\n That the decision of the Circuit Court is erroneous, inasmuch as the said tribunal at Key West was not legally organized, nor of competent jurisdiction in the premises.\n 1st. Because the Constitution and laws of the United States are of full force and effect within the territory of Florida.\n 2d. Because jurisdiction of salvage was not a rightful subject of legislation, with the Floridian government; and the wrecking law enacted by the same, is, in various respects, inconsistent with the said Constitution and laws.\n 3d. Because the Superior Courts of the said territory are vested with plenary and exclusive jurisdiction over all admiralty and maritime cases; and this was a case of that description.\n 4th. Because, even if the jurisdiction of the said Courts were confined to 'cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States,'-this was a case of that class.\n 5th. Because the said Superior Courts were vested with original cognizance in all cases, where the amount in issue exceeded the value of one hundred dollars. \n*\n\u00a0\n\n * The Reporter acknowledges with pleasure, his obligations to Mr. Justice Johnson, by whom he has been furnished with a copy of the opinion delivered by him on the decision of this case.\n Mr. Justice JOHNSON.-This case comes up on a cross appeal, from a decision of the District Court, adjudging a part of the res subjecta to the libellants, and the residue to the claimants.\n The decree establishes the right of the parties libellant to recover, but dismisses the libel as to a great proportion of the cotton, on the ground of a defect of evidence to identify it.\n From the pleadings and testimony, it appears that the libellants were insurers to a large amount on a quantity of cotton shipped by certain individuals, in the French ship Point a Petre, on a voyage from Orleans to Havre. That the ship was stranded and lost on the coast of Florida, and the cotton abandoned to these underwriters. That the cotton libelled, was a part of the cargo of the Point a Petre, is admitted; \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 516]\n\u00a0\n David Canter claimed all the cotton except thirty-nine bales on the ground:- \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 517]\n\u00a0\n First, That he was in the possession of it, not tortiously, but as a bona fide purchaser, and that that possession, thus acquired, \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 518]\n\u00a0\n is good against all but the person who proves a better title to this identical cotton.\n[518-Continued] \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 519]\n\u00a0\n Second.-That the salvors had a rightful lien upon the cargo saved; that the captain of the Point a Petre was agent for the \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 520]\n\u00a0\n underwriters, and had authority to settle the amount of that claim, either by agreement, or an award of third persons; that \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 521]\n\u00a0\n he applied to these third persons, and agreed to their proceedings, and to the sale; that the sale was afterwards ratified by Ogden, the special agent of the underwriters. \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 522]\n\u00a0\n Third.-He claims the whole three hundred and fifty-six bales, on the ground of a sale by a Court of the territory of Florida.\n[522-Continued]\n___ With regard to the second, I have no doubt but that the individual who chooses to resort to his common law remedy, of an action for work and labour, instead of libelling for salvage, may maintain an original suit in the Superior Court of the territory. But I see nothing in the Act which makes that jurisdiction exclusive, in a case in which both remendies are open to the choice of the party. The language of the 6th section is, 'That the judicial power shall be vested in two Superior Courts, and in such inferior Courts, and justices of the peace as the legislative council of the territory may from time to time establish.' The 7th section of this Act, and the 2d of the subsequent Act, confine to the Superior Courts exclusively, the jurisdiction over the cases arising under the laws, &c. of the United States, of which the Kentucky Court had jurisdiction-but as to all others, I perceive nothing in the law which precluded the Florida legislature, from making any distribution of jurisdiction consistent with preserving to the Superior Court a concurrent jurisdiction, to be exercised according to its own terms.\n It is proper to remark here, that whatever may be the fact as to the integrity and propriety, which regulate the proceedings of the Court at Key West, there is nothing novel or unprecedented in the organization of that Court. The model of it is of great antiquity, and throughout the civilized world, some such summary mode of adjusting salvage, in cases of wreck of the sea, is to be found. We had just such a Court here, and I believe in most of the states, when the Constitution was adopted; and although jurisdiction of the subject has been every where abandoned to the District Courts of the United States, where it is generally adjusted with great solemnity and discretion, and I believe, very much to the satisfaction of all the commercial world, there exists no reason to preclude the Congress of the United States from constituting similar summary tribunals, whenever and wherever it may become necessary. The establishment of this tribunal, therefore, however justice may be distributed in it, is no unwarrantable exercise of the legislative or judicial power vested in Florida.\n Finally, I am of opinion that there is error in the decision of the District Court, and adjudge that it be reversed, and the goods restored to the claimant with costs.\n H. N. Cruger, for libellants, King and Gadsden, for claimant. \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 523]\n\u00a0\n Fourth.-That was a foreign Court, acting under a municipal law, and having the property within its reach; its jurisdiction cannot be inquired into. Fifth.-If the jurisdiction of that Court can be inquired into, they contend that jurisdiction was conferred upon it: Sixth.-With the 8th section of the Act of Congress of the 3d March 1823, which is in these words: 'That each of the said Superior Courts shall moreover have and exercise the same jurisdiction within its limits, in all cases arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States, which by an Act to establish the Judicial Courts of the United States, approved the 27th September 1789, and an Act in addition to said Act, approved the 2d of March 1793, was vested in the Court of Kentucky District.'\n The case was argued by Mr. Ogden for the appellants, and by Mr. Whipple and Mr. Webster for the claimants:\n Mr. Ogden-- The great question in this case is the validity of the proceedings of the territorial Court; and upon the threshold of this inquiry it is asked, how far it is competent for this Court to examine the constitutionality of the Court at Key West, and the legality of its proceedings.\n The libel filed in the District Court, sought the restoration of the cotton, subject to a reasonable salvage. The claimant asserts his right to it under a sale, and the inquiry is, whether the property was changed by the proceedings directing the sale. The decision upon this inquiry, rests upon the right of the Court to take jurisdiction of the subject matter.\n The common law rule is, that when a Court acts within its powers, its acts are binding on all the world; but if beyond them, they are entirely void. It is therefore necessary to look into the constitution of the Court. Abbot on Ship. 11 ed. 16 n. Starkie 215. 9 Mass. 462. 3 Wheat. 234. The next inquiry is into the nature of the case, of which the Court took cognizance; and then, whether it was within its jurisdiction?\n It was a case of salvage, and salvage is of admiralty jurisdiction. 1 Wheat. 335-Sergeant's Constitutional Law, 206.-In England there was a great contest upon this question, but it was finally settled in favour of the jurisdiction of the admiralty, by the statute of Rich. 3d. Abbot on Ship. 433. It is now to be inquired, could the Court at Key West, lawfully exercise admiralty jurisdiction? The Constitution was made for the whole people of the United States, without reference to their being within the original thirteen states.-The 3d article 2d section defines, 'the judicial powers,' and declares 'it shall extend to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.'- \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 524]\n\u00a0\n The treaty with Great Britain of 1783, ceded a large tract of country to the United States, a great portion of which, if not the whole, was within the limits of the thirteen states, and was claimed by several of the states, but was afterwards ceded to the United States. Thus the United States became possessed of all these territories by cession, all of which, except that ceded by Georgia, having been acquired under the confederation, the people upon those territories became citizens of the United States by those cessions, and were entitled to all the rights and privileges of citizens.\n In the articles of confederation, there is no provision for acquiring rights to lands; but on the contrary, the lands within the territories of the several states, were considered as belonging to those states. By what authority did the confederation acquire a right to the lands ceded to them? Whence then, did the confederation draw the capacity to take and hold those lands? Not from any municipal regulations, or from the laws of the states; or from the express terms of the articles of confederation; but from the great principles of public law. The powers of Congress were to make war, and peace, and to make treaties; and in those and the other powers, were included those under which territories were acquired and governed.\n That Congress considered themselves possessed of those powers is shown by the resolutions of 6th September 1780, and 10th October 1780, recommending to the states to cede their unappropriated lands-and also by the ordinance for the government of the territory north-west of the river Ohio, passed 13th July 1787. That the inhabitants of the territories thus acquired, were citizens of the United States, is manifest from the fact, that as soon as they were sufficiently numerous to protect themselves, and to form a state government, they became a part of the Union. The territories to which these observations apply, were not part of the nation at the time of the establishment of the Constitution.\n The Circuit Court in delivering their opinion, draw a distinction between territories so situated, and those which were afterwards acquired. Is there any foundation for this distinction?\n The rights of the United States to hold territories, not a part of the nation at the time of the confederation, in the same manner as the right to all those within the original thirteen states, is derived from the same universal principles of general law; from the powers of making peace, and war, and of making treaties, &c. It is necessary for the peace of he Union, that they should possess those powers.\n In what relation then do, the inhabitants of an acquired territory, \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 525]\n\u00a0\n stand to the United States? Are they citizens, or subjects? This is a grave question, and merits the serious consideration of the Court.\n The first territory acquired by the United States, was Louisiana; and by the third article of the treaty, as well as by subsequent legislative Acts, the inhabitants of the country became entiled to the privileges of citizens. The acquiescence of the people of the United States, fully establishes, that the powers exercised in reference to Louisiana, were properly exercised.\n The third section, fourth article, of the Constitution, authorizes the admission of new states into the Union. This section of the Constitution, gives to Congress a power, only limited by their own discretion, to admit as many states as they may think proper, in what manner soever the territory composing those new states may have been acquired.\n After the acquisition of Louisiana, Congress considered and treated the people of the country in the same manner they considered the inhabitants of every other territory of the United States,-as a part of the nation at the time of the confederation. The various legislative Acts in reference to Louisiana, establish this position.\n The next great acquisition of the United States by cession from a foreign government, was that of Florida from Spain. The sixth article of the treaty declares, 'The inhabitants of the territories which his Catholic Majesty cedes to the United States by this treaty, shall be incorporated into the Union of the United States, as soon as may be consistent with the principles of the Federal Constitution, and admitted to the enjoyment of all the privileges, rights and immunities of citizens of the United States.'\n The provisions of this article, in all respects similar to that on the Louisiana treaty, stipulating for the privileges of the inhabitants of the country, authorize the belief that the government of the United States doubted their power under the Constitution to receive a cession upon any other terms, than that the people inhabiting the country should be citizens of the United States. The Act of Congress entitled 'an Act for the establishment of a territorial government in Florida,' followed this treaty, and was passed 20th March 1802.\n The fifth section of this Act constitutes a legislative body for the territory, and declares that their legislative powers, shall extend to all the rightful subjects of legislation; but no law shall be valid, which is inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States. The sixth section establishes the judicial power, and appoints a superior Court, and gives the territorial \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 526]\n\u00a0\n legislature power to establish inferior Courts. The seventh section prescribes the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, and declares that the said Superior Court shall have and exercise the same jurisdiction within its limits in all cases arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States, which was vested in the Court of the Kentucky district, by the Judiciary Act of 1789; and the Act in addition thereto, of 2d March 1793; and writs of error and appeal from the decision in the said Superior Court, authorized by this section of the Act, shall be made to the Supreme Court of the United States in the same cases, and under the same regulations, as from the Circuit Court of the United States. By the eighth section, the Judges of the Superior Courts and other officers, are to be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; and all the Judges are to take an oath to support the Constitution of the United States, before they enter on the duties of their office; and the salaries of the Governor, Judges, &c. are to be paid out of the treasury of the United States.\n The 9th section declares, that certain Acts of Congress which are enumerated in the section, 'and all other public laws of the United States, which are not repugnant to the provisions of this Act; shall extend to, and have full force and effect, in the territory aforesaid.'\n The 14th section provides for the appointment of one delegate to Congress, for the territory.\n The Circuit Court, in their opinion in this case say, 'they have the most explicit proof, that the understanding of the public functionaries, is, that the government of the United States does not extend to such territories, by the mere act of cession. For in the Act of Congress, of March 1822, section 9th, we have an enumeration of the Acts of Congress, which are to be held in force in the territory; and, in the 10th section, an enumeration in the nature of a bill of rights of privileges, and which could not be denied to the inhabitants of the territory, if the came under the Constitution, by the mere act of cession.'\n An examination of the Act, will show that it does not warrant this construction. The 5th section declares no law shall be passed by the territorial legislature, which is inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States. This shows that Congress did consider the Constitution and laws as extending there. Why prohibit the passage of a law inconsistent with them, if they had no operation there?\n The 7th section gives the Supreme Court jurisdiction in all cases, under the laws and Constitution of the United States. Those laws must therefore have been considered to extend \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 527]\n\u00a0\n there, or why empower their enforcement by the Supreme Court?\n The 8th section provides for the appointment of the officers of the government, including the Judges of the Supreme Court, by the President, by and with the advice of the Senate. This manifests the admission that the Constitution extends there; as by the Constitution this mode of appointment is established.\n The law also provides, that the officers of the territory, appointed according to its purposes, shall take an oath to support the Constitution of the United States. Why take this oath, if that Constitution does not extend to the territory? The payment of the officers of the territory, out of the Treasury of the United States, which could not be constitutionally authorized by Congress, unless the Constitution operated there, may also be referred to, as evidence of the principles contended for by the appellants.\n Because Congress have enumerated certain laws as extending to the territory, in the 9th section of the Act, it is inferred, that Congress desired none other should extend there, and that, without such enactment, none would have been in operation there.\n The language of the section disaffirms this position. After enumerating certain Acts, it closes with a provision 'That all the other public laws of the United States, which are not repugnant to the provisions of this Act, shall extend to, and have full force in the territory.' By the enumeration of 'some laws,' it is therefore evident that Congress did not mean to exclude those not enumerated. But it is said, the 10th section contains an enumeration in the nature of a bill of rights, of privileges, which, if the Constitution extended there, could not be denied. This is not admitted. The introduction of this provision, was necessary, for the purpose of controlling the powers granted by the local legislature, and to secure to the inhabitants rights which they had under the Constitution, but which might have been otherwise infringed, unless provisions were made to carry the principles of the Constitution into effect.\n It has been shown: 1st. That the people in the territories of the United States are citizens of the United States, entitled to all the benefits derived from the laws and Constitution of the United States, and subject to all the provisions of the Constitution, and the laws passed under it.\n\n 2. \nThat in principle, there can be no difference between a territory formed out of a country, within the old limits of the United States, and a territory in newly acquired country.\n\n 3. \nAnd that, therefore, the people of Florida, immediately \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 528]\n\u00a0\n upon its cession, or at any rate upon the passing of the Act instituting the territorial government, became citizens of the United States, to whom the laws and Constitution extended.\n The inquiry now is, whether in establishing the Court or tribunal by which the cotton claimed in this case was ordered to be sold, the legislature of Florida have not violated the Constitution of the United States, and the laws of Congress passed under it. If they have, then the Court is an illegal Court, and all its acts are void.\n It is not only upon general principles, that the act of establishing the Court is invalid, but also by the provision of the Act of Congress, which prohibits the passing any law, inconsistent with the laws and Constitution of the United States.\n In the article of the Constitution relative to the judicial power of the government, it is declared, that it shall extend to all cases of admiralty and nartime jurisdiction. It has been shown, that the provision applies to territories as well as states; the Cosntitution being necessarily paramount within the limits of the United States. The Constitution having vested the judicial power in a Supreme Court, and such inferior Courts as Congress may from time to time establish, the legislative power under this provision has been exercised by the Acts of March 1822 and 1823. Superior Courts have been erected, to which, in addition to the powers of territorial Courts, jurisdiction is assigned within its limits in all cases arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States, which, by the Judicial Acts of the United States, was vested in the Court of Kentucky district, with a right of appeal, and a writ of error to this Court.\n By the same Acts, authority is given to the territorial legislature, to establish inferior Courts strictly territorial, and the jurisdiction of which, extends to subjects not within the cognizance of the tribunals of the Union.\n What are the powers, of the Court of the Kentucky district? Among other subjects of jurisdiction in the District Court of the United States, it is declared, by the ninth section of the Judiciary Act of 1799, 'that they shall have exclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, including all seizures under the laws of import, navigation and trade of the United States, where the seizures are made on waters which are navigable from the sea by vessels of ten or more tons burthen.' Thus the Kentucky district had exclusive cognizance of cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and consequently, it has exclusive control over cases of salvage.\n The tenth section provides, that the District Court of Kentucky shall, besides the jurisdiction aforesaid, have jurisdiction \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 529]\n\u00a0\n of all other causes, except of appeals made cognizable in a Circuit Court, & c.\n It follows from the provisions of the Act relative to the territorial government, and its reference for the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, to that existing in the Court of the Kentucky district, that in the Superior Court of Florida, there is exclusively jurisdiction over admiralty and maritime causes, and of course, of the claims of the salvors of the cotton, comprising part of the cargo of the Point a Petre. The jurisdiction is exclusive, for it could not be given to the territorial Courts by an Act of the territorial legislature, they not having the power to give it; the laws of the United States, having vested it in the Supreme Court, having similar powers to the District Court of Kentucky, and the powers of the territorial Court being limited within the observance of the provisions of the laws of the United States.\n Independent of the restriction imposed upon the territorial legislature, by which they were disabled from giving admiralty and maritime jurisdiction to the inferior Courts of Florida, the Constitution of the United States would have been violated by such legislation. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land; and, if without a prohibition in the territorial law, the legislative authority of Florida could not 'coin money' or 'issue bills of credit,' the establishing of a Court with admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, would be equally repugnant to the Constitution; such jurisdiction being exclusively, by the Constitution, in Courts established by Congress.\n It is said in the opinion of the Circuit Court, that the jurisdiction in cases of salvage, is not vested by Congress in the Superior Courts of Florida. A reference to the laws establishing the Court of the district of Kentucky, and to the Act relative to Florida, authorizes a different position. Jurisdiction is given by those laws, 'in cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.' What is such a case? Is not the extent of the judicial power of the Courts of the United States, a question arising under the Constitution? The Constitution having declared, that the judicial power shall extend to cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, is not a case of admiralty jurisdiction a question of this character? A prohibition in a state Court in a case of admiralty jurisdiction, and a plea interposed, that exclusive cognizance of admiralty cases is in the Courts of the United States, would at once raise a question under the Constitution. The principle seems to be, that whenever a case arises, in which the question is as to the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States, it is necessarily and always a question arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 530]\n\u00a0\n A case of salvage does not, strictly speaking, arise under the laws and Constitution of the United States, as the right to salvage depends on the principles of maritime law; but the amount of salvage, depends on the decision of a Court, guided by the circumstances of the case, and exercising admiralty and mari time jurisdiction. Thus, as the jurisdiction over the case is given by the Constitution, the decision upon it, becomes a case arising under the Constitution.\n Whether a man is bound to pay a promissory note is not a question of this description, and yet in cases of promissory notes held by the Bank of the United States, this Court have always decided that the Courts of the United States have jurisdiction; because all actions brought by the bank, are cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. Congress could give this Court jurisdiction of such cases, on no other principle.\n If then, under a clause in the Constitution extending the judicial power of the United States to all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, this Court will sustain jurisdiction upon a promissory note, with the making of which, and the extent of the liability of the parties thereto, the Constitution and laws of the United States have nothing to do.-If those liabilities are questions arising under a different law, and the jurisdiction is sustained by the Court, only in the particular case of the Bank of the United States, as a case arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States; why is a different rule to apply in a case of salvage, of which the exclusive jurisdiction is given by the Constitution and law of the United States to the District Court? Is not the one as much a case arising under the laws of the United States, as the other?\n Upon the whole, it is contended, that the Superior Courts of Florida, having the same jurisdiction in cases arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States, as the District Court of Kentucky had, under the Acts of Congress; and as the District Court of Kentucky has exclusive jurisdiction in all civil cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; that, therefore, the Superior Courts in Florida have exclusive jurisdiction in all civil, admiralty and maritime cases-that salvage is a case of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction-and that, therefore, any law of Florida, giving jurisdiction in a case of salvage to any other Court is unconstitutional; and all the acts of the Court under it, are void.\n Mr. Whipple and Mr. Webster for the claimant. Mr. Whipple contended:-- 1. That Canter was a purchaser at Key West of the property in question, which was sold by the consent of the owners.\n After the disaster and abandonment, the captain of the Point \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 531]\n\u00a0\n a Petre, acted as agent to the underwriters. When the cotton arrived at Key West, the salvors and the captain were owners of it as tenants in common. The captain had a legal right to sell the proportion that belonged to the underwriters, or to consent to a division of it, through the agency of a Court.\n He chose the latter mode. He himself with the salvors, applied to the justice to issue process; and he co-operated in all the subsequent proceedings, and he received his proportion of the sale of the part of the cargo which was saved. These acts were subsequently ratified by the agent, who it is in evidence offered the claimant 7500 dollars for his bargain.\n Upon these facts it is contended, that the consent of the party operates as a change of title to the property. It will not supply a defect of power in the Court, acting as a Court, but the Court is the mere organ of the will of the party. As between the original parties, a plaintiff may take advantage of the want of jurisdiction of the Court to which he has resorted. But can he obtain judgment, proceed to execution, obtain a sale, under which a third person purchases; and then dispute the title of that third person, for all alleged want of jurisdiction in the Court?\n The Court at Key West had jurisdiction, and its decree cannot be questioned.\n It may be proper to consider in the first place, whether the jurisdiction of the Key West Court, can be inquired into by this Court? Was it not the judge of its own jurisdiction? It was a municipal Court, acting, in rem, under a municipal law. 2 Dal. 273. 2 Blac. Rep. 977. 4 T. R. 191. 2 H. Blac. 410. 4 Cranch, 271. 268. 275-6. 293. 3 Wheat. 236, note. 15 John. 144. 1 Stark. 215-16. 9 Mass. 46. 9 East, 192.\n In Rose vs. Himely, 4 Cranch, 268, it is said, 'but of their own jurisdiction, so far as it depends on municipal laws, the Courts of every country are the exclusive judges.'\n Can the Key West Court be considered a foreign Court? It was constituted by Congress, or by a power derived from Congress; yet it may be considered that the United States has two sovereignties, one over the people of the United States, the other over the territories; and that they are as foreign to each other, as the parliament of England, and the legislature of Jamaica; and that the Courts of each are as foreign as the Courts of Westminster and Kingston. Perhaps a distinction may be also taken between the power of this Court, to inquire into the jurisdiction of another Court, in a case in which a third person, not a party to the original suit, defends his right to the property purchased under that judgment, and a case where a party to the original judgment, seeks to enforce that judgment in this Court, and thereby to acquire new rights under it. Another \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 532]\n\u00a0\n distinction may be taken between a defect of jurisdiction, in consequence of the absence of some fact necessary to confer jurisdiction, and that want of jurisdiction which arises from the different construction put upon a municipal law by this Court, from the construction adopted by the municipal Court.\n Instead of considering the territorial Court of Florida, a strictly foreign Court, suppose the same right to inquire into its jurisdiction, that exists in inquire into the jurisdiction of a state Court, is admitted.\n As a general principle, it is true, that the proceedings of a Court are void, unless it has jurisdiction over the subject matter. This however, like all general rules, has its limits and its qualifications.\n Whether the subject matter, (the person, or property,) is within the power of the Court, is a question of fact, to be decided, generally, by the return of an officer. The Court may be supposed to act upon the existence of that fact. When it is proved in another Court, that the Court whose jurisdiction is questioned had been deceived as to that essential fact, it does not impugn its judgment, to say that it acted without jurisdiction.\n But the construction of the statutes of the states, is peculiarly the province of the Courts of the state; and a uniform construction becomes the settled law of the state. The jurisdiction cannot be settled in any other way, than by the Courts of the state. It presents a question of law, and the decision of that question, though it relates to jurisdiction, is as binding upon the parties, as though it related to the merits of the case. The question as to the extent of the power of the Court under a statute, is a question of law, and the decision conclusive on the parties.\n The Courts of Florida alone, are to construe the Acts of Congress in relation to the jurisdiction of Florida. Had the justice, at Key West, jurisdiction of the question of salvage? By the territorial Act of 1823, called the 'Wreckers' Act,' it is admitted, that sufficient authority was given to the Justice over this subject. The question arises out of the Act of Congress of March 1823; and is this, does that Act of Congress grant sufficient power to the legislature of Florida to pass such a law? The Act of Congress of March 1823, authorizes the territorial legislature, 'to legislate upon all rightful subjects of legislation.'\n It makes it the duty of the governor to lay before Congress, annually, all the Acts passed by the legislature. If either of those Acts are disapproved of by Congress, it is, from thenceforth, to be of no effect. The Act concerning wreckers was laid before \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 533]\n\u00a0\n Congress in December 1823, and its attention particularly pointed to that subject, by a memorial in which the necessity of such a law was enforced. Congress did not disapprove or annul that law, until 1826. In the opinion of Congress, then, this law did not violate the provisions of the Constitution, or of any general law of the United States.\n It ought to be noticed, that the right conferred on the territorial legislature 'to legislate upon all rightful subjects of legislation,' was qualified by the condition, that no law should be valid 'if inconsistent with the Constitution or laws of the United States.'\n Much argument has been used in order to show that the Constitution and laws of the United States are, per se, in force in Florida, and that the inhabitants are citizens of the United States.\n How the Constitution became of force in Florida has not been shown. Was it by the Act of cession? Is there any principle in the law of nations, which upon the Act of cession or conquest, gives to the ceded or conquered country, a right to participate in the privileges of the Constitution of the parent country? The usages of nations from the period of Grecian colonization to the present moment, are precisely the reverse. Such a right never was asserted.\n The Constitution was established by the people of the United States for the United States. It provides for the future admission of territories into the Union, and expressly confers upon Congress the power of governing them as territories, until they are admitted as states.\n If the Constitution is in force in Florida, why is it not represented in Congress? Why was it necessary to pass an Act of Congress extending several of the laws of the United States to Florida? Why did Congress designate particular laws, such as the crimes Act, the slave trade and revenue Acts, and introduce them as laws into Florida? Why enumerate particular rights secured to the people of the United States, if the inhabitants of Florida were entitled to them upon the Act of cession?\n It is denied, that all the cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction are exclusively vested in the Courts of the Union. On the contrary it is asserted, that many cases within the admiralty are also within the common law jurisdiction of the state Courts. Seamen's wages, salvage, marine torts, collision, &c. are of this description. 2 Doug. 614. Abb. on Ship. 433. 436. 3 Bos. & Pul. 612. 8 East, 57. 2 Selw. N.

It is vested in the Courts of the Union; exclusive of the Courts of the states. The state Courts are constituted by state legislatures, over which Congress had no control. They are in a measure adverse jurisdictions. If it is admitted that Congress has no power to vest any part of admiralty jurisdiction in the state Courts, over which it has no control, how does it follow that it has no power to vest it in a territorial Court, over which it has control?\n Congress can constitute new Courts within the states, and confer portions of admiralty jurisdiction upon them. It can confer that jurisdiction upon the superior or inferior Courts of the territory, or it can authirize the territorial legislature to do it. And this, whether the Constitution is or is not in force in Florida.\n The power of Congress over the territory is the same in the one case as in the other. The Constitution authorizes Congress to provide for the government of the territories. It has all the power over them, that Congress and the legislature of a state, have over a state. Its power to appoint Courts of admiralty jurisdiction, can be as legally delegated, as its power to appoint any other Courts. All the Courts of Florida, whether appointed by Congress or by the territorial legislature, are dependent upon Congress, and are Courts of the United States. They are therefore, upon the admission of the opposite counsel, capable of receiving grants of admiralty jurisdiction. It is only state Courts, which are independent of Congress, that cannot be clothed with such power. If the power of Congress to distribute admiralty jurisdiction among the Courts of the territory as it pleases, is denied, its power to distribute it among the Courts of the United States as it pleases, must be denied. Of what consequence is it then, whether the Constitution is or is not in force in Florida, since the Constitution excludes the state Courts alone from the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction?\n The ground assumed is this, that Congress authorized the territorial legislature 'to legislate upon all rightful subjects of legislation,' unless inconsistent with the Constitution. That salvage is a rightful, and in Florida a necessary subject of legislation; that the necessary import of the words of this grant includes the exercise of the power in question; that the exercise of that power, by enacting the wrecker's Act, was not inconsistent with the Constitution or laws of the United States; and that consequently it must be supported, unless it can be clearly shown that it is inconsistent with some other parts of the Act of Congress of March 1823. \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 535]\n\u00a0\n This is attempted by resorting to the 8th section, which confers jurisdiction upon the Superior Courts of Florida. These Superior Courts were appointed by Congress, and jurisdiction was conferred by Congress, and the argument is that as Congress have conferred exclusive admiralty jurisdiction upon these Courts of its own appointment, that the power given to the legislature in the same Act to appoint other inferior Courts, and 'to legialate upon all rightful subjects of legislation,' was not intended to include the power over subjects of admiralty jurisdiction.\n As the necessary import of the terms of the grant to the legislature does include the power in question, it must be shown that the necessary import of the grant of jurisdiction to the Superior Courts excludes it. Words of a clear import are not to be controlled by other words in the same statute, unless their import is equally clear; for doubtful words shall not limit the operation of clear and precise ones.\n Two propositions must be established, as the necessary result of these words of the 8th section. 1st. That an exclusive admiralty jurisdiction is conferred upon the Superior Courts. 2nd. That that exclusive jurisdiction extends to all cases.\n The words are the 'same jurisdiction.' And it is argued that because the jurisdiction of the Kentucky Court was exclusive, that these terms, necessarily, vest an exclusive jurisdiction in the Superior Courts.\n The grant is 'the same jurisdiction.' Must it necessarily be exclusive in Florida because it was exclusive in Kentucky? Are the terms, exclusive or concurrent, parts of qualities of the jurisdiction, so that a grant of the principle carries them along with it, as incidents? Or are they in fact no part of the jurisdiction itself, but terms used to express the relation which that Court has to some other Court? Is not the term exclusive intended to prohibit other Courts from exercising the same jurisdiction? Is a jurisdiction more extensive when exclusive, or less so when concurrent? Is it not precisely the same in the one case as in the other? The power of the Court over the parties, the subject matter and the process, is the same in the one case as in the other. A grant then of the ' same jurisdiction,' does not necessarily carry with it the same relation to other jurisdictions. It may be concurrent in Kentucky, and exclusive in Florida. Suppose two Courts in Florida whose jurisdiction extended over the same district. Congress confers upon these two Courts the 'same jurisdiction,' that the Kentucky Court possessed. It was exclusive in Kentucky, but as it was conferred on two Courts, would it not be concurrent in Florida?\n These terms, then, do not necessarily import an exclusive \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 536]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction, and ought not to limit the grant of power to the legislature. The intention of Congress might have been one way or the other. It is probable they did not intend an exclusive jurisdiction. In Kentucky this admiralty power is exclusive of the state Courts, over which Congress has no control. Why in Florida should it be exclusive of the territorial Courts over which Congress had a control.\n The libellants then fail to establish the first proposition, that the necessary import of the terms confers an exclusive jurisdiction on the Superior Courts. The second proposition it is apprehended cannot be established, which is, that jurisdiction over all cases, to which the jurisdiction of the Kentucky Court extended, was intended to be conferred. The words of the Act are 'all cases arising under the laws of the United States.'\n It is at once perceived, that unless it can be established that the case of salvage tried before the justice and jury was a case arising under the law of the United States, that Congress have not conferred jurisdiction over it, on the Superior Courts, and consequently that the territorial legislature had the right of conferring it upon an inferior Court.\n The reasoning adopted to show, that it was a case arising under the laws of the United States is somewhat novel. The jurisdiction of the justice depended upon the territorial law; the right of the territorial legislation to enact that law depended on the Act of Congress; it was therefore a case arising under the laws of the United States. And the case of Osborne vs. the Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738, is relied upon as an authority.\n The case of Osborne vs. the Bank, did not involve the right of the bank to use in a particular Court, not a mere question of jurisdiction, but the right of the bank to sue in any Court; its right to a legal existence. The fact of the legal existence of the bank depended on a law of the United States. The decision of the question settled the case between the parties. No suit could be afterwards brought by the bank in another Court. But, if the justice in Florida had decided against his own jurisdiction, it would have left the rights of the parties as they were before, to be decided upon in another Court. It would have effected the remedy in that Court, and that alone.\n Besides, if every case which involves a question of jurisdiction under a law of the United States, is a case arising under the laws of the United States, then every case which by possibility can be brought in the Kentucky Court is of that description, because every case involves that question. What meaning then have the words 'arising under the laws of the United States?' Why not omit them entirely and read the section thus, 'the same jurisdiction in all cases which the Kentucky Court \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 537]\n\u00a0\n has.' If those words do not limit the grant to cases where some right is claimed under a law, they are whooly inoperative.\n It will be found, not only that these words are inoperative upon the construction of the libellants, but that distinct and independent provisions in the Act of Congress of 1824, are also inoperative. Immediately following these words conferring jurisdiction upon the Superior Courts, it is provided that 'all cases arising under the laws of the United States' shall be tried the first six days of the term, and all other cases afterwards; that in such cases the Clerk shall have the same fees that the Clerks of the District Courts have, but in all other cases, such fees as the legislature shall establish. Now if every case brought in a territorial Court, involves a question of the jurisdiction of the Court, and that alone gives it the character of 'a case under the laws of the United States,' according to the meaning of Congress, how can the distinction as to the time of trial, and the amount of fees exist? Congress has established two classes of cases, one under, and the other not under, the law of the United States. The libellants say there is but one class. All cases brought in the Courts of Florida are cases arising under the laws of the United States, because they all involve a question of jurisdiction. This view of the subject appears conclusive.\n The whole case results in this, that Congress, being the sovereign, de facto, or under the Constitution of Florida, had a right to provide for its government by a direct or a delegated exercise of power, or by both. That it had the right of distributing all branches of judicial power among the several Courts of Florida as it pleased, and how it pleased, and this to the same extent if the Constitution is, or if it is not, per se, in force in Florida.\n That the grant of power to the territorial legislature clearly embraces the exercise of it in question, and that so far from a clear grant of exclusive jurisdiction in all admiralty cases, being conferred upon the Superior Courts, which could alone limit the grant of power to the legislature, that it is very doubtful whether any exclusive jurisdiction was intended, and if it was, it was only in relation to cases in which some right or power is claimed under a law of the United States. It is agreed that salvage is not of that description, unless the possibility of a question of jurisdiction makes it so.\n Mr. Webster--\n This will be a hard case against the claimant of the property, should he lose it, having purchased it in good faith under the decree of a Court exercising jurisdiction over the matter, and to which jurisdiction, no objection was made, by the parties to the proceeding. \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 538]\n\u00a0\n How did the District Court of South Carolina obtain jurisdiction in this case? No wrong was done-no tort was committed. That Court had not therefore jurisdiction of the subject. Salvage is too indefinite a term, to designate jurisdiction. Marine salvage, when the service has been rendered at sea, may form a proceeding in the admiralty, but in this case, the services were after the vessel was a wreck; and therefore the same principles do not apply.\n This proceeding is in the nature of an action of trespass; the process was against the res, and and person of the claimant; and because there had been a question of salvage in the Court under whose decree the res is held by the claimant, it does not follow, that there is jurisdiction in the Courts of the United States. It is said the property has not passed by any valid decree, and trespass or trover would lie.\n Has there been such a judicial sale, as conveyed the property to the claimant?-If not, the insurance companies claim to hold the property. What is Florida? It is no part of the United States. How can it be?-how is it represented? do the laws of the United States reach Florida? Not unless by particular provisions. The territory and all within it, are to be governed by the acquiring power, except where there are reservations by treaty. By the law of England, when possession is taken of territories, the kind, Jure Coronae, has the power of legislation until parliament shall interfere. Congress have the Jus Coronae in this case, and Florida was to be governed by Congress as she thought proper.\n What has Congress done? she might have done any thing-she might have refused the trial by jury, and refused a legislature. She has given a legislature, to be exercised at her will; and a government of a mixed nature, in which she has endeavoured to distinguish between state and United States jurisdiction, anticipating the future erection of the territory into a state.\n Does the law establishing the Court at Key West, come within the restrictions of the Constitution of the United States? If the Constitution does not extend over this territory, the law cannot be inconsistent with the national Constitution. It is said that the Court erected for the territory by the law of the United States, has exclusive jurisdiction over this case, and that the interference of the local legislature is unauthorized. Does the law erecting the Superior Court of Florida, give this exclusive jurisdiction?\n The jurisdiction given to the Florida Court is the same as that given to the Circuit Court of Kentucky; and as the District Court of Kentucky has jurisdiction of all cases arising under \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 539]\n\u00a0\n the laws of the United States, it is inferred, that the same is vested in the Florida Court. But it does not follow from the language of the Act, that the jurisdiction is exclusive; and thus the power of the Court erected by the legislature of Florida, may be and was concurrent. The main point in this case is, whether it is a case arising under the Constitution of the United States? What are the cases which are referred to in the provision, and is this one?\n The principles of those cases have been examined, and enough has been settled, to show that this is one which does not so arise. A case is not one arising under a law of the United States, because, in some part of it, a question may arise under a law of the United States. The meaning of the provision of the Constitution cannot be, that when a law of the United States can have any influence in a case, it is to be considered as one arising under the law of the United States.\n How does the case before the Court arise under a law of the United States? It is a claim for salvage. The goods are brought into Key West, and there is no law of the United States limiting or fixing the amount of salvage. Salvage is not a right arising under a law of the United States- it is a common law right; and the action for its recovery, or the rate to be allowed, does not depend upon any law of the United States. It cannot be claimed, that any laws operated in the case, unless the general laws which extended over the territory. The case of Osborn vs. the Bank of the United States, decided in this Court, does not apply to this case. The law giving to the bank their charter, gave to that institution a power to sue in the Courts of the United States. But, as has been stated, the salvors of the cotton, did not claim salvage under any law of the Union. The salvage might have been sued for, wherever the goods could be found and libelled, in England or in France, or elsewhere.\n The argument, that this Court should lay its hands on the proceedings of the Courts of Key West, because of the great in juries sustained by merchants and underwriters, if it could, at any time, have force here, cannot have it now; as the law establishing the Court which is so much complained of has been repealed.\n Mr. Ogden in reply.\n The place where the service is done, ascertains the jurisdiction. It is upon this principle, that questions of seamen's wages are subjects of admiralty jurisdiction, and entertained in Admiralty Courts; and upon this principle, the case before the Court, is of admiralty cognizance. The whole of the services of the salvors were at sea; the place where the Point a Petre was wrecked, was at a distance from the main land, and there the goods were saved. \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 540]\n\u00a0\n It is admitted, that for the cotton, which is the subject of this suit, an action of trover will lie; but this is a concurrent remedy with that afforded in a Court of Admiralty.\n Territories acquired by conquest, and by cession, stand under different relations to the United States. Where territories are ceded, they become part of the United States. It has been the uniform understanding, that this shall be the case. Those territories obtained by treaties with France and Spain, were so considered, and the provisions in those treaties relative to the rights and privileges of the inhabitants, were introduced under the belief that Congress would not interfere.\n The Act relative to the territory of Florida provides, that no law shall be passed against the provisions of the Constitution of the United States. The officers appointed under it, take an oath to support the Constitution, and thus the full force and operation of the Constitution is acknowledged in the territory.\n By the Constitution, the Courts of the United States have jurisdiction in all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; and it therefore follows, that this is exclusive. What Courts have Congress ordained and established in the territory of Florida, to exercise the jurisdiction assigned by the Constitution to the Courts of the United States? The law establishes a Superior Court with general jurisdiction, similar to the Courts established in the states; it then provides that inferior Courts may be erected by the territorial legislature, whose jurisdiction shall not exceed one hundred dollars; and it is afterwards said in the law, that the Superior Court shall, in addition to the difined powers, exercise all such powers as are granted to the United States Court of Kentucky. The Court established in Kentucky has given to it admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and therefore the Superior Court of Florida has the same jurisdiction. If, then, it is given by Congress to the Superior Court, it exists nowhere else.\n It is said that Congress has given to the territorial legislature all the rights of legislation they have. Legislative powers cannot be delegated. Delegatus non potest delegare.\n Whether the territorial Court had jurisdiction, is a question arising under the Constitution of the United States. How else does it arise? Suppose a jurisdiction in admiralty cases, assumed by New-York during a war. How can the powers thus assumed by examined before the Courts of the United States, but by affirming the Acts to be void by the Constitution and laws of the United States?\n This is a question of salvage; and had the territorial Court jurisdiction of salvage? If the cotton was not sold under the decree of a Court competent to decide such a question, the \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 541]\n\u00a0\n property is not changed. Does the territorial Act give the jurisdiction? The powers of Courts formed under the territorial law, being limited to controversies not exceeding one hundred dollars, the limitation has been exceeded; and the provisions for the establishment of the Court are therefore void.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.--\n The plaintiffs filed their libel in this cause in the District Court of South Carolina, to obtain restitution of 356 bales of cotton, part of the cargo of the ship Point a Petre; which had been insured by them on a voyage from New-Orleans to Havre de Grace, in France. The Point a Petre was wrecked on the coast of Florida, the cargo saved by the inhabitants, and carried into Key West, where it was sold for the purpose of satisfying the salvors; by virtue of a decree of a Court, consisting of a notary and five jurors, which was erected by an Act of the territorial legislature of Florida. The owners abandoned to the underwriters, who having accepted the same, proceeded against the property; alleging that the sale was not made by order of a Court competent to change the property.\n David Canter claimed the cotton as a bona fide purchaser, under the decree of a competent Court, which awarded seventy-six per cent. to the salvors, on the value of the property saved. The District Judge pronounced the decree of the territorial Court a nullity, and awarded restitution to the libellants of such part of the cargo as he supposed to be identified by the evidence; deducting therefrom a salvage of fifty per cent.\n The libellants and claimant both appealed. The Circuit Court reversed the decree of the District Court, and decreed the whole cotton to the claimant, with costs; on the ground that the proceedings of the Court at Key West were legal, and transferred the property to the purchaser.\n From this decree the libellants have appealed to this Court. The cause depends, mainly, on the question whether the proparty in the cargo saved, was changed by the sale at Key West. The conformity of that sale to the order under which it was made, has not been controverted. Its validity has been denied, on the ground that it was ordered by an incompetent tribunal.\n The tribunal was constituted by an Act of the territorial legislature of Florida, passed on the 4th July 1823, which is inserted in the record. That Act purports to give the power which has been exercised; consequently the sale is valid, if the territorial legislature was competent to enact the law. The course which the argument has taken, will requlre, that, \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 542]\n\u00a0\n in deciding this question, the Court should take into view the relation in which Florida stands to the United States.\n The Constitution confers absolutely on the government of the Union, the powers of making war, and of making treaties; consequently, that government possesses the power of acquiring territory, either by conquest or by treaty.\n The usage of the world is, if a nation be not entirely submilitary to consider the holding of conquered territory as a mere military occupation, until its fate shall be determined at the treaty of peace. If it be ceded by the treaty, the acquisition is confirmed, and the ceded territory becomes a part of the nation to which it is annexed; either on the terms stipulated in the treaty of cession, or on such as its new master shall impose. On such transfer of territory, it has never been held, that the relations of the inhabitants with each other undergo any change. Their relations with their former sovereign are dissolved, and new relations are created between them, and the government which has acquired their territory. The same Act which transfers their country, transfers the allegiance of those who remain in it; and the law, which may be denominated political, is necessarily changed, although that which regulates the intercourse, and general conduct of individuals, remains in force, until altered by the newly created power of the state.\n On the 2d of February 1819, Spain ceded Florida to the United States. The 6th article of the treaty of cession, contains the following provision- 'The inhabitants of the territories, which his Catholic majesty cedes to the United States by this treaty, shall be incorporated in the Union of the United States, as soon as may be consistent with the principles of the federal Constitution; and admitted to the enjoyment of the privileges, rights, and immunities of the citizens of the United States.'\n This treaty is the law of the land, and admits the inhabitants of Florida to the enjoyment of the privileges, rights, and immunities, of the citizens of the United States. It is unnecessary to inquire, whether this is not their condition, independent of stipulation. They do not, however, participate in political power; they do not share in the government, till Florida shall become a state. In the mean time, Florida continues to be a territory of the United States; governed by virtue of that clause in the Constitution, which empowers Congress 'to make all needful rules and regulations, respecting the territory, or other property belonging to the United States.'\n Perhaps the power of governing a territory belonging to the United States, which has not, by becoming a state, acquired the means of self- government, may result necessarily from the facts, that it is not within the jurisdiction of any particular state, and is within the power and jurisdiction of the United \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 543]\n\u00a0\n States. The right to govern, may be the inevitable consequence of the right to acquire territory. Whichever may be the source, whence the power is derived, the possession of it is unquestioned. In execution of it, Congress, in 1822, passed 'an Act for the establishment of a territorial government in Florida;' and, on the 3d of March 1823, passed another Act to amend the Act of 1822. Under this Act, the territorial legislature enacted the law now under consideration.\n The 5th section of the Act of 1823, creates a territorial legislature, which shall have legislative powers over all rightful objects of legislation; but no law shall be valid, which is inconsistent with the laws and Constitution of the United States.\n The 7th section enacts 'That the judicial power shall be vested in two Superior Courts, and in such inferior Courts, and justices of the peace, as the legislative council of the territory may from time to time establish.' After prescribing the place of cession, and the jurisdictional limits of each Court, the Act proceeds to say; 'within its limits herein described, each Court shall have jurisdiction in all criminal cases, and exclusive jurisdiction in all capital offences; and original jurisdiction in all civil cases of the value of one hundred dollars, arising under and cognizable by the laws of the territory, now in force therein, or which may, at any time, be enacted by the legislative council thereof.'\n The 8th section enacts 'That each of the said Superior Courts shall moreover have and exercise the same jurisdiction within its limits, in all cases arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States, which, by an Act to establish the judicial Courts of the United States, approved the 24th of September 1789, and an Act in addition to the Act, entitled an Act to establish the judicial Courts of the United States, approved the 2d of March 1793, was vested in the Court of Kentucky district.'\n The powers of the territorial legislature extend to all rightful objects of legislation, subject to the restriction, that their laws shall not be 'inconsistent with the laws and Constitution of the United States.' As salvage is admitted to come within this description, the Act is valid, unless it can be brought within the restriction.\n The counsel for the libellants contend, that it is inconsistent with both the law and the Constitution; that it is inconsistent with the provisions of the law, by which the territorial government was created, and with the amendatory Act of March 1823. It vests, they say, in an inferior tribunal, a jurisdiction, which is, by those Acts, vested exclusively in the Superior Courts of the territory. \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 544]\n\u00a0\n This argument requires an attentive consideration of the sections which define the jurisdiction of the Superior Courts.\n The 7th section of the Act of 1823, vests the whole judicial power of the territory 'in two Superior Courts, and in such inferior Courts, and justices of the peace, as the legislative council of the territory may from time to time establish.' This general grant is common to the superior and inferior Courts, and their jurisdiction is concurrent, except so far as it may be made exclusive in either, by other provisions of the statute. The jurisdiction of the Superior Courts, is declared to be exclusive over capital offences; on every other question over which those Courts may take cognizance by virtue of this section, concurrent jurisdiction may be given to the inferior Courts. Among these subjects, are 'all civil cases arising under and cognizable by the laws of the territory, now in force therein, or which may at any time be enacted by the legislative council thereof.'\n It has been already stated, that all the laws which were in force in Florida while a province of Spain, those excepted which were political in their character, which concerned the relations between the people and their sovereign, remained in force, until altered by the government of the United States. Congress recognises this principle, by using the words 'laws of the territory now in force therein.' No laws could then have been in force, but those enacted by the Spanish government. If among these, a law existed on the subject of salvage, and it is scarcely possible there should not have been such a law, jurisdiction over cases arising under it, was conferred on the Superior Courts, but that jurisdiction was not exclusive. A territorial Act, conferring jurisdiction over the same cases on a inferior Court, would not have been inconsistent with this section.\n The 8th section extends the jurisdiction of the Superior Courts, in terms which admit of more doubt. The words are 'That each of the said Superior Courts, shall moreover have and exercise the same jurisdiction, within its limits, in all cases arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States, which, by an Act to establish the judicial Courts of the United States, was vested in the Court of the Kentucky district.'\n The 11th section of the Act declares 'That the laws of the United States, relating to the revenue and its collection, and all other public Acts of the United States, not inconsistent or repugnant to this Act, shall extend to, and have full force and effect, in the territory aforesaid.'\n The laws which are extended to the territory by this section, were either for the punishment of crime, or for civil \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 545]\n\u00a0\n purposes. Jurisdiction is given in all criminal cases, by the 7th section, but in civil cases, that section gives jurisdiction only in those which arise under and are cognizable by the laws of the territory; consequently, all civil cases arising under the laws which are extended to the territory by the 11th section, are cognizable in the territorial Courts, by virtue of the 8th section; and, in those cases, the Superior Courts may exercise the same jurisdiction, as is exercised by the Court for the Kentucky district.\n The question suggested by this view of the subject, on which the case under consideration must depend, is this:--\n Is the admiralty jurisdiction of the District Courts of the United States vested in the Superior Courts of Florida under the words of the 8th section, declaring that each of the said Courts 'shall moreover have and exercise the same jurisdiction within its limits, in all cases arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States,' which was vested in the Courts of the Kentucky district?\n It is observable, that this clause does not confer on the territorial Courts all the jurisdiction which is vested in the Court of the Kentucky district, but that part of it only which applies to 'cases arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States.' Is a case of admiralty of this description?\n The Constitution and laws of the United States, give jurisdiction to the District Courts over all cases in admiralty; but jurisdiction over the case, does not constitute the case itself. We are therefore to inquire, whether cases in admiralty, and cases arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States, are identical.\n If we have recourse to that pure fountain from which all the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts is derived, we find language employed which cannot well be misunderstood. The Constitution declares, that 'the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, or other public ministers, and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.'\n The Constitution certainly contemplates these as three distinct classes of cases; and if they are distinct, the grant of jurisdiction over one of them, does not confer jurisdiction over either of the other two. The discrimination made between them, in the Constitution, is, we think, conclusive against their identity. If it were not so, if this were a point open to inquiry, it would be difficult to maintain the proposition that they are the same. A case in admiralty does not, in fact, arise under the Constitution or laws of the United States. These cases \n\n[26 U.S. 511, 546]\n\u00a0\n are as old as navigation itself; and the law, admiralty and maritime, as it has existed for ages, is applied by our Courts to the cases as they arise. It is not then to the 8th section of the territorial law, that we are to look for the grant of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, to the territorial Courts. Consequently, if that jurisdiction is exclusive, it is not made so by the reference to the District Court of Kentucky.\n It has been contended, that by the Constitution the judicial power of the United States extends to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; and that the whole of this judicial power must be vested 'in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as Congress shall from time to time ordain and establish.' Hence it has been argued, that Congress cannot vest admiralty jurisdiction in Courts created by the territorial legislature.\n We have only to pursue this subject one step further, to perceive that this provision of the Constitution does not apply to it. The next sentence declares, that 'the Judges both of the Supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour.' The Judges of the Superior Courts of Florida hold their offices for four years. These Courts, then, are not constitutional Courts, in which the judicial power conferred by the Constitution on the general government, can be deposited. They are incapable of receiving it. They are legislative Courts, created in virtue of the general right of sovereignty which exists in the government, or in virtue of that clause which enables Congress to make all needful rules and regulations, respecting the territory belonging to the United States. The jurisdiction with which they are invested, is not a part of that judicial power which is defined in the 3d article of the Constitution, but is conferred by Congress, in the execution of those general powers which that body possesses over the territories of the United States. Although admiralty jurisdiction can be exercised in the states in those Courts, only, which are established in pursuance of the 3d article of the Constitution; the same limitation does not extend to the territories. In legislating for them, Congress exercises the combined powers of the general, and of a state government.\n We think, then, that the Act of the territorial legislature, erecting the Court by whose decree the cargo of the Point a Petre was sold, is not 'inconsistent with the laws and Constitution of the United States,' and is valid. Consequently, the sale made in pursuance of it changed the property, and the decree of the Circuit Court, awarding restitution of the property to the claimant, ought to be affirmed with costs. \n\nFootnotes\n but it appears, that after being saved from the wreck, it was deposited at Key West, where it was sold and purchased by Canter the claimant, under the order of a municipal Court, constituted under a law of Florida, with jurisdiction over cases of salvage.\n The preliminary question alone, has now been argued, to wit, whether the sale by that Court was effectual to divest the interest of the underwriters.\n The general principle is not denied, as to the mutations of property, which takes place through the intervention of Courts of Justice; but it was argued that the Constitution of the United States vests the admiralty jurisdiction exclusively in the general government-that no state can exercise a concurrent jurisdiction over admiralty and maritime causes, and that salvage was of that description. Wherefore the legislature of Florida had, in organizing this Court, exercised a power not legally vested in it, and the Act constituting it, being a void Act, it was as though no such Court existed. That moreover, the nullity of that Court did not rest merely on an inherent want of power to constitute it, but on positive prohibition contained in the Acts organizing the government of the territory to pass any laws contrary to the laws and Constitution of the United States. \nThat the Act organizing this Court, was an Act of this nature, inasmuch as jurisdiction of causes, admiralty and maritime, were expressly vested in the Superior Courts of Florida; and, that, without the right of exercising a concurrent power over the subject, vesting this jurisdiction in an inferior Court, is quoad hoc, divesting the Superior Court of its jurisdiction, and rendering null the Act of Congress, which vests the admiralty jurisdiction in that alone.\n On the other hand, it has been contended, that salvage is a subject of municipal and common law cognizance, not exclusively belonging to the admiralty; that although the Constitution may vest the exclusive cognizance of admiralty and maritime causes in the United States, in those instances in which the admiralty at the adoption of the Constitution, had exclusive jurisdiction of the subject, yet, in those cases, in which the common law exercised a concurrent jurisdiction with the admiralty, there is no reason for carrying the grant beyond a concurrent jurisdiction with the common law Courts of the states.\n That the Court which ordered this sale was properly a municipal Court, and a Court of a separate and distinct jurisdiction from the Courts of the United States, and as such, its acts are not to be reviewed in a foreign tribunal; of which description it was contended, were the Courts of the United States for South Carolina District. That the District of Florida was no part of the United States, but only an acquisition or dependency, and as such the Constitution, per se, had no binding effect in or over it; and finally that the argument drawn from the assumed fact, that the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction was by law expressly vested in another Court, originates in a misconstruction of the law, inasmuch as no Act of Congress vests in the Superior Court any other portion of the jurisdiction of the Kentucky Court, than that of causes arising under the laws of the United States; that this is not a cause of that description, it is one arising under a casualty in which no law of the United States came necessarily under review. \n To this it was replied, that it was a cause arising under a law of the United States, and the case of Osborne vs. The Bank of the United States, was quoted and insisted on as furnishing a decision in point. That if the cause there was one of that description, because the Bank was incorporated by a law of the United States, for the same reason was this a cause of that description, because the body politic here was like the body corporate there, created by a law of the United States; and, if at every step there, the Court was met by the law which made the one a bank, gave it power to make by laws, and to act under those by-laws, so was it equally met here, by the laws which made this a state, gave it power to legislate, and legalized this transfer of property, under laws, which without the laws of the United States, were mere nullities.\n It becomes indispensable to the solution of these difficulties, that we should conceive a just idea of the relation in which Florida stands to the United States; and give a correct construction to the second section of the Act of Congress, of May the 26th, 1824, respecting the territorial government of Florida; correct views on these two subjects, will dispose of all the points that have been considered in argument.\n And first, it is obvious, that there is a material distinction between the territory now under consideration, and that which is acquired from the aborigines (whether by purchase or conquest,) within the acknowledged limits of the United States, as also that which is acquired by the establishment of a disputed line. As to both these there can be no question, that the sovereignty of the state or territory within which it lies, and of the United States, immediately attach, producing a complete subjection to all the laws and institutions of the two governments, local and general, unless modified by treaty.\n The question now to be considered, relates to territories previously subject to the acknowledged jurisdiction of another sovereign; such as was Florida to the crown of Spain. And on this subject, we have the most explicit proof, that the understanding of our public functionaries, is, that the government and laws of the United States do not extend to such territory by the mere Act of cession. For, in the Act of Congress, of March 30th, 1822, section 9th, we have an enumeration of the Acts of Congress, which are to be held in force in the territory; and, in the 10th section an enumeration, in nature of a bill of rights, of privileges, and immunities which could not be denied to the inhabitants of the territory, if they came under the Constitution by the mere Act of cession.\n As, however, the opinion of our public functionaries is not conclusive, we will review the provisions of the Constitution on this subject.\n At the time the Constitution was formed, the limits of the territory over which it was to operate were generally defined and recognised. These limits consisted in part, of organized states, and in part of territories, the absolute property and dependencies of the United States. These states, this territory, and future states to be admitted into the Union, are the sole objects of the Constitution; there is no express provision whatever made in the Constitution for the acquisition or government of territories beyond those limits. \n The right, therefore, of acquiring territory is altogether incidental to the treaty-making power, and perhaps to the power of admitting new states into the Union; and the government of such acquisitions is, of course, left to the legislative power of the Union, as far as that power is uncontrouled by treaty. By the latter we acquire either positively or sub modo, and by the former dispose of acquisitions so made; and in case of such acquisitions, I see nothing in which the power acquired over the ceded territories, can vary from the power acquired under the law of nations by any other government over acquired or ceded territory. The laws, rights and institutions of the territory so acquired remain in full force, until rightfully altered by the new government. In the present instance, however, the laws of Florida were not left to derive their force from general principles alone; for by the 13th section of the same Act it is declared, 'That the laws in force in the said territory at the commencement of this Act, and not inconsistent with the provisions thereof, shall continue in force until altered, modified or repealed by the legislature.\n From these views of the subject it results,\n 1st. That whatever may be the correct idea of the distribution of the admiralty jurisdictions as between the states and United States, it can have no application here, since this territory does not stand in the relation of a state to the United States.\n 2ndly. That whether salvage be of admiralty jurisdiction exclusively or not, it is immaterial to this cause, since the whole power of legislation over the subject in Florida, existed exclusively in the general government.\n 3dly. That the general principles of international law, on the immunities of foreign courts and foreign decisions, have no application here, since the Courts of Florida have a common origin with this Court-our authority flows from the same source-we are connected at the fountain head, governed by the same legislative power, and have equal access to the laws which constitute and governs us. It follows, that neither can regard the decisions of the other, if acting without authority derived through the legislature of the Union. The Act entitled 'An Act for the establishment of a territorial government in Florida,' and the Act in pari materia, of the 3d March 1823, and the 26th May 1824, constitute what may be properly termed the Constitution of Florida. The first provides for the appointment of an executive, with powers not material here to be considered. It constitutes a Legislature, organizes a Judiciary, and imposes upon the one and the other some general restrictions, subject to which they are empowered to exercise the legislative, judicial and executive powers which belong generally to an organized government.\n The Act of March 1823 goes over the same ground, and repeals the preceding Act so far as the provisions of the latter are inconsistent with those of the former Act. And with regard to both, or either, as far as the latter remains unrepealed, the position is incontrovertible, that the legislative power could enact nothing inconsistent with what Congress has made inherent and permanent in the form of government of the territory. Therefore, if the admiralty jurisdiction is made inherent in the Superior Courts, it was not in the power of the territorial legislature to transfer it to any inferior tribunal. \n To determine this question, we must examine the provisions of the several acts, touching the exercise of legislative and judicial power.\n In defining the legislative power, the words of the Act of 1822 are these, 'they shall have power to alter, modify, or repeal the laws, which may be in force at the commencement of this Act. These legislative powers, shall, also, extend to all the rightful subjects of legislation; but no law shall be valid, which is inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or which lay any person under restraint, burthen or disability, on account of his religious opinions, professions or worship; in all which he shall be free to maintain his own, and not to be burthened with those of another.'\n The language of the Act of 1823 is, 'they shall have legislative power over all rightful subjects of legislation; but, no law shall be valid, which is inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States; or, which lay any person under restraint, &c.'\n That jurisdiction of salvage, is a rightful subject of legislation, is not to be questioned. The jurisdiction then vested by the legislature in this municipal Court, must be sustained, unless inconsistent with the laws or Constitution of the United States. But with the Constitution, in legislating on the subject of salvage, there can be no incongruity; it is only therefore the supposed inconsistency, with the Act of Congress of May 1824, that can impugn it.\n The provisions of that Act upon this subject, are these:--\n'Each of the said Courts, (meaning the superior Courts of the district of Florida,) shall moreover have and exercise the same jurisdiction within its limits, in all cases arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States, which, by an Act to establish the judicial Courts of the United States, approved the 24th day of September 1789, and 'an Act in addition to the Act entitled an Act, to establish the judicial Courts of the United States, approved the 2d March 1793,' was vested in the Court of Kentucky district.'\n\n The question then is reduced to this, in what cases, arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States, is jurisdiction vested in the Court of Kentucky district, by the two Acts of the 24th September 1789, and the 2d of March 1793.\n It has been erroneously assumed, that all the jurisdiction vested by those Acts in the Kentucky Court, was vested by this law in the superior Court of Florida; it is expressly confined to cases arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States; and the reason is obvious. In all cases arising under the laws of the district, jurisdiction is given by the preceding section of the same Act; but as most of the laws of the United States, had been made of force in the territory as before observed, the 2d section is intended to extend the jurisdiction of the Court to cases arising under the latter laws, and further, if necessary, to all cases arising under laws of the United States, over which jurisdiction had been given to the Kentucky Court-a practice in defining jurisdiction, that had been pursued by Congress, with regard to all the territories subsequent to the time when the Kentucky Court was established. \n In the original organization of the judiciary of the United States, Kentucky and Maine were excluded from the arrangement of circuits. And, as no Circuit Court was required in law to be held there, the District Court was vested with Circuit Court jurisdiction.-This is the whole purport of the Act of 1789, referred to in the Florida Act of 1824. The other Act there referred to, to wit, that of 1793, has no other operation as to the Kentucky Court, besides vesting in it the power given to the Circuit Courts to hold special sessions.\n If the Florida Act were as broad in its operation as the two Acts referred to, it would indeed be a serious question, whether the legislature of Florida could divest its superior Court of any part of its admiralty jurisdiction, as existing in and exercised by the District Courts of the United States. But I think it incontestable, that the jurisdiction here given is explicitly restricted to so much of the jurisdiction of the Kentucky Court only, as comes within the description of cases arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States.\n Now, excepting in the single instance of the present Bank of the United States, Congress, never has vested a jurisdiction even in its Circuit Courts, generally, over causes arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. It has given an appellate jurisdiction, and that only to the Supreme Court, over causes of that description, when such causes arise in the state Courts, but we look in vain through the law defining the jurisdiction of the Kentucky Court for any general claim to jurisdiction under the description of 'cases arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States.'\n Yet, very ample operation must be given to these words of the Florida Act, considered in reference to the jurisdiction actually possessed and exercised by the Kentucky Court, under the two laws of 1789 and 1793. The land laws, revenue laws, laws of trade, criminal laws, and many other public laws, were all laws of the United States, under which, cases might arise, and over which the Kentucky Court, was undoubtedly vested with jurisdiction. Nor do I doubt, that the admiralty jurisdiction, over revenue cases, as exercised by the Kentucky Court, is rightfully vested, ( and that beyond the control of the Florida legislature,) in the Superior Court of this district.\n But here it appears to me, the grant of jurisdiction terminates. The admiralty jurisdiction, beyond this limit, is left to be administered under the laws of the territory, for this simple reason, that other causes, occurring in the admiralty, cannot be brought within this description of causes, arising under the laws of the United States-at least, this appears incontrovertible, when applied to questions of salvage arising on wreck of the sea-to questions of salvage on captures as prize of war, I am inclined to think it would extend, at least, to all causes, in which the distribution of prize money, depends upon laws of the United States.\n But it is argued, that this is a cause arising under the laws of the United States, within the reason of the decision of the Supreme Court, in the case of Osborne vs. The Bank of the United States; that the validity of the sale, divesting the interests of these libellants, depends upon the legality of the powers, exercised by the Court of Key West, \n which depends upon the powers vested in the legislature of Florida, which finally depends upon the Acts of Congress, which created the body politic of Florida-that creating a body politic, is only creating a body corporate on a larger scale, but essentially the exercise of one and the same power- that whether the one or the other sues or defends, legislates or acts, by itself or its agents, all must be done with reference to the law that creates and organizes it; and in fine, in the language of the Court, in the case cited, 'the charter, not only creates it, but gives it every faculty that it possesses. The power to acquire rights of any description, to transact business of any description, to sue on those contracts, is given and measured by its charter, and that charter is a law of the United States. This being, can acquire no right, make no contract, bring no suit, which is not authorized by a law of the United States It is not only itself the mere creature of the law, but all its actions, and all its rights, are dependent on the same law,' &c. I have taken a week to reflect upon this question alone, and I cannot withhold from the gentleman, who argued the cause for the libellants, an acknowledgment, that I have not been able to draw any line of discrimination, between this and the decided cause, which satisfies my mind. Yet, I am thoroughly persuaded, that the learned men who decided that cause, never contemplated that such an application would have been given of their decision. I am happy in the prospect that this cause will finally be disposed of elsewhere, not doubting, that the mental acumen of those who decided the other, will be found fully adequate to distinguish or reconcile the two cases, on grounds which have escaped my reflections. At present, I must content myself with observing, that it is too much to require of a Court, upon mere analogy, to sustain an argument, that not only proves too much, if it proves any thing, but which leads, in fact, to positive absurdity.\n It will be recollected, that it is not only in the territories that we find bodies politic created by the laws of the United States, but that near one half the states derive their origin and admission into the Union, under laws of the United States. But will it be contended that all the causes arising under their laws, are causes arising under laws of the United States? It is true, that in the District of Columbia, the appellate jurisdiction given to the Supreme Court, can be maintained only on the ground that the laws of that district are laws of the United States; and that all the laws of the District of Florida derive directly, or indirectly, their force from the same origin. \n But in the case of the District of Columbia, this power is expressly given to the Supreme Court, and we are not now inquiring whether Congress might not have vested this jurisdiction in the Superior Court of Florida, but whether they have so vested it. The simple inquiry is, what force and operation is to be given to those words, in the second section of the Act of 1824, 'Jurisdiction in all cases arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States?' And what could be more absurd than to decide, that the same force is to be given to those words as if they were not there. Expunge that sentence altogether, and the construction of the clause will be necessarily and precisely that contended for by the libellants, to wit, an unrestricted grant of the Jurisdiction vested by law in the Kentucky Court. It not unfrequently happens, that in the construction of a whole law, or a section, or a clause of a law, words, or even sentences, are declared surplusage, or irreconcilable with other words or sentences; but here we are called upon to give a meaning to words, which deprives them of all meaning, and that without any incongruity with other words, or want of distinct meaning in themselves, but from an analogy with another case, in which similar words have received a construction which produces that consequence, when applied to these words.\n Until better advised, I must maintain that these words have a definite meaning and bearing in their place in this law, and amount to a restriction of the jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Florida, to a class of cases which does not comprise salvage on wreck of the sea.\n\n Some minor grounds have been dwelt upon in argument, of which it is proper to take a brief notice.\n It has been argued that the Superior Court of Florida acquired jurisdiction in another way; to wit, that the 9th section of the Florida Act, of 1822, makes of force in the territory, all public laws of the United States, not repugnant to the provisions of that Act. That the judiciary Acts are Acts of that description, and, therefore, are laws of the territory. But this argument is without point, until such an organization of Circuit and District Courts of the United States takes place in that territory, as will admit of the application of this law to the jurisdiction of its Courts. Or rather, it takes effect as to the subject now under consideration, only through those clauses which relate to the jurisdiction of the Kentucky Court, and thus returns, in a circle, to the argument which we have been before considering.\n It has also been contended that the Florida Act, under which the Court at Key West was organized, is void. 1st. Because never ratified by Congress; and 2dly, because inconsistent with that provision of the first section of the Act of 1824, which gives original jurisdiction to the Superior Courts of the territory, in all cases of 100 dollars in value.\n To the first of these reasons, the 5th section of the Act of 1822, furnishes an unequivocal answer. It is only the right of repealing that Congress retains over the laws of Florida. That clause which requires the Governor to report the laws of the territory to the President, to be laid before Congress, is merely directory, but has no bearing upon the validity of those laws, until repealed. The words are 'which if disapproved by Congress, shall thenceforth be of no force;' necessarily implying their previous operation. \n\n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGOVERNOR OF GEORGIA v. MADRAZO(1828)\nNo. 80\nArgued: Decided: January 1, 1828\n\n\n THESE cases were brought before this Court, from the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of Georgia, under the following circumstances.\n The schooner Isabelita, a Spanish vessel, owned by Juan Madrazo, a native Spanish subject, domiciliated at Havana, was despatched by him with a cargo, his own property, in the year 1812, on a voyage to the coast of Africa, where she took in a cargo of slaves. On her return voyage she was captured by a cruiser called the Successor, under the piratical flag of Commodore Aury; the said cruiser being then commanded by one Moore, an American citizen; and having been fitted out in the port of Baltimore, and manned and armed in the river Severn, within the waters and jurisdiction of the United States. The Isabelita and the slaves on board, were carried to Fernandina, in Amelia Island, and there condemned by a pretended Court \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 111]\n\u00a0\n of Admiralty, exercising jurisdiction under Commodore Aury; and sold, under its authority, by the prize agent, Louis Segallis, to one William Bowen. The negroes, so purchased by Bowen, were conveyed into the Creek nation, in consequence, as it was alleged, of the disturbed state of East Florida, the insecurity of property there, and with a view to their settlement in West Florida; then a province of the Spanish monarchy. Being found within the limits of the state of Georgia, they were seized by an officer of the customs of the United States, and delivered to an agent appointed by the governor of Georgia, under the authority of the Act of the Legislature of that state, passed in conformity to the provisions of the Act of Congress of March 1807, prohibiting the importation of slaves into the United States; the negroes having been so brought into the United States, in violation of that Act.\n Some of the negroes were sold by an order of the governor, without any process of law, and the proceeds paid over to the treasurer of Georgia. The residue of the negroes are in possession of an agent, appointed by the governor of Georgia.\n The Isabelita was fitted out as a cruiser at Fernandina; taken by Moore to Georgetown, South Carolina; seized there by the United States, sent round to Charleston; libelled in the District Court of South Carolina; and, by a decree of that Court, restored to Madrazo, the claimant.\n The governor of Georgia filed an information in the District Court of the United States for the district of Georgia; praying that a part of these Africans, which remained specifically in his hands, might be declared forfeited, and may be sold.\n A claim was given in, in this case, by William Bowen; Juan Madrazo, the libellant in the other case, did not claim.\n The decree of the District Court dismissed the claim of William Bowen, and adjudged the negroes to be delivered to the governor of Georgia, to be disposed of according to law.\n William Bowen appealed to the Circuit Court, by which Court his claim was dismissed; and from the decree of that Court, dismissing his claim, he has not appealed. Juan Madrazo filed his libel in the District Court of Georgia, alleging, that a Spanish vessel called the Isabelita, having on board a cargo of negroes, was piratically captured on the high seas, carried into the port of Fernandian, there condemned by some pretended tribunal, and and sold;-that the negroes were conveyed, by the purchaser, into the Creek nation, where they were seized by an officer of the United States, and by him delivered to the government of the state of Georgia; pursuant to an Act of the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, carrying into effect an Act of Congress of the United States;-that \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 112]\n\u00a0\n a part of the said slaves were sold, as permitted by said Act of Congress, and as directed by said Act of the General Assembly of the said state, and the proceeds thereof deposited in the treasury of the said state;-that part of the said slaves remain undisposed of, under the control of the governor of the said state, or his agents; and prays restitution of said slaves and proceeds. Claims were given in by the governor of Georgia, and by William Bowen. The District Court dismissed the libel, and the claim of William Bowen. From this appeal, Juan Madrazo appealed to the Circuit Court.\n The Circuit Court dismissed the libel and claim of the governor of Georgia, and directed restitution to the libellant; and from this decree, appeals have been taken by the state of Georgia, and by William Bowen. A warrant of arrest was issued by the District Court, but was never served. A monition also issued, and was served, on the governor and treasurer of the state of Georgia.\n In the Circuit Court, the following proceedings took place:-'On motion of the proctors of the libellant, Madrazo, ordered, that he have leave to renew his warrant, for the property libelled; but it shall be held a sufficient execution of such warrant, if the governor, who appears as claimant, in behalf of the state, will sign an acknowledgment, that he holds the same subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.'\n Whereupon the following instrument was filed, December 24th, 1823:--\n Executive Department, Milledgeville, May 15th 1823.\n The executive having been furnished by the deputy marshal with the copy of an order, passed by the Circuit Court of the United States, in relation to certain Africans, the title to which is a matter of controversy in said Circuit Court, and also in the Superior Court of the county of Baldwin, makes the following statement and acknowledgment, in satisfaction of said order and notice.\n Juan Madrazo vs. Sundry Africans.\n Libel in admiralty, against sundry African negroes.\n The governor of the state of Georgia acknowledges to hold sundry African negroes, now levied on, by virtue of sundry executions, by the sheriff of Baldwin county, subject to the order of the Circuit Court of the United States, for the district of Georgia; after the claim of said sheriff, or prior thereto, if the claim in the said Circuit Court shall be adjudged to have priority of the proceeding in the state Court. JOHN CLARK, Governor. \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 113]\n\u00a0\n Documentary evidence was introduced in the Court below, and witnesses were examined, which proved the interest of Madrazo in the Isabelita; the illegality of the capture and condemnation; and which were intended to prove the identity of the negroes, the subject of the proceedings, with those who had been on board the Isabelita.\n On the part of Juan Madrazo, it was contended.--\n\n 1. \nThat his proprietary interest in the slaves, and the illegality of the capture, and condemnation of the Isabelita and cargo, were fully proved, and that he is entitled to restitution of the property libelled.\n\n 2. \nThat the Court below had jurisdiction.\n\n 3. \nThat the possession of the property libelled, the service of the monition, and the order of the Circuit Court, and agreement of the governor of Georgia, filed in that Court, fix the parties in possession of the property for it; and that the process of the Court will operate on them individually; and not on the state of Georgia.\n On the part of the state of Georgia, it was contended.--\n\n 1. \nThat the Court below had no jurisdiction.\n\n 2. \nThat there is no sufficient proof of proprietary interest, to entitle Juan Madrazo to restitution of the property libelled.\n William Bowen was not represented by counsel, before the Court.\n As the decision of the Court was exclusively on the question of jurisdiction, no other than the arguments of counsel on that question are given.\n Mr. Berrien, on the part of the state of Georgia.--\n\n 1. \nThe Circuit Court of the United States had no jurisdiction in the case, it involving jurisdiction over the state of Georgia.\n Jurisdiction cannot be claimed on the ground of consent; it cannot be obtained by the voluntary appearance of the governor of Georgia to the libel of Madrazo, and he had no right to give jurisdiction. The exemption of a state from the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States, is for the preservation of their sovereignty; it is an attribute of sovereignty, and it is no objection to the exception being taken, that the appearance was voluntary. The governor of Georgia could not yield up this attribute of the sovereignty of the state; his [113-Continued.]\nagency being limited by the Constitution. A party may object to the jurisdiction of the Court below, to try a cause which he himself instituted, Capron vs. Van Noorden, 2 Cranch, 126. This question is therefore to be considered as unaffected by the appearance of the governor of Georgia.\n The 11th article of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States, takes away the jurisdiction of the Courts of the Union, in all cases in law and equity, in which claims are \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 114]\n\u00a0\n preferred against the separate states; and the amendment was intended to leave to the several states the adjustment of the claims of individuals upon them; Cohens vs. State of Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264. The judicial power of the Courts of the United States, is, by the amendment, prevented from extending to any suit, commenced or prosecuted, &c., against a state. 6 Wheat. 264. 407, 408.\n The alteration in the Constitution was not made by revoking a power which the Courts possessed; but the amendment declares, that 'the judicial power shall not be construed to extend to suits, &c.;' and it denies that such a power ever existed.\n Why is not a suit in the admiralty a suit at law?\n It proceeds according to the law of the country, and in the Courts of the country. The laws which govern and regulate he decisions of the Admiralty Courts, are the laws of the Union.\n It is agreed, that, according to the doctrine in Fowler vs. Lindsey, 3 Dall. 411, the state must be either nominally, or substantially, a party to the suit. It is not enough, that the suit may, in its result, consequentially affect its interests.\n The state of Georgia is a party in the proceedings of Madrazo; a citation is prayed to the state; and the property which the libellant seeks to obtain, by the decree of the District Court, is in the possession of the governor of Georgia, under the authority of a law of the state; another part is in the treasury of Georgia, and has become mingled with the general and public funds of the state. The process of the Court was served on the governor and treasurer of the state; and they are required to show cause, why restitution shall not be decreed. The law of the United States of 1807, prohibits the importation of slaves; and directs, that if slaves are brought in, they shall be seized, and delivered to the governor of the state in which the seizure is made. The governor of Georgia appointed an agent to receive them; and the libel states the slaves claimed, were delivered to the agent of the state. The right of the state of Georgia, acquired under that Act, is spread on the record by the libellant; and it is this right, so acquired, which he seeks to divest. The state of Georgia is, therefore, a party to this suit, because the res is in her possession; and the monition issued below, was served upon the governor and the treasurer of the state.\n The jurisdiction is also denied, because a judgment of the Court would operate directly on the state of Georgia. Madrazo should look to the legislature of Georgia for redress; and the appeal to her justice, is not to be made through the Courts of the United States.\n The terms of the amendment to the Constitution-its spirit, \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 115]\n\u00a0\n and the views heretofore taken of it, by this Court, are all opposed to the construction now claimed, which will except from the operation of the amendment, cases of admiralty jurisdiction. Proceedings in the admiralty, are suits at law. Does the admiralty proceed without law, according to the will of the Judge? The forms of its proceedings are according to the Civil Law;-the rights of the parties are decided according to the law of nations, and the law merchant; and both on its prize and instance side, according to the municipal laws of the country where it sits.\n The objections made by the states to their liability, before the amendment to the Constitution, was not to the mode by which the suit was instituted; but to the fact of their being made answerable to the Courts of the Union.\n To restrict the amendment to cases of Common Law and Equity, would not, therefore, have afforded an adequate remedy to the alleged grievance. Nor was the restriction established with a reservation as to claims, by foreigners; neither was it intended to leave uninfluenced by it, cases which might arise out of a state of war. Many of the suits which had been brought, and which might have been brought, before the amendments, were instituted by foreigners; or were of a nature to be prosecuted in the admiralty. The construction claimed by the opposite counsel, would exhibit the extraordinary fact, that while the amendment took away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in suits against states, it left it in the lowest Court under the Constitution.\n Nor does the exemption of the states from suits in the admiralty, authorize apprehensions of internal difficulties. In cases of captures at war, on the high seas, by whatever ship of war or armed vessel, acting under the authority of the United States, the capture may be made, no right could be acquired by capture, to the property, by a state; the right to the property, is that of the sovereign who makes the war; and, but for the Prize Act, by which the property captured is condemned and distributed, it would remain the property of the sovereign. Cited, Osborne vs. The Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 157-8; likewise Cohens vs. The state of Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264.\n But if the amendment to the Constitution does not extend to cases of admiralty jurisdiction; the jurisdiction of this case would be in the Supreme Court, and therefore, there is error in these proceedings.\n\n 2. \nThe Court below, never had possession of the res, or any thing pertaining to it. The warrant of arrest issued in the District Court, was never served. The Court relying on the service of the monition, which was erroneous. \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 116]\n\u00a0\n The res remained in the possession of the governor of Georgia, without any agreement for its production.\n The proceedings in the District Court, not having been founded upon the res; and the service of the monition not having been legal; the Circuit Court could not have jurisdiction on the appeal. As an appellate Court, it could, by no proceeding, get possession of the res; and the case should have been remitted by the Circuit to the District Court.\n The provisions of the Act of Congress of 1807, which apply to this case, were not repealed by the law of 1818.\n The repeal applied to importations by sea, and these slaves were brought into Georgia by land.\n Mr. Wilde, for Juan Madrazo, made these points.--\n\n 1. \nThat the Court below had jurisdiction. 2. That the proprietary interest of Madrazo, in the Isabelita, and slaves, and the illegal outfit of the Successor, are sufficiently proved; and he is consequently entitled to restitution.\n The original grant of jurisdiction, in such cases, to the Court of the United States, ample. 2d sect., 3d art. Cons. U. S. The admiralty jurisdiction is, 'of all cases of admiralty, a maritime jurisdiction,' generally, without restriction; whether they arise under the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States, or the law of nations.\n The grant of common law and equity jurisdiction, is confined to cases arising under the constitutional laws and treaties of the Union. Before the amendent to the Constitution, the Courts of the United States must have taken cognizance of admiralty cases; although a state were directly interested, or even a party on the record.\n Even since the amendment, there are cases in which it is presumed these Courts may take jurisdiction, although a state be a party. The second clause of the tenth section of the second article of the Constitution, prohibits the states from keeping troops, or ships of war, only in time of peace. In time of war, they may. During actual hostilities, there is nothing to prevent a state from fitting out a ship of war, or even a fleet, for defence, or annoyance; and the lawful prizes made by such a fleet, it is presumed, would be the property of the state-a state may exercise this power. Congress have the right to make rules concerning captures. Such rules are the supreme law. But if all captures, made by state cruisers, are to be tried in state tribunals, how long could the rules of Congress concerning captures be enforced; or the belligerent rights of the Union be exerted, without the violation of justice to neutral nations? To the great powers of war and peace, must be attached \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 117]\n\u00a0\n those of making war efficient, and peace secure. Unjust judgments, unredressed, are among the causes of war. But if the state tribunals are to decide in the last resort, upon captures made by their own vessels, where neutral claimants are concerned; the whole may be involved in war, by the misconduct of a part.\n This Court will not adopt such a construction of the amendment, unless it is forced upon them, by its terms.\n The language must be clear, strong, and peremptory, which coerces its adoption.\n The grant distinguishes between common law and equity jurisdiction, and admiralty jurisdiction. They are given by distinct clauses, and to a different extent; and are treated as separate powers. If they are so considered-if the three are separately granted, distinguishing each from the other, and two only are taken away; does not the third remain?\n If the District Court were proceeding without jurisdiction, how has it happened, that a prohibition was not moved for? It would lie, in such a case. U. States vs. Peters. 3 Dall. 121; and an appeal might be taken on the decision. Cohen vs. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 397. The counsel referred to Publicus, No. 80, and to the debates of the conventions, on adopting the Constitution. But, supposing the amendment extends to, and excludes, admiralty, as well as equity and common law jurisdiction; is this a case, where the state is a party defendant on the record, or in which her rights are directly implicated; and the process of this Court must go against her? In form, the state is not a party-the information and claim, are by John Clark, Governor, in behalf, &c. The proceeding, if state interests are implicated, is not against a state, but by a state; the state, if a party at all, is the actor. In substance, it is a judicial proceeding, at the instance of a state; in which she seeks the aid of the United States' Courts, to give effect to a title claimed in her behalf, under the United States' Laws. In effect, the sentence and process of the Court, will operate not upon the state, but on individuals. Osborne vs. The Bank of the United States. 9 Wheat. 738, and the United States vs. Bright, 3 Am. Law Journal, 216.\n Has the state of Georgia really any interest in those Africans? The claim set up, is under the Act of Congress of 1807, prohibiting the slave trade; which places Africans illegally imported, at the disposition of the state into which they are brought; and the Act of Georgia of November 1817, ordering them to be sold, unless taken by the Colonization Society, and all expenses since capture and condemnation paid. Before any decree upon this information-before it was even filed, all that part of the Act of 1807, under which Georgia could derive any title, repealed. Act of 1818. Ing. Dig.- \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 118]\n\u00a0\n The title to property forfeited, or liable to forfeiture, is not divested, till it is libelled and condemned; and if there be an appeal, not until sentence of condemnation is rendered in the appellate tribunal. Yeaton vs. The United States. 5 Cr. 281-3.\n If the statute creating the forfeiture, be repealed before final sentence, without reserving the right to punish cases arising under it, condemnation cannot take place, Schooner Rachael vs. The United States, 6 Cra. 329. The Irresistible, 6 Wheat. 551.\n Until the condemnation, the state has no right to the Africans.\n After condemnation, indeed, the importer's title is divested, by relation, back to the act of forfeiture. But until condemnation, his title is not divested.\n The right of the state, depends upon the result of a judicial investigation; which, when a forfeiture is ascertained by final sentence, gives it relation back to the time of the act committed, the from that period divests the importer, and invests the state, with his title. But if pending the proceedings the Act is repealed, the judicial proceeding necessary to give effect to the claim of the state, can have but one result.\n That claim must be rejected.\n The proposition, that the Courts of the United States have not jurisdiction in such a case, then, comes to this;-an alleged right, in a state, though dependent upon the result of a judicial inquiry, may be set up, to preclude that inquiry, upon the result of which it depends. And that, even though the Court could look into the question, must determine that no right, in fact, exists.\n Under this Act, there was no authority to sell the Africans before condemnation; and the money, if in the treasury, is there by the unauthorized act of an individual, and in violation of the law.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.-- Some time in the year 1817, Juan Madrazo, a Spaniard, residing in the Island of Cuba, engaged in the slave trade, fitted out a vessel for the coast of Africa, which procured a cargo of Africans; and on its return, in the autumn of 1817, was captured by a privateer sail, under the flag of one of the governments of Spanish America, and carried into Amelia Island; where the vessel and cargo were condemned by a tribunal, established by Aury, the authority of which has not been acknowledged in this country. The Africans were purchased by William Bowen, and were conducted into the Creek nation; \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 119]\n\u00a0\n within the limits of the state of Georgia, where they were seized by M'Queen M'Intosh, a revenue officer, at Darien, in Georgia, early in January 1818, under the Act of 1807; which prohibits the importation or bringing into the United States, of any negro, mulatto, or person of colour. This Act annuls the title of the importer, or any person, claiming under him, to such negro, mulatto, or person of colour, and declares that such persons 'shall remain subject to any regulation, not contravening the provisions of this Act, which the legislatures of the several states or territories, at any time hereafter, may make for disposing of such negro, mulatto, or person of colour.'\n In December 1817, the legislature of Georgia passed an Act, which empowered the governor to appoint some fit and proper person to proceed to all such ports and places within this state, as have or may have, or may hereafter hold any negroes, mulattoes, or persons of colour, as have been, or may hereafter be seized or condemned under the above recited Act of Congress, and who may be subject to the control of this state; and the person so appointed shall have full power and authority to receive all such negroes, mulattoes, or persons of colour, and to convey the same to Milledgeville, and place them under the immediate control of the executive of this state.\n The second section authorizes the governor to sell such negroes, mulattoes, or persons of colour, in such manner as he may think most advantageous to the state.\n The third directs that they may be delivered up to the Colonization Society, on certain conditions therein expressed; provided the application be made before the sale.\n Under this Act, the Africans brought in by William Bowen, were delivered up to the governor of Georgia, who sold the greater number of them, and paid the proceeds, amounting to 38,000 dollars, into the treasury of the state. The Colonization Society applied for those remaining unsold, amounting to rather more than twenty, and offered to comply with the conditions prescribed in the Act of December 1817.\n In May, 1820, the governor of Georgia filed an information in the District Court of Georgia, stating the violation of the Act of Congress, that the Africans were placed under the immediate control of the executive of the state, where they awaited the decree of the Court. He states the application made on the part of the Colonization Society, with which he is desirous of complying, as soon as he shall be authorized to do so by the decree of the Court.\n In November 1820, William Bowen filed his claim to the said Africans, alleging that they were his property-that they \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 120]\n\u00a0\n had not been brought into the United States in violation of the Act of Congress; but were seized while passing through the Creek nation, on their way to West Florida.\n In February 1821, Juan Madrazo filed his libel, alleging that the Africans were his property-that on the return voyage from Africa, they were captured by the privateer Successor, commanded by an American, and fitted out in an American port-that the vessel and cargo were carried into Amelia Island, and condemned by an unauthorized tribunal; after which they were brought by the purchaser into the Creek nation, where they were seized by an officer of the United States-brought into the limits of the district of Georgia, and delivered over to the government of that state, in pursuance of an Act of the General Assembly, carrying into effect an Act of Congress, in that case made and provided. That a part of the slaves were sold, and the proceeds, amounting to 38,000 dollars, or more, paid into the treasury of the state; and that the residue, amounting to twenty- seven or thirty, remain under the control of the governor.\n The libel denies that the laws of the United States have been violated, and prays that admiralty process may issue to take possession of the slaves remaining under the control of the governor of Georgia; and that the governor and all others concerned, should be cited to show cause why the said slaves should not be restored to Juan Madrazo, and the proceeds of those which had been sold, paid over to him.\n Upon this libel a monition was issued to the governor of Georgia, who appeared and filed a claim on behalf of the state; in which he says, that the slaves were brought into the state, in violation of the Act of Congress, and that they were taken into the possession of the executive of the state, in pursuance of the Act of the state legislature, enacted to carry the Act of Congress into effect. That a number of the said slaves have been sold, and the proceeds paid into the treasury, where they have become a part of the funds of the state, not subject to his control, or to the control of the treasurer. That the residue of the said slaves, who remain unsold, have been demanded under the law, by the Colonization Society.\n Process was also issued against the Africans, but was not executed. The two causes came on together, and the District Court dismissed the claim of Bowen, and also admissed the libel of Madrazo, and directed that the slaves remaining unsold should be delivered by the marshal to the governor of the state, and that the proceeds of those sold, should remain in the treasury.\n Both Bowen and Madrazo appealed to the Circuit Court.\n At the hearing in the Circuit Court, the sentence, dismissing \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 121]\n\u00a0\n the claim of Bowen, was affirmed. That dismissing the libel of Madrazo was reversed, and a decree was made, that the slaves remaining unsold, should be delivered to him; on his giving security to transport them out of the United States-and farther, that the proceeds of those which were sold, should be paid to him. From this decree, the governor of Georgia and William Bowen have appealed to this Court.\n A question, preliminarily to the examination of the title to the Africans, which were the subject of these suits, and to the proceeds of those which were sold, has been made by the counsel for the state of Georgia. He contends, that this is essentially, and in form, a suit against the state of Georgia; and therefore was not cognizable in the District Court of the United States.\n The process which issued from the Court of Admiralty not having been executed, the res was never in possession of that Court. The libel of Madrazo therefore, was not a proceeding against the thing, but a proceeding against the person for the thing. This appeal carried the cause into the Circuit Court, as it existed in the District Court, when the decree was pronounced. It was a libel, demanding, personally, from the governor of Georgia, the Africans remaining unsold, and the proceeds of those that were sold, which proceeds had been paid into the treasury.\n Pending this appeal, the governor filed a paper in the nature of a stipulation, consenting to hold the Africans claimed by the libel of Madrazo, subject to the decree of the Circuit Court; if it should be determined that the claim in the Circuit Court had priority to sundry executions, levied on them by the sheriff of Baldwin county. Had this paper been filed in the District Court, it would have been a substitute for the Africans themselves, and would, according to the course of the admiralty, have enabled that Court to proceed in like manner as if its process had been served upon them. The libel would then have been in rem. Could this paper, when filed in the Circuit Court, produce the same effect on the cause?\n We think it could not.\n The paper in nature of a stipulation, is a mere substitute for the process of the Court; and cannot, we think, be resorted to, where the process itself could not be issued according to law. The process could not issue legally in this case, because it would be the exercise of original jurisdiction in admiralty; which the Circuit Court does not possess.\n This cause therefore remained in its character a libel against the person of the governor of Georgia, for the Africans in his possession as governor, and for the proceeds, in the treasury, of \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 122]\n\u00a0\n those which had been sold. Could the District Court exercise jurisdiction in such a cause?\n Previous to the adoption of the 11th amendment to the Constitution, it was determined that the judicial power of the United States, extended to a case in which a state was a party defendant. This principle was settled in the case of Chisholm vs. Georgia. 2 Dal. 419. In that case, the state appears to have been nominally a party on the record. In the case of Hollingsworth vs. Virginia, also, in 3 Dal. 378, the state was nominally a party on the record. In the case of Georgia vs. Brailsford, 2 Dal. 402, the bill was filed by his excellency Edward Telfair, Esq. Governor and Commander in Chief, in and over the state of Georgia, in behalf of the said state. No objection was made to the jurisdiction of the Court, and the case was considered as one in which the Supreme Court had original jurisdiction, because a state was a party. In the case of New York vs. Connecticut, 4 Dal. 3, both the states were nominally parties on the record. No question was raised in any of the cases respecting the style in which a state should sue or be sued; and the presumption is that the actions were admitted to be properly brought. In the case of Georgia vs. Brailsford, the action is not in the name of the state, but it is brought by its chief magistrate in behalf of the state. The bill itself avows, that the state is the actor, by its governor.\n There is, however, no case in which a state has been sued without making it nominally a defendant.\n Fowler et al. vs. Lindsey et al. 3 Dal. 411, was a case in which an attempt was made to restrain proceedings in a cause depending in a Circuit Court; on the allegation that a controversy respecting soil and jurisdiction of two states, had occurred in it.\n The Court determined that a state, not being a party on the record, nor directly interested, the Circuit Court ought to proceed in it. In the United States vs. Peters, the Court laid down the principle, that although the claims of a state may be ultimately affected by the decision of a cause, yet if the state be not necessarily a defendant, the Courts of the United States are bound to exercise jurisdiction.\n In the case of Osbourne vs. the Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738, this question was brought more directly before the Court. It was argued with equal zeal and talent, and decided on great deliberation. In that case, the auditor and treasurer of the state were defendants, and the title of the state itself to the subject in contest was asserted. In that case, the Court said, 'It may, we think, be laid down as a rule, which admits of no exception, that in all cases where jurisdiction depends on the party, it is the party named in the record.' The Court added, \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 123]\n\u00a0\n 'the state not being a party on the record, and the Court having jurisdiction over those who are parties on the record, the true question is not one of jurisdiction, but whether, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, the Court ought to make a decree against the defendants; whether they are to be considered as having a real interest, or as being only nominal parties.'\n The information of the governor of Georgia professes to be filed on behalf of the state, and is in the language of the bill, filed by the governor of Georgia on behalf of the state, against Brailsford.\n If, therefore, the state was properly considered as a party in that case, it may be considered as a party in this.\n The libel of Madrazo, alleges that the slaves which he claims, 'were delivered over to the government of the state of Georgia, pursuant to an Act of the General Assembly of the said state, carrying into effect an Act of Congress of the United States, in that case made and provided; a part of the said slaves sold, as permitted by said Act of Congress, and as directed by an Act of the General Assembly of the said state; and the proceeds paid into the treasury of the said state, amounting to thirty- eight thousand dollars, or more.'\n The governor appears, and files a claim on behalf of the state, to the slaves remaining unsold, and to the proceeds of those which are sold. He states the slaves to be in possession of the executive, under the Act of the Legislature of Georgia, made to give effect to the Act of Congress on the subject of negroes, mulattoes or people of colour, brought illegally into the United State; and the proceeds of those unsold to have been paid in the treasury, and to be no longer under his control.\n The case made, in both the libel and claim, exhibits a demand for money actually in the treasury of the state, mixed up with its general funds, and for slaves in possession of the government. It is not alleged, nor is it the fact, that this money has been brought into the treasury, or these Africans into the possession of the executive, by any violation of an Act of Congress. The possession has been acquired, by means which it was lawful to employ.\n The claim upon the governor, is as a governor; he is sued, not by his name, but by his title. The demand made upon him, is not made personally, but officially. The decree is pronounced not against the person, but the officer, and appeared to have been pronounced against the successor of the original defendant; as the appeal bond was executed by a different governor from him who filed the information. In such a case, where the chief magistrate of a state is sued, not by his name, but by his style of office, and the claim made upon him is entirely in his official character, we think the \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 124]\n\u00a0\n state itself may be considered as a party on the record. If the state is not a party, there is no party against whom a decree can be made. No person in his natural capacity is brought before the Court as defendant. This not being a proceeding against the thing, but against the person, a person capable of appearing as defendant, against whom a decree can be pronounced, must be a party to the cause before a decree can be regularly pronounced.\n But were it to be admitted, that the governor could be considered as a defendant in his personal character, no case is made which justifies a decree against him personally. He has acted in obedience to a law of the state, made for the purpose of giving effect to an Act of Congress; and has done nothing in violation of any law of the United States.\n The decree is not to be considered as made in a case in which the governor was a defendant, in his personal character; nor could a decree against him, in that character, be supported.\n The decree cannot be sustained as against the state, because, if the 11th amendment to the Constitution, does not extend to proceedings in admiralty, it was a case for the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. It cannot be sustained as a suit, prosecuted not against the state but against the thing; because the thing was not in possession of the District Court.\n We are therefore of opinion, that there is error in so much of the decree of the Circuit Court, as directs that the said slaves libelled by Juan Madrazo, and the issue of the females now in the custody of the government of the state of Georgia, or the agent or agents of the said state, be restored to the said Madrazo, as the legal proprietor thereof, and that the proceeds of those slaves, who were sold by order of the governor or the said state, be paid to the said Juan Madrazo; and that the same ought to be reversed; but that there is no error in so much of the said decree as dismisses the information of the governor of Georgia, and the claim of William Bowen.\n\n Mr. Justice JOHNSON, dissentiente.--\n By the new and unexpected aspect which this cause has assumed, in this Court, I feel myself called upon to accompany the report of this decision with a brief explanation. Such an explanation appears necessary, not less in vindication of the course pursued by the state of Georgia, than of the judicial course of the Circuit Court, over which I have the honour to preside.\n By the state of facts, as now exhibited, it would appear as if the Court of the sixth circuit of the district of Georgia, had been taking very undue liberties, both with the executive and treasury departments of that state; and that two of the \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 125]\n\u00a0\n governors of that state, acting in behalf of the state, had first come voluntarily into the Courts of the United States, and then, only because the decision of that Court was against the rights they asserted, repudiated their own act, and denied the jurisdiction of the very Court which they had voluntarily called to decide on their rights.\n Yet nothing can be farther from the truth of the case. The real exposition of the incidents to the cause, lies in this;-that the actual promovent contestatio litis, was the colonizing society;-that Georgia, at least, in its inception, had no interest in it;-that the governor only regarded himself as a stake holder, to the three disputants who claimed the property. The slaves, as well as the proceeds of those which were sold, it is notorious, have, in fact, been delivered up by the state to one of these claimants.\n It is true, that in this point, the legislature of the state has differed in opinion on the question of right, from the Court that tried the cause, and surrendered them to Bowen, instead of Madrazo; but this fact proves, that she was not contending for herself.\n There is no necessity, however, for speaking out of the record on this subject. The information, as well as the claim, filed to Madrazo's libel, both explicitly avow, that, as to the slaves remaining unsold, the governor was acting in behalf of the colonizing society; and had not the decision below been against their claim, and on grounds which cannot be shaken, it is fair to conjecture, that the exception here taken to the jurisdiction, would never have been suggested; nor had that society possessed a legal existence, so as to prosecute a suit, in its own name, is there the least reason to believe, that the governor of Georgia would ever have presented himself, in the Courts of the United States, upon this subject.\n What could he do? This property had come legally into the hands of his predecessor-a part had been sold-and the rest transmitted to him, specifically. Two parties presented themselves, claiming it in their respective rights; and having been constituted by law, the guardian of the rights of one; he presents himself to the only Court that could take cognizance of the cause, in order to have the question of right decided, before he would surrender the slaves, in his possession, to either claimant. The money raised from the sales, he disavows having any control over.\n But, in the progress of the cause, incidents occur which produce a total change in the views and interests of parties. A third party arises, and, on the clearest proofs and best established principles, has made out the proprietary interest to be in himself. An appeal is taken to this Court; and pending the \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 126]\n\u00a0\n appeal, the party who had failed in every Court below, and must fail, wherever the rights are subjected to judicial cognizance, succeeds in prevailing on the legislature to abandon the property to him.\n Thus, then, the colonizing society have lost all hopes from a suit at law; Bowen has obtained the property; the legislature that gave it to him, can, at least, feel no desire to have Madrazo's rights confirmed in this Court; and all became interested in overturning their own work, and crushing Madrazo's interest under the ruins.\n It is certainly a purpose which cannot be willingly favoured in a Court of justice; and I meet it, with the most thorough conviction that the law is not with the appellants, on the objections to the jurisdiction of the Court below, which have now, here, for the first time, been moved and argued.\n There are two exceptions taken to the exercise of jurisdiction, in the Court below:--\n\n 1. \nThat a state was a party, &c.\n\n 2. \nThat the jurisdiction of the District Court never attached, because the res subjecta, was never actually in possession of that Court.\n The facts were these,-the negroes were certainly brought into the United States, in contravention of the Act of Congress of 1807. That Act creates a forfeiture, inasmuch as it divests the owner of all property in the slaves so brought in; and by another provision, it is left to the states to dispose of such persons of colour, in any manner they may think proper, not contravening the provisions of that Act. The state of Georgia, by law, authorized their governor to appoint an agent to receive such persons of colour, and deliver them to the executive, to be sold, unless applied for, by the colonizing society; and if so applied for, then to be delivered into their possession.\n These slaves were seized by a revenue officer of the United States, and voluntarily delivered to governor Rabun, then governor of Georgia; who had sold all, except about thirty, before the society applied to him, agreeably to the provisions of the Act.\n The Georgia law contains no express instructions to the governor, how to dispose of the proceeds of the sales. It authorizes him to sell, after sixty days notice, 'in such manner as he may think best calculated for the interest of the state;' but whether for cash, or credit, or to remain in, or be shipped from, the state, be meant by this provision, there are no means of determining. The money was, in this instance, paid into the treasury; or, at least, so the governor alleges, in his claim \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 127]\n\u00a0\n to the Madrazo libel; and so we are bound to consider the facts.\n Here, then, was a case of forfeiture, under a law of Congress; and the governor of the state legally authorized to sue for, and recover, the thing forfeited, and 'when seized and condemned,' as the Georgia law expresses it, to sell it on one state of facts; on another, to deliver it to the colonizing society. Who was to sue for this forfeiture; if not the state, or the governor, as its representative? The society could not, for it had no existence in law.\n The governor accordingly sold the greater part; and his successor filed an information in the District Court of the United States, to have the residue condemned, that he might deliver them to that society. To this libel and information, Bowen filed his claim and answer; and, while that suit was pending, Madrazo filed his libel in the District Court, praying process against the Africans remaining in the governor's hands, and the proceeds of those which were sold. On this libel a werrant of arrest was issued against the slaves, and a monition to the governor and all concerned, in relation to the whole subject of Madrazo's claim.\n The warrant of arrest was not served in the District Court; but governor Clarke, successor of governor Rabun, appeared to the monition, without protest, and filed a claim to the Africans, in behalf of the society; as to the proceeds of those which had been sold, he simply answers, that they had been paid into the treasury, where they remained mixed up with the treasure of the state, and beyond his control.\n The pleadings were in this state, when the district Judge entered upon a plenary hearing of the case, taking into view the information of the governor with Bowen's claim, and the libel of Madrazo with the governor's claim and answer; and thereupon sustained the information, and dismissed Bowen's claim and Madrazo's libel.\n Bowen and Madrazo appealed; and, on the hearing in the Circuit Court, where a body of new evidence was introduced; the decree of the District Court was reversed, and the information and Bowen's claim dismissed.\n But having proceeded so far, the Circuit Court found itself thus situated.\n As the District Court had sustained the information, it would have been nugatory to enforce its warrant of arrest upon the slaves, since they were already in possession of the state. Madrazo's libel being dismissed in that Court, no further steps were taken, to render the res subjecta, into actual possession.\n But, when the information was dismissed, and Madrazo's \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 128]\n\u00a0\n libel sustained in the Circuit Court, it followed, that it was error in the District Court, not to have enforced the service of the warrant of arrest on the slaves, or done some equivalent act. Thus situated, the Circuit Court could not send back the cause; because, by the 24th section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the Circuit Court is required to go on and make such decree, as this District Court ought to have made. That Court thought that the obligation to perform this duty, carried with it all the incidents necessary to perform it, and ordered process accordingly. To this, the governor again, without protest, responded, by voluntarily entering into a stipulation to hold the slaves, subject to the order of that Court; and then the Court, considering itself legally in possession of the res, made the decree in favour of Madrazo, which is here brought up for revision.\n On the question of right, upon the evidence before the Circuit Court, there can scarcely be two opinions. The cargo was Madrazo's-it was captured by a privateer-fitted out in Baltimore-run into Fernandina-there sold to Bowen-carried across the country to the Creek agency, within the limits of the United States, and where its jurisdiction attached, notwithstanding the Indian title existed-and, although Bowen, the tortiou sowner, committed an offence by introducing them into the country; Madrazo was not privy to that offence, and was innocent of any act that could work a forfeiture of his interest.\n But the question now to be considered, is exclusively that of jurisdiction; and it is insisted, first, that as the state was a party, and the party defendant in both cases, in the Circuit Court, that Court could not maintain jurisdiction of the subject.\n That a state is not now suable by an individual, is a question on which the Court below could not have paused a moment.\n The 11th amendment to the Constitution, put that question at rest for ever. But where is the provision of the Constitution, which disables a state from suing in the Courts of the Union?\n The second section of the third article, extends the judicial power of the United States, to all cases arising under the Law of the United States, and to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies between two or more states, between a state and citizens of another state-and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens, or subjects.\n It is true, the next section provides, that, in all cases in which a state shall be a party, the Supreme Court shall have \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 129]\n\u00a0\n original jurisdiction. But, it is obvious, that original, does not mean exclusive; and, in the 13th section of the Judicial Act, of 1789, it is so treated; since the legislature there declares, in what instances the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court shall be exclusive, and in what concurrent, when a state is a party. The words of that section are: 'The Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies of a civil nature, where a state is a party, except between a state and its citizens; and except also between a state, and citizens of other states, and aliens; in which latter case, it shall have original, but not exclusive jurisdiction.'\n Now, considering this section in connexion with the Constitution, it is obvious, that the word exclusive, there used, must be considered as applying solely to the Courts of the United States; since it never could have been imagined, that the states were to be restricted from suing in their own Courts, or those of their sister states; and thus construed, it must carry the implication, that the states may sue in any other Courts of the United States, in cases comprised within the jurisdiction vested in those Courts, by the Judiciary Act; provided, the cause of action, or the parties, be such as bring the suit within the cases to which the judicial power of the United States is extended, by the Constitution.\n In a suit against an alien, then, there can be no question, that a state may sue in the Circuit Court; and must prosecute a suit there, if the alien chooses to assert the right of transfer secured to him, under the 12th section of that Act.\n And so, with regard to suits against consuls, and vice-consuls, it is perfectly clear, that the suit of a state must, if the defendant insists upon his right, be prosecuted in the District Courts of the United States.\n The 9th section of the Act, being that which prescribes the jurisdiction of the District Courts, is explicit on this point. But that section embraces other cases, in which, without any strained construction, the states may assert the rights of a suitor, in the District Court.\n The words of the section are: 'The District Courts shall have exclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, including all seizures under Laws of Impost, Navigation, and Trade of the United States, where seizures are made on waters, &c.; and shall also have exclusive original cognizance of all seizures on land, &c.; and of all suits for penalties, and forfeitures, incurred under the Laws of the United States.'\n Now, it is very clear, that wherever the District Court is vested with 'exclusive original cognizance,' the Supreme Court can possess no original jurisdiction; and such is clearly the case, \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 130]\n\u00a0\n with regard to seizures, and suits for forfeitures, under the Laws of the United States, and suits in the admiralty. And, unless some reason can be shown, why a state should not prosecute a suit for a forfeiture, under the Laws of the United States; it follows, with regard to the information, that the jurisdiction was rightfully exercised by the District Court, in the present instance. The admiralty suit shall be separately considered. But why may not a state prosecute a suit for a forfeiture, under a law of the United States? Take the cases of a law of Congress passed to aid the states, in the collection of a tonnage duty; or of a penalty, under their inspection laws. In the one case, there may be a seizure on the water, and in the other, on the land: in either, there may be a suit for a forfeiture; and in all, the penalty, might, very rationally, be given to the state, or its prosecuting officer. The present, so far as it involves the question on the information, is precisely one of those cases. Here was a forfeiture, incurred under a law of the United States; and the benefit of it, was consigned to the states, if they chose to accept it. Here the state did accept it, and authorized their executive to assert the rights derived under the Law of Congress.\n An examination of the exceptions in the thirteenth section of the Act, which marks out the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, will throw light upon this subject.\n The language of the section is: 'That the Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies of a civil nature, where a state is a party, except between a state and its citizens; and except also, between a state and citizens of other states, or aliens; in which latter case, it shall have original, but not exclusive jurisdiction.'\n Now, it may seem unaccountable, at first view why these exceptions should have been extended to controversies between a state and its own citizens; since controversies between a state and its own citizens, is not one of the subjects of jurisdiction enumerated in the Constitution. And the solution is to be found in this, that the grant of jurisdiction, as to cases arising under the Constitution, Laws, &c. of the United States, and of admiralty and maritime causes, is not restricted to, or limited by any relation, or description of persons. Controversies, in these branches of jurisdiction, may, therefore, by possibility, arise between a state and its own citizens; certainly between a state and the citizens of other states, or aliens, under the laws of the Union, or in admiralty and maritime cases.\n As the law regards this information as a civil suit, in rem, on the exchequer side of the admiralty, and it was grounded on a law of Congress- the citizenship of the claimants, can have no influence on the question of jurisdiction. I think, \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 131]\n\u00a0\n however, that it appears somewhere in this voluminous record, that Bowen was a citizen of Georgia; but whether of that state, a sister state, or a foreign state, the controversy, if it be regarded as one with individuals, is expressly excepted from the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court; and, I must think, is within the original jurisdiction of the District Court. And if so, it follows, that the state must, upon appeal from a decision there made in its favour, assume the attitude of a defendant in any Court, into which the cause may be legally carried, by appeal or writ of error.\n In England, the king cannot be sued, yet he is daily brought before the Appellate Courts, as a defendant in error. It has long since been decided that this is legal. And thus, too, the United States Continually appears upon the docket of this Court, as a party defendant; and, for the same reason, although not suable originally, yet upon a judgment obtained, injunctions have been granted against parties who could not otherwise have been made defendants: as, for example, the United States.\n The thing is unavoidable-it is incident to the right of appeal. Justice could not be administered without it. There would be no reciprocity-the law would operate unequally, and to the prejudice of the citizen.\n There is no compulsory process used to produce this reversed, I may say, nominal, state of parties. The cause is removed by a citation, or other less offensive process, and the party appears in the Superior Court, if he will-if not, the cause is disposed of without an appearance.\n So much for the information, and the appeal from the District Court upon it. We will now consider the rights of the state, in the relation in which it stood to Madrazo's libel. I am considering the state, and not the officers of the state, as the real party to the record.\n When Madrazo's libel was filed, the governor's information was pending; and as Madrazo's libel sets out the seizure and delivery of the slaves to the executive of Georgia, and the claims advanced to the proprietary interest therein; it was properly considered in the District Court, in connexion with the information, and in the double aspect of a claim and libel. In the case of the Antelope, the cross libel of the Portuguese was treated, reciprocally, as claim and libel. Considered in the relation of a claim to the information, it is impossible to deny, that if the state rightly preferred the information, it must have been bound by the decisions, both of the District Court, and of the tribunal to which an appeal lay from the decision of the District Court upon that information, as regarded the rights of the claimants. \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 132]\n\u00a0\n And if we consider Madrazo's libel in the aspect of a suit in the admiralty, it appears to me impossible to assign a sufficient reason why the state should not be equally bound.\n The property or possession of the state had been acquired under a capture at sea-a maritime tort. It was therefore clearly a case of admiralty jurisdiction. Where then is the limit to this branch of the jurisdiction of the District Court? No personal relation, description, or character, imposes any such limit. The grant of jurisdiction to the United States, and by the United States to the District Court, is without restriction-and it would be singular, if a state should be precluded from the right of appearing to assert its rights before that tribunal. Suppose the case of a capture of a library shipped to state, and a re-capture and libel for salvage; surely, in some form or other, the state must have a hearing. There is nothing compulsory upon the state-the right may be abandoned, if it will; but, after preferring a claim, will it be contended, that it may withdraw itself from the contest, under an assertion of state immunities, to the prejudice of individual right? This is not a new question in the admiralty-it is considered by Godolphin, who observes 'that for the same party in the same cause to surmise and move for a prohibition against that jurisdiction, to which himself had formerly submitted, and in a cause which, by the libel, appears not other than maritime, seems quite beside the rule and practice of the law.' (Jurisd. of the Adm. p. 116, 117,) and the two adjudged cases of Jennings and Audley, (Brow. Rep. p. 2. p. 30,) and Baxter and Hopes, (Ibid.) which he cites, do fully establish 'that in all cases where the defendant admits the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Court, by pleading, then prohibition shall not be granted, if it do not appear that the act was done out of the jurisdiction.'\n Now, in this case, the state appeared, and claimed to the monition, without protest. In the admiralty a claimant is an actor-and had the decision of the District Court been affirmed, the state would have had the full benefit of this interposition, as a party. And again, at a subsequent period, the state voluntarily surrendered the res to the Circuit Court, and took it out again on stipulation, &c., and had not this exception now been taken, would have had all the benefit of a decree of restoration, if made by this Court. But it is insisted that consent cannot give jurisdiction-that this is a sound rule, and as applied to the Common Law Courts, cannot be controverted. But is it so in the admiralty?\n It must be recollected, that the Common Law Courts have themselves released this rule, in relation to the admiralty. I allude to the controversy on the subject of the stipulation bonds, which was finally abandoned, on the ground of the assent \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 133]\n\u00a0\n of the party, stipulating to submit to the jurisdiction of that Court. These decisions seem fully in point, to the present case. (2 Br. C. & A. 97, 98.)\n But in the proceedings, in rem, the admiralty wants no consent or concession to enlarge its jurisdiction. All the world are parties to such a suit, and bound by it, by the common consent of the world. The interest of a state, or the United States, in the res subjecta, must be affected by such a decision. The question will now be considered, whether the want of an actual reduction of the res into possession in the District Court, deprived that Court of jurisdiction; or whether if it did, that circumstance would affect the appellate jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. Also, whether on the reduction of the res into possession, there was any assumption of original jurisdiction in the Circuit Court?\n On these points I cannot bring myself to feel a doubt, since the very failure in the District Court to grant process for reducing the res into possession, would be such a 'damnum irreparabile' as would sustain an appeal to the Circuit Court. Otherwise, the very ground of appeal-that which gives jurisdiction, would take it away. And what, upon an appeal, would be the course of the Circuit Court, upon such a case? It has no power to remand the cause; for the 24th section requires, that 'when a judgment or decree shall be reversed in a Circuit Court, such Court shall proceed to render such judgment, or pass such decree, as the District Court should have rendered or passed.' This section, I must believe, necessarily, substitutes the Circuit for the District Court, upon a reversal; and vests it with power to do whatever that Court could have done, or ought to have done, originally. It is very important here to notice, that not reducing the res into possession in the District Court, was the necessary consequence of its first error, in sustaining the information, and dismissing Madrazo's libel. For if Madrazo's pretensions were to be considered as rejected, there could be no reason for pursuing the means of reducing the res into possession in the District Court-and while the cause was in the Circuit Court, that necessity did not arise, for the same reason, until the decree was passed for reversing the decree of the District Court, and dismissing the information. Thus circumstanced, the power given, and duty imposed, by the 24th section, could not have been exercised otherwise than it was. The Circuit Court, alone, could proceed to do justice between the parties, and become quo ad hoc, vested with original powers.\n The question, as it regards the proceeds of the Africans sold, is one of more nicety. For the proprietary interest in the negroes unsold, could well be disposed of, after the Court \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 134]\n\u00a0\n became actually possessed of them. The Court was not at liberty to doubt, that the stipulation would have returned the slaves, specifically, upon monition. But the proceeds of those sold, we must suppose had been paid into the treasury; and there is no doubt, that the Court could not, and would not, have attempted, by compulsory process, to get at it. Yet, was this a sufficient reason for not proceeding to adjudicate upon the question of right? I think not.\n It must be noticed here, that the head of the government had omitted no firm or legal means, to give authenticity to the submission of the state to the jurisdiction of the Court. The letters of procuration, executed by both governor Clarke, and his successor, governor Troup, in due from, are on the files; expressly authorizing, in the name of the state, all the acts of certain proctors of that Court, in the name and behalf of the state.\n The governor's answer, then, was the answer of the state; and when the answer avows, that many of the slaves were sold, and the money paid into the treasury, what is it, but acknowledging that the property of Madrazo no longer remains in specific existence, but has been sold, and appropriated by the respondent under such circumstances as convert Madrazo's rights into a pecuniary demand, a debt due by the state? Now, the state could stand in no other relation to Madrazo, in this behalf, than Bowen or the captor would have stood, had the sale been made by them; and can it be supposed, that a similar answer, from either Bowen or the captor, would have deprived the Court below of its jurisdiction?\n It is almost a work of supererogation, to resort to precedents on such a question; but if necessary, there is no want of precedents, to prove, that the District Court was bound to go on, and render justice to the libellant, according to the forms of the admiralty, as far as it could proceed.\n The case of Monro vs. Almedia, decided in this Court in 1825, was just such a case, (10 Wheat. 473.) There it was fully considered, whether the Court might go on, and how to proceed, and the cause was remanded to the Circuit Court, for further proceedings. The libel charged a seizure and appropriation of a sum of money, on the ocean; and the respondent appeared, under protest, and, by demurring, admitted as true, what the answer here avows to be true.\n And strongly analogous is the case of M'Kenzie vs. Livingston & Welsh, reported in a note to the 3d Term Rep. 333, in the case of Stuart vs. Wolf; in which M'Kenzie preferred a libel in the Vice-Admiralty Court, in Jamaica, to obtain condemnation of a sum of money, captured by him, and not paid into the registry of the Court. Livingston and Welsh filed a claim, and that Court decreed to them 'the sum of 1300 pounds, \n\n[26 U.S. 110, 135]\n\u00a0\n in the possession of the captor. M'Kenzie appealed to the Lords Commissioners, who affirmed the decree below, and the cause was remitted for further proceedings.\n In that case, the res was avowedly out of possession of the Court; and yet, upon the submission of the party who held it, the Court entertained jurisdiction, and decreed upon the cause; as if the claimant had been libellant, and the libellant stood in his place.\n When money is the thing in contest, or the thing captured has been converted into money, it becomes essentially a debt; and, of course, a metaphysical thing-not to be arrested specifically.\n Upon this view of the subject, the District Court might have exercised jurisdiction over the whole capture; and did entertain jurisdiction, in the very act of dismissing the libel, upon the question of right. Then, when the whole cause was brought, by appeal, before the Circuit Court, I hold that the Circuit Court was bound to go as far as it could go, without intrenching upon the sovereign rights of the state; which, for the purposes of justice, had thus consented to enter into the litigation between these parties;-that is, as far as a decree.\n Had not the progress of the Court been arrested by this appeal, it could certainly have gone no farther than to issue its monition. But, it cannot be doubted, that, upon Madrazo's petitioning the legislature on the subject, their officers would have been instructed to dispose of the property and money, according to the decree of the Court. Subsequent events, however, have given a new aspect to things; and Madrazo, with abundant proofs of his rights, is left without remedy.\n Decree.-These causes came on, &c., on consideration whereof. This Court is of opinion, that there is error in so much of the decree of the said Circuit Court, as directs restitution of the slaves libelled by Juan Madrazo, and the issue of the females, in the custody of the government of the state of Georgia, or the agent, or agents, of the said state, and that the proceeds of those slaves, who were sold by order of the government of the said state, be paid to the said Juan Madrazo; the Circuit Court not having jurisdiction of a cause, in which the plaintiff asserts a claim upon the state; and that the same ought to be reversed and annulled; and the libel of the said Juan Madrazo is ordered to be dismissed. And this Court is further of opinion, that there is no error in the residue of the said decree, and the same is hereby affirmed; and it is further considered and ordered, that the said cause be remanded to the said Circuit Court, with directions for further proceedings, to be had thereon, according to law and justice, in conformity to this opinion. \n\n\n\n"}}
