DEVEAUX(1809)\n\nArgued: Decided: February 1, 1809\n\n\n ERROR to the circuit court for the district of Georgia.\n The declaration, or petition, as it is there called, was as follows:\n District of Georgia.\n To the honourable the judges of the sixth circuit \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 62]\n\u00a0\n court of the United States, in and for the district aforesaid.\n The petition of The President, Directors and Company, of the Bank of the United States, which said bank was established under an act of congress entitled 'An act to incorporate the subscribers to the Bank of the United States,' passed the 25th day of February, 1791, showeth,\n That Peter Deveaux and Thomas Robertson, both of the city of Savannah, Esquires, have endamaged your petitioners in the sum of three thousand dollars for this, to wit, that the said Thomas Robertson, then acting under authority from the said Peter Deveaux, on the 20th day of April, 1807, at Savannah, in the district aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, with force and arms entered into the house and premises of your petitioners, at Savannah aforesaid, and then and there seized, took, and detained, two boxes (the goods and chattels of your petitioners) containing each one thousand dollars in silver, then and there found in the possession of your petitioners, and being of the value of two thousand and four dollars, and carried the same away, and converted and disposed thereof to their own use, and other wrongs to your petitioners then and there did against the peace of the district, and to the great damage of your petitioners, therefore your petitioners say they are injured, and have sustained damage to the value of three thousand dollars, and therefore they bring suit. Any your petitioners aver that they are citizens of the State of Pennsylvania, and the said Peter Deveaux and Thomas Robertson are citizens of the State of Georgia. Wherefore your petitioners pray process, &c.\n And the said Peter and Thomas, by R. L. their attorney, come and defend the force and injury, when, &c. and pray judgment of the declaration aforesaid, because they say that the sixth circuit court of the United States ought not to have and \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 63]\n\u00a0\n entertain jurisdiction of the said declaration, and the matters therein contained, for that the said president, directors and company of the bank of the United States aver themselves to be a body politic and corporate, and that in that capacity these defendants say they cannot sue or be sued, plead or be impleaded in this honourable court, by any thing contained in the constitution or laws of the same United States, and this they are ready to verify; wherefore, for want of jurisdiction in this behalf, they pray judgment, and their costs, &c.\n To this plea there was a demurrer and joinder, and judgment in favour of the defendants upon the demurrer.\n Binney, for the plaintiffs in error.\n In the year 1805 the State of Georgia passed a law to tax the Branch Bank of the United States, at Savannah. The bank having refused to pay the tax, the state officers entered their office of discount and deposit, and took and carried away two thousand dollars, for which the bank of the United States brought their action of trespass in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Georgia. The plea to the jurisdiction does not deny that the plaintiffs were citizens of the State of Pennsylvania, but relies upon the fact that the plaintiffs sue as a body corporate.\n The record presents two questions.\n\n 1. \nWhether a body politic, composed exclusively of citizens of one state, can sue a citizen of another state in the circuit court of the United States.\n\n 2. \nWhether the bank of the United States has not a peculiar right to sue in that court.\n The objections to this right are two.\n\n 1. \nThat the individual character of the members \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 64]\n\u00a0\n is so wholly lost in that of the corporation, that the court cannot take notice of it.\n\n 2. \nThat the suit being in a corporate capacity, it is impossible by the pleadings to bring into question the fact of citizenship of the individual members.\n The answer to the first objection embraces three propositions.\n\n 1. \nThat in many instances, the character, situation and attributes of the members of a corporation, are brought into notice in judicial proceedings against the corporate body.\n\n 2. \nThat even if it were otherwise, still the spirit of the federal constitution and laws demands, that the citizenship of the members should be noticed, as well to affect the question of jurisdiction, as for other purposes.\n\n 3. \nThat the constant practice in the circuit courts, and the tacit approbation of this court, have sanctioned their jurisdiction in such cases.\n\n 1. \nWhat is a corporation aggregate? It is a collection of many individuals united into one body, under a special name, having perpetual succession under an artificial form, and vested, by the policy of the law, with the capacity of acting in several respects as an individual. 1 Kyd. on Corp. 13. To say that it is an 'ens civile, a jus habendi et agendi, an ens rationis, a mere metaphysical being, and that it rests only in consideration and intendment of law,' are terms calculated to mislead the understanding.\n A corporation is composed of natural persons; it is a visible, tangible body; and although the whole collectively have faculties in law which the individuals have not, yet it does not follow that the whole body may not be seen, examined, sifted, and contemplated, as any other body of individuals having \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 65]\n\u00a0\n collectively a particular faculty. 11 Co. 98. b. The individuals hold their rights as members in their natural, and not in a politic capacity. A corporation is a mere collection of men having collectively certain faculties.\n When the president, directors and company of a bank are assembled, the corporation is visible. If all the members should die, or surrender their charter to the king, the corporation would be extinct. A corporation must exist by means of natural persons; and the law will examine whether the natural persons claiming to be members have all the necessary qualifications according to their charter. If any individual member does not possess them, he is to be disfranchised.\n If a suit were brought against a corporation it would be a decisive bar that all the members were dead.\n A corporation as a 'faculty' has no 'local habitation,' though it has a 'name.' If it is an ens rationis only, it cannot be said to reside anywhere; and it certainly occupies nothing; yet habitancy, residence, and occupation may be predicated of a corporation aggregate. The residence and inhabitancy of the particular members have been taken into consideration, and have been deemed to impart these characters to the corporation.\n Lord Coke, in his exposition of the statute of 22 Hen. VIII. c. 5. concerning the repairing of decayed bridges in highways, (2 Inst. 697. 703 .) says, 'the persons to be charged by this act are comprehended under this only word 'inhabitants.' 'Every corporation and body politic residing in any county,' & c. 'or having any lands or tenements in any shire,' &c. ' quoe propriis manibus et sumptibus possident et habent, are said to be inhabitants there within the purview of this statute.' In the case of Rex v. Gardner, Cowp. 83. it was decided that a corporation aggregate was an inhabitant or occupier of \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 66]\n\u00a0\n certain lands, and therefore liable to be taxed for them under the act of 43 Eliz. c. 2.\n It must be an inhabitant or resident where its members or officers inhabit or reside. If an action be brought against the corporation in respect of its residence or occupation, it must be competent to the corporation to show that it does not so reside or occupy, which can only be done by showing that this is not true of its members or officers.\n But the characters of individual members are in many cases examined for the purpose of settling the very question of jurisdiction.\n The division of corporations into ecclesiastical and lay, is familiar. There is nothing in the name or patent to distinguish them. 1 Bla. Com. 470. An ecclesiastical corporation is subject to the ordinary alone. His court alone has jurisdiction of proceedings by or against the corporation. 1 Bla. Com. 480. A lay corporation is visited by the founder. The king is the founder of all civil corporations, and he visits them in the king's bench.\n By ascertaining the characters of the members of the corporation alone can it be decided whether the corporation be lay or ecclesiastical; and, consequently, whether the king's bench or the ordinary has jurisdiction. Blackstone says, that an ecclesiastical corporation is where the members that compose it are entirely spiritual persons; and that the universities of Oxford and Cambridge are not ecclesiastical corporations, ' being composed of more laymen than clergy.' In this question of jurisdiction, therefore, is always involved the character of the individual members who compose the body.\n The members of a corporation are further noticed in chancery, and are compelled as individuals to execute a trust, which at common law they were not bound to do. Gilb. Uses, 5. 174. 1 Kyd, 73. 2 Leon. 122. A corporation trustee is the same in chancery \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 67]\n\u00a0\n as an individual, or number of individuals. 2 Ves. jun. 46. Attorney- General v. Foundling Hospital.\n The rule seems to be, not that the individuals confer their private privileges upon the body corporate, but that as often as justice or convenience require that the corporation should be considered as composed of natural persons, the individuals are disclosed, and their character becomes the subject of legal contemplation.\n\n 2. \nThe spirit of the constitution and laws of the United States, demands that the citizenship of the members of a corporation should be noticed in order to decide the question of jurisdiction, as well as for other purposes.\n The constitution has conferred on the courts of the United States jurisdiction in two classes of cases.\n\n 1. \nWhere the peace of the confederacy might be involved.\n\n 2. \nWhere the state tribunals could not be supposed to be impartial.\n The one upon the ground that the union was answerable for the misconduct of its members, who, by unjust decisions against aliens, might furnish a just ground of war.\n The other to preserve the real equality of citizens throughout the union, by guarding against fraudulent laws and local prejudices, in particular states.\n The design of the constitution was to retain jurisdiction in those cases where substantially these great interests were to be affected. It cannot be supposed that it was to be retained only where there was a nominal character, alien or citizen, and abandoned where substantially aliens or citizens were concerned, but whose names did not appear. It is unimportant by what name citizens are by the laws \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 68]\n\u00a0\n of their own state permitted to sue, they are still citizens, and entitled to that substantial justice, and the benefit of those independent tribunals, which were intended to be secured by the federal constitution. The constitution does not speak of the name on record; of the nominal party; it speaks of 'controversies' 'between citizens of different states.' The question is not, what names appear upon the record, but between whom is the controversy; who are the real litigants.\n In conformity with the spirit of the constitution, the federal courts have always inquired after the real parties. Although the nominal parties are really persons competent to sue in those courts, yet they will inquire into the character of the real litigants, and if they find them unable to sue there, they will dismiss the suit. 4 Dal. 330. Mansfield's Lessee v. Levy. They will allow no fiction to give jurisdiction to the court where the substance is wanting. Can it be admitted then that they will allow the jurisdiction to be excluded by a name, if the substance exists which gives jurisdiction?\n If a state be substantially a party, is the jurisdiction cut off if her agent brings a suit? The case of Fowter v. Lindsey, 3 Dal. 412. clearly implies the contrary.\n It is the privilege of citizens of one state to have their controversies with citizens of another state tried in the federal courts. The constitution guaranties it to them. It cannot be taken away, because they are authorized to bring one joint suit in a particular name, instead of bringing it in the names of each individual. Their corporate name is given them as a benefit, and ought not to be converted into an injury. Besides, if the bank cannot sue, they cannot be sued in the federal courts; nor any other corporation. The consequence is, that if a citizen of Georgia would sue the bank of the United States, at Philadelphia, he must go into the state courts. If he would sue the corporation of Philadelphia, he must \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 69]\n\u00a0\n sue in the state courts; nay, even in the county court of Philadelphia itself.\n But it is not more a question of jurisdiction than of right. If you cannot inquire who are the members of a corporation, whenever a right depends upon the question of citizenship, that right cannot be enjoyed by a corporation.\n If citizenship of the members cannot give jurisdiction, neither can their alienage. A corporation composed of aliens cannot sue in the federal courts. Neither the East-India Company, the Bank of England, nor even a sole corporation, such as the Chamberlain of London, can sue in those courts; for in his corporate capacity he is not an alien.\n An alien cannot sue a domestic corporation unless in the state courts. Although you permit an obscure alien to sue a citizen in the federal courts, yet you deny that privilege to a corporation consisting of a great number of aliens.\n Again: by the constitution, the jurisdiction of the federal courts is to extend to 'controversies between citizens of the same state, claiming lands under grants of different states;' yet a corporation of Pennsylvania claiming lands under Virginia, against a citizen of Pennsylvania claiming the same lands under Pennsylvania, must go into the courts of Pennsylvania, and cannot get into the federal courts.\n This would be a result clearly contrary to the intention and spirit of the constitution, which meant that no man claiming land by title adverse to a state should be obliged to resort to the courts of that state to try his title.\n The argument from inconvenience is very strong. Lord Coke says plurimum valet. When other reasoning is nearly on an equipoise, it ought to turn the scale. \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 70]\n\u00a0\n The court cannot consider the individual members as citizens for any purpose, if it cannot for that of jurisdiction.\n How is it under the act of congress for registering vessels? Laws of the U. S. vol. 2. p. 147. A corporation cannot hold an American registered vessel. An insurance company to whom an American vessel is abandoned must forfeit her register, although every member of that corporation be an American citizen. A foreign corporation, although composed entirely of aliens, may yet hold lands in this country, although an alien cannot.\n\n 3. \nThe practice of the courts of the United States has been uniforn and never questioned. This court has decided a great number of cases in which a corporation has been a party. It is no answer to these to say that there was no plea to the jurisdiction; for none was necessary. Whenever the court sees that it has not jurisdiction, or that its jurisdiction does not appear upon the record, it dismisses the suit. And in every case where a corporation is a party, the title of the suit alone was sufficient to give the court information.\n But this point may be considered as almost, if not quite, decided by the case of The Bank of North America v. Turner, 4 Dal. 8. where the plaintiffs were described in the same manner as the present plaintiffs, and Ch. J. Ellsworth, in delivering the opinion of the court, says, 'the plaintiffs are well described as citizens of Pennsylvania.'\n The second objection is, that by no form of pleadings can the citizenship of the members be put in issue.\n But if the citizenship be material, it may be averred; and if averred, it may be put in issue. The materiality of the averment it indeed the only question. \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 71]\n\u00a0\n 2. The second question upon this record is, whether the bank of the United States has not a peculiar right to sue in the federal courts?\n This right depends upon two questions;\n\n 1. \nWhether congress could, under the constitution, give such a jurisdiction to the circuit courts? And,\n\n 2. \nWhether congress has given it?\n\n 1. \nThe judicial power of the United States is coextensive with the legislative. It extends to all cases arising under the laws of the United States. Every case in which the bank of the United States is a party must be a case arising under those laws; for the only capacity which the bank has to sue or be sued is derived from a law of the United States. No contract can be made with the bank, no trespass can be committed upon its property, without involving the question of its existence as a corporate body, and of its rights, powers and duties, all of which depend upon the laws of the United States.\n Congress, therefore, had a right to give to the circuit courts of the United States cognisance of all cases in which the bank should be a party.\n\n 2. \nHave they done it?\n The 3d section of the act of congress which incorporated the bank, gave them the power and capacity 'to sue' 'in courts of record, or any other place whatsoever.'\n If they have a right to sue in courts of record, can it be presumed that congress meant to exclude them from the courts of the United States? the only courts over whom congress could exercise any control, and to whom alone they could imperatively impart jurisdiction. If the bank has a capacity to sue in the circuit courts, the circuit courts are bound to take cognisance of their suits. \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 72]\n\u00a0\n The presumption that congress meant to give such jurisdiction to the circuit courts is fortified by the reasonableness of the jurisdiction, the extensiveness of the institution, and its character as an agent in the fiscal operations of the United States; by the danger of an attack from some of the states; by the jealousies of state banks; by the inconvenience of discordant decisions upon the construction of their charter, and the certainty that all cases in which the bank is a party must involve questions arising under the laws of the United States.\n P. B. Key, contra.\n Two questions arise in this case.\n\n 1. \nWhether a body politic, a corporation aggregate, created by a law of the United States, is competent to sue in the circuit courts of the United States.\n\n 2. \nDoes the averment of citizenship give jurisdiction to those courts.\n\n 1. \nThe first point depends upon the constitution and laws of the United States.\n The 2d section of the 3d article of the constitution designates the limits of judicial authority which congress could confer on the several courts of the United States, but it confers no powers on the circuit courts. It defines the limits which neither congress, nor the courts erected by congress, can transcend. It was within the discretion of congress to organize courts, and grant them powers to the whole extent of the constitution; but they were under no obligation to do it.\n The question then, is, not what powers might congress give to the circuit courts, but what have they given.\n By the judiciary law of 1789, vol. 1. p. 55.  10. the circuit court has original cognisance of civil \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 73]\n\u00a0\n suits, in three cases only. 1. Where the United States is plaintiff; 2. Where an alien is a party; and, 3. Where the suit is between a citizen of the state where the suit is brought, and a citizen of another state.\n The president, directors and company of the bank of the United States do not answer to either of those cases. They are neither the United States, nor an alien, nor a citizen of a state.\n They are a corporation aggregate, consisting of many natural persons, created by the act of congress of the 25th of February, 1791, vol. 1. p. 283. under the name and style of 'The President, Directors and Company of the Bank of the United States,' and by that name only can they sue and be sued. The present suit is brought by them in their corporate name and capacity.\n A corporation aggregate is an artificial, invisible body, existing only in contemplation of law. It has no analogy to a natural person. It has no organ but its seal. It cannot sue, or be sued, for any personal injury. It cannot be outlawed. It is not subject to an attachment of contempt. It never dies. It cannot be a citizen of any state, because it cannot owe allegiance. It cannot commit treason nor felony. It can have no residence, because it is an artificial, invisible, intangible body. It cannot appear in person, but must appear by attorney. For all these reasons it cannot come within the description of those who are entitled to sue in the circuit courts of the United States. Neither residence nor inhabitancy is sufficient to give jurisdiction. It must be a citizen, possessing political rights, and owing allegiance to some state.\n The bank has mistaken its proper course. Wherever the only ground of jurisdiction is a question upon the construction of the constitution, or of a law, or treaty of the United States, the only remedy is by writ of error from this court to the highest \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 74]\n\u00a0\n state tribunal having cognisance of the cause, agreeably to the provisions of the 25th section of the judiciary act of 1789. Vol. 1. p. 63.\n If an act of congress could authorize any person to sue in the federal courts, on the ground of its being a case arising under a law of the United States, it would be in the power of congress to give unlimited jurisdiction to its courts. But it is only when the state courts disregard or misconstrue the constitution, laws, or treaties, of the United States, that the federal courts have cognisance under that clause of the constitution which declares that the judicial power shall extend to all cases arising under the constitution, laws and treaties of the United States.\n It is supposed to be absurd to say that the United States have erected a body corporate, and given it a power to sue and be sued in any courts but those of the power creating the corporation. But there is nothing absurd in the idea. Persons are daily becoming citizens of the United States, under an act of congress, and yet they have no right to sue in the federal courts except in particular cases, and under special circumstances; if the bank can bring itself within one of those cases, and clothe itself with those special circumstances, it may sue in those courts.\n But it is contended that it has brought itself within one of those cases, by the averment that the president, directors and company of the bank of the United States are citizens of the state of Pennsylvania, and the defendants citizens of the state of Georgia.\n This averment cannot give jurisdiction; because,\n\n 1. \nIt is repugnant and void; and,\n\n 2. \nIt is contrary to their own showing on the face of the declaration.\n\n 1. \nIt is repugnant because the suit is brought in the corporate name. The corporation is the plaintiff, \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 75]\n\u00a0\n and it is absurd and impossible to say that a corporation aggregate is a citizen or citizens. The body politic is the plaintiff, and not the individual stockholders.\n\n 2. \nIt is contrary to their own showing, because they have in the declaration expressly averred themselves to be a body corporate, and to sue in that capacity; and an averment relative to the individual sharacters of the stockholders is in contradiction to the corporate character in which they sue. No corporation aggregate can derive aid from the personal character of its members; nor does it incur any disability from the disabilities of the individuals who compose the society. Neither the infancy, coverture, nor outlawry of the individuals can affect the body corporate.\n It is laid down in the books that 'an averment contrary to that which appears to the court, shall not avail.' Com. Dig. tit. Pleader.\n But it is said that you may raise the veil which the corporate name interposes, and see who stand behind it. You may strip them of the corporate capacity in which they sue, to give the court a jurisdiction which they cannot claim in their corporate capacity.\n But the name of a corporation is not a mere accident. It is substance. It is the knot of its combination. It is its essence. It is the thing itself. 1 Tuck. Bl. 474, 475.\n As to the case of ejectment from 4 Dal. 333. the nominal plaintiff must have the same character, as to citizenship, as his lessor; and the court will be astute to see that no deception be practised upon them to give them a jurisdiction which they could not otherwise exercise.\n The authority from 2 Inst. 697. only proves that a corporation aggregate may be adjudged to be an \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 76]\n\u00a0\n inhabitant in respect to its holding of lands, and so as to render those lands liable to taxes for the repair of bridges and highways under the statute of 22 H. VIII. c. 5.\n In the case of The King v. The Inhabitants of St. Bartholomews, in 4 Burr. 2435. Lord Mansfield said the corporation were not occupiers. And in Rex v. Gardner, Cowp. 84. the question was whether a corporation, seised in fee for its own profit, was ratable to the poor, under a law which taxed all inhabitants. The court decided that inasmuch as persons seised in fee were always assessed as inhabitants of the land, if there was no other tenant upon it, a corporation seised in fee should, pro hac vice, be deemed an inhabitant within the meaning of that statute. But this goes but a little way towards proving that a corporation aggregate may be a citizen for the purpose of giving jurisdiction to the federal courts; or towards establishing the point that the court will inquire into the individual circumstances of the members of a corporation, for the same purpose.\n Of still less weight is the doctrine respecting the visitatortal power in England. That power is given for the express purpose of examining the qualifications of the members, to see whether the charter of the corporation has been adhered to in the election of members, and whether the corporation has acted consistently with the purposes of its creation. It is not a power to examine the character of the individuals to ascertain whether the corporation has a right to sue in a certain court.\n At law, a corporation cannot be a trustee. And a court of equity acts in persons to compel the members to perform their corporate functions; but even this doctrine depends upon the mere dictum of a lord chancellor.\n In the case cited from 4 Dal. 8. the question respecting the averment of citizenship was not raised. The gentlemen of the bar were not very \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 77]\n\u00a0\n desirous of raising questions as to the jurisdiction of the federal courts.\n If denial of justice be a cause of war, as is alleged, the person who claims it must preserve an entirety of character; he must not associate himself with others who have no right to claim it in that form. Foreign nations have no right to prescribe the mode of administering justice to their subjects in this country. If they have the same resort to the same courts which our own citizens enjoy, they cannot complain.\n But it is said that the death of all the members of a corporation is a fact which may be pleaded; that cannot be pleaded unless you can go into the question who were the last members of the corporation. And if you can plead any thing respecting the individual members, you may plead their citizenship. But if this be true, it must be pleaded in a different manner. The name of each individual must be set forth, and his death averred. And it may well be doubted whether even such a plea would be good; and whether the only remedy would not be by quo warranto; or a rule to show cause.\n If the averment in the declaration relate to the body politic, it is repugnant. If to the individual members, it is immaterial. No issue could have been taken upon it. It does not name a single individual member of the corporation. If they had named every individual, it would have appeared that some of them were citizens of Georgia. If the defendant had pleaded that A. B., one of the members, was a citizen of Georgia, it would have been a bad plea, because immaterial and argumentative.\n Jones, on the same side, cited Co. Litt. 66. b. 10 Co. 32. b. 1 Ld. Raym. 80. 2 Cranch, 445. 2 Burr. 1054. 1 Bl. Com. 497. 512. 10 Co. 30. 1 Bl. Com. 502. 1 Leach's Cr. Law, 287.\n This cause being argued in connection with the \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 78]\n\u00a0\n cases of The Hope Insurance Company of Providence against Boardman et al., ante, p. 57. and The Maryland Insurance Company against Wood, post, in the latter of which Mr. Harper was counsel for the defendant in error, he was permitted to reply to the arguments of the plaintiffs in error in this case.\n Harper, in reply.\n The point of jurisdiction gives rise to two questions.\n\n 1. \nAs to the form of the averment.\n\n 2. \nAs to the effect of the incorporation on the original character of the members.\n\n 1. \nIn the case of The Maryland Insurance Company against Wood, the averment is, 'The Maryland Insurance Company, citizens of the state of Maryland.'\n This does not mean that the corporation, as such, is a citizen of Maryland, but that the individuals who compose it are citizens. It is the same thing in substance as to say, 'The Maryland Insurance Company, a corporate body composed of persons who are citizens of Maryland.'\n It is objected that such an averment cannot be true; but it is surely possible that all the members of a corporate body may be citizens of one state; and with regard to insurance companies it is almost always true. But if not true, the contrary may be shown.\n It is also objected that the averment is defective, because it does not name the individuals who are affirmed to be citizens.\n But it may be answered that they need not be named, because they have authority to join in the \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 79]\n\u00a0\n suit in their corporate name, and therefore in that name may make the averment. There is no uncertainty, because it is averred that they are all citizens. But if it were necessary to aver that some were citizens, in that case it would be necessary to show who they were. If the fact be not as averred, it may be pleaded, and the plea may state that A., B. and C. are members of the corporation, and are citizens of another state.\n\n 2. \nAs to the effect of the incorporation.\n The question is not whether a corporation can be a citizen in its corporate capacity.\n But whether, by becoming members of the corporation, the individuals who compose it lose, in their corporate affairs, those privileges which as individuals they possessed before.\n This leads us to inquire into the nature and objects of an incorporation.\n\n 1. \nOf its nature.\n It is a privilege conferred on a number of individuals. The corporate body is the form under which the privilege is enjoyed and exercised. The individuals are the substance. It is a fiction of law; the individuals are the real parties. It is a trustee; the individuals are the cestui que trusts.\n It is a privilege conferred and accepted. But neither the grant nor the acceptance deprives the party accepting it of other privileges which he before possessed, unless they be incompatible with each other.\n Thus the law confers on infants the privilege of being free from the obligation of their contracts; and it takes from them the privilege of acquiring rights under those contracts, because these two privileges are incompatible; but it does not take \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 80]\n\u00a0\n from them the privilege of suing for rights derived otherwise than from their contracts.\n So a woman, by entering into wedlock, acquires the privilege of being free from arrest for debt. And she renounces the privilege of making contracts, because that would be incompatible; but she does not renounce the privilege of taking land by descent, gift or devise.\n So a man, by entering into civil society, acquires the privilege of being protected by the society; and he renounces the privilege of seeking, by his own force, redress for his wrongs, because incompatible. But he does not renounce the privilege of defending himself against personal violence.\n The privileges of a corporation are,\n\n 1. \nTo sue and be sued by a corporate name.\n\n 2. \nTo have perpetual succession by the transfer or transmission of the shares, &c.\n\n 3. \nTo make contracts by which the separate property or persons of the individuals shall not be bound.\n These privileges are not incompatible with that now claimed.\n But an incorporation is not only a privilege, but it is a privilege conferred on individuals. Individuals are the basis and essence of the corporation. It cannot subsist without them. The law must take notice of them. It must take notice of their character and privileges as individuals. The existence of the corporate body cannot be known without taking notice of the individuals. The most important of its privileges, that of perpetual succession, depends upon it.\n If the law cannot notice the privileges of individuals, \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 81]\n\u00a0\n neither can it notice their obligations or disabilities.\n It may happen that all the members of a corporation may be infants or femes covert. Suppose in an action brought by this corporation the statute of limitations should be pleaded, could not the plaintiff reply the infancy or coverture?\n Again, suppose a corporation to have existed and made a contract in Pennsylvania with a citizen of Maryland; suppose that all the members came into Maryland, and after remaining there some time returned to Pennsylvania; and that three years afterwards the corporation brought suit in Maryland, on the contract; could not the statute of limitations be pleaded? And if the plaintiffs should reply absence from the state, might not the defendant rejoin the special matter?\n Suppose all the members of a corporation to be outlawed, could not the outlawry be pleaded to an action brought by the corporation?\n Suppose the corporation to hold land, and all the members to be attained of treason, would not the land be forfeited?\n Suppose a corporation to be composed entirely of alien enemies, could such a corporation sue? Might not the special matter be pleaded?\n The corporate body is the form; the individuals are the substance. The purpose of the incorporation is to enable individuals to transact business more conveniently for their mutual benefit. Individual benefit is the object. The incorporation is the instrument and means, like the fictitious lessee, and casual ejector, in ejectment.\n The construction contended for would sacrifice the \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 82]\n\u00a0\n substance to the form, and would make the means defeat the end.\n The corporation is a fiction of law; the individual members are the real parties. But fictions of law are introduced for the benefit of the real parties, not for their injury; and they are to be so moulded as to answer the purpose. Fictions of law never must shut out the truth. But the construction contended for would set up a fiction against the truth. The parties here are in fact citizens of different states; but this fiction, it is said, must preclude them from averring the fact.\n The corporate body is a trustee. The individual members are the cestui que trusts. It is like infant and prochein ami.\n Suppose a man, seised in fee of lands in Pennsylvania, mortgages it to a citizen of that state, and then devises it in fee to a citizen of Maryland in trust for a feme covert also a citizen of Maryland and her heirs. The trustee dies, and his heir on whom the trust descends, is a citizen of Pennsylvania. The feme covert dies, leaving issue citizens of Maryland, upon whom the trust estate descends.\n Cannot the issue, joining the heir of the trustee, bring a bill to redeem in the circuit court of Pennsylvania? Would not the court look to the real parties?\n Again, suppose an infant citizen of Maryland sues in the circuit court of Pennsylvania, by a prochein ami who is a citizen of Pennsylvania, has not that court jurisdiction of the case?\n\n 2. \nOf the object of the incorporation.\n It is to confer additional privileges and advantages, not to take away those formerly held. To the privilege of suing in the federal courts in their individual \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 83]\n\u00a0\n capacity, was superadded the privilege of so suing in their corporate capacity.\n The true construction is, that they should sue and be sued in their corporate capacity, to the whole extent, and in as beneficial a manner, as in their individual capacity.\n The construction contended for would restrict the privilege of suing; and would take away one of its most important properties.\n One great object in allowing citizens of different states to sue in the federal courts, was to obtain a uniformity of decision in cases of a commercial nature. The most numerous and important class of those cases, and the class in which it is most important to have uniform rules and principles, is that of insurance cases. They are almost wholly confined to corporations, though most frequently, in fact, between citizens of different states.\n Ingersoll, on the same side, and also in reply to the argument of Mr. Adams, in the case of The Hope Insurance Company v. Boardman et al.\n The character of the corporation must follow the character of its members. The averment of the citizenship of its members is sufficient. But it is clear that a corporation aggregate cannot be a citizen. An averment of residence is not sufficient. 1 Cranch, 343. Abercrombie v. Dupuis. The place of its establishment does not make it a citizen. It is not necessary, under its charter, that all the members of The Hope Insurance Company of Providence should be citizens of the state of Rhode Island. The declaration in that case does not even aver either the corporation or its members to be citizens of any state whatever. If any one of the members be a citizen of the state in which the suit is brought, the federal court has no jurisdiction. 3 Cranch, 267. Strawbridge v. Curtiss. \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 84]\n\u00a0\n It is a bold proposition to say that no corporation can sue in the federal courts. It would be in hostility to the spirit of the constitution, and would deprive the citizens of one state of that chance of justice in their contests with citizens of another state, which the constitution intended to secure to all; and this merely because they have been enabled to sue under a fictitious name.\n Every corporation aggregate must be composed of natural persons, and courts of law will take notice of them as members of the corporate body. If a suit be brought by or against the inhabitants of an incorporated town, the court will inquire whether any of the jurors or witnesses are inhabitants. So a corporate body may own an American registered ship, and one of the corporation may take the necessary oaths.\n Numerous cases have already been decided in the federal courts, in which a corporation has been a party, involving the right of property to the amount of millions. What will become of all these cases? In all the cases within the last five years writs of error will be brought.\n In ejectment, the court, on a question of jurisdiction, always inquires who are the real parties.\n The constitution declares that the judicial power shall extend to ' controversies' 'between citizens of different states.' It is necessary, therefore, that the court should inquire between whom the real controversy exists.\n March 15.\n\n MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows:\n Two points have been made in this cause.\n\n 1. \nThat a corporation, composed of citizens of \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 85]\n\u00a0\n one state, may sue a citizen of another state, in the federal courts.\n\n 2. \nI hat a right to sue in those courts is conferred on this bank by the law which incorporates it.\n The last point will be first considered.\n The judicial power of the United States, as defined in the constitution, is dependent, 1st. On the nature of the case; and, 2d. On the character of the parties.\n By the judicial act, the jurisdiction of the circuit courts is extended to cases where the constitutional right to plead and be impleaded, in the courts of the union, depends on the character of the parties; but where that right depends on the nature of the case, the circuit courts derive no jurisdiction from that act, except in the single case of a controversy between citizens of the same state, claiming lands under grants from different states.\n Unless, then, jurisdiction over this cause has been given to the circuit court by some other than the judicial act, the bank of the United States had not a right to sue in that court, upon the principle that the case arises under a law of the United States.\n The plaintiffs contend that the incorporating act confers this jurisdiction.\n That act creates the corporation, gives it a capacity to make contracts and to acquire property, and enables it 'to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and be answered, defend and be defended, in courts of record, or any other place whatsoever.'\n This power, if not incident to a corporation, is conferred by every incorporating act, and is not understood to enlarge the jurisdiction of any particular court, but to give a capacity to the corporation to \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 86]\n\u00a0\n appear, as a corporation, in any court which would, by law, have cognisance of the cause, if brought by individuals. If jurisdiction is given by this clause to the federal courts, it is equally given to all courts having original jurisdiction, and for all sums however small they may be.\n But the 9th article of the 7th section of the act furnishes a conclusive argument against the construction for which the plaintiffs contend. That section subjects the president and directors, in their individual capacity, to the suit of any person aggrieved by their putting into circulation more notes than is permitted by law, and expressly authorizes the bringing of that action in the federal or state courts.\n This evinces the opinion of congress, that the right to sue does not imply a right to sue in the courts of the union, unless it be expressed. This idea is strengthened also by the law respecting patent rights. That law expressly recognises the right of the patentee to sue in the circuit courts of the United States.\n The court, then, is of opinion, that no right is conferred on the bank, by the act of incorporation, to sue in the federal courts.\n\n 2. \nThe other point is one of much more difficulty.\n The jurisdiction of this court being limited, so far as respects the character of the parties in this particular case, 'to controversies between citizens of different states,' both parties must be citizens, to come within the description.\n That invisible, intangible, and artificial being, that mere legal entity, a corporation aggregate, is certainly not a citizen; and, consequently, cannot sue or be sued in the courts of the United States, unless the rights of the members, in this respect, can be exercised in their corporate name. If the corporation \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 87]\n\u00a0\n be considered as a mere faculty, and not as a company of individuals, who, in transacting their joint concerns, may use a legal name, they must be excluded from the courts of the union.\n The duties of this court, to exercise jurisdiction where it is conferred, and not to usurp it where it is not conferred, are of equal obligation. The constitution, therefore, and the law, are to be expounded, without a leaning the one way or the other, according to those general principles which usually govern in the construction of fundamental or other laws.\n A constitution, from its nature, deals in generals, not in detail. Its framers cannot perceive minute distinctions which arise in the progress of the nation, and therefore confine it to the establishment of broad and general principles.\n The judicial department was introduced into the American constitution under impressions, and with views, which are too apparent not to be perceived by all. However, true the fact may be, that the tribunals of the states will administer justice as impartially as those of the nation, to parties of every description, it is not less true that the constitution itself either entertains apprehensions on this subject, or views with such indulgence the possible fears and apprehensions of suitors, that it has established national tribunals for the decision of controversies between aliens and a citizen, or between citizens of different states. Aliens, or citizens of different states, are not less susceptible of these apprehensions, nor can they be supposed to be less the objects of constitutional provision, because they are allowed to sue by a corporate name. That name, indeed, cannot be an alien or a citizen; but the persons whom it represents may be the one or the other; and the controversy is, in fact and in law, between those persons suing in their corporate character, by their corporate name, for a corporate right, and the individual against whom the suit may be instituted. Substantially \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 88]\n\u00a0\n and essentially, the parties in such a case, where the members of the corporation are aliens, or citizens of a different state from the opposite party, come within the spirit and terms of the jurisdiction conferred by the constitution of the national tribunals.\n Such has been the universal understanding on the subject. Repeatedly has this court decided causes between a corporation and an individual without feeling a doubt respecting its jurisdiction. Those decisions are not cited as authority; for they were made without considering this particular point; but they have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench; and that the common understanding of intelligent men is in favour of the right of incorporated aliens, or citizens of a different state from the defendant, to sue in the national courts. It is by a course of acute, metaphysical and abstruse reasoning, which has been most ably employed on this occasion, that this opinion is shaken.\n As our ideas of a corporation, its privileges and its disabilities, are derived entirely from the English books, we resort to them for aid, in ascertaining its character. It is defined as a mere creature of the law, invisible, intangible, and incorporeal. Yet, when we examine the subject further, we find that corporations have been included within terms of description appropriated to real persons.\n The statute of Henry VIII. concerning bridges and highways, enacts, that bridges and highways shall be made and repaired by the 'inhabitants of the city, shire, or riding,' and that the justices shall have power to tax every 'inhabitant of such city,' &c. and that the collectors may 'distrain every such inhabitant as shall be taxed and refuse payment thereof, in his lands, goods and chattels.'\n Under this statute those have been construed inhabitants who hold lands within the city where the \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 89]\n\u00a0\n bridge to be repaired lies, although they reside elsewhere.\n Lord Coke says, 'every corporation and body politic residing in any county, riding, city, or town corporate, or having lands or tenements in any shire, quae propriis manibus et sumptibus possident et habent, are said to be inhabitants there, within the purview of this statute.'\n The tax is not imposed on the person, whether he be a member of the corporation or not, who may happen to reside on the lands; but is imposed on the corporation itself, and, consequently, this ideal existence is considered as an inhabitant, when the general spirit and purpose of the law requires it.\n In the case of The King v. Gardner, reported by Cowper, a corporation was decided, by the court of king's bench, to come within the description of 'occupiers or inhabitants.' In that case the poor rates, to which the lands of the corporation were declared to be liable, were not assessed to the actual occupant, for there was none, but to the corporation. And the principle established by the case appears to be, that the poor rates, on vacant ground belonging to a corporation, may be assessed to the corporation, as being inhabitants or occupiers of that ground. In this case Lord Mansfield notices and overrules an inconsiderate dictum of Justice Yates, that a corporation could not be an inhabitant or occupier.\n These opinions are not precisely in point; but they serve to show that, for the general purposes and objects of a law, this invisible, incorporeal creature of the law may be considered as having corporeal qualities.\n It is true that as far as these cases go they serve to show that the corporation itself, in its incorporeal character, may be considered as an inhabitant or an occupier; and the argument from them would be more strong in favour of considering the corporation \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 90]\n\u00a0\n itself as endowed for this special purpose with the character of a citizen, then to consider the character of the individuals who compose it as a subject which the court can inspect, when they use the name of the corporation, for the purpose of asserting their corporate rights. Still the cases show that this technical definition of a corporation does not uniformly circumscribe its capacities, but that courts for legitimate purposes will contemplate it more substantially.\n There is a case, however, reported in 12 Mod. which is thought precisely in point. The corporation of London brought a suit against Wood, by their corporate name, in the mayor's court. The suit was brought by the mayor and commonalty, and was tried before the mayor and aldermen. The judgment rendered in this cause was brought before the court of king's bench and reversed, because the court was deprived of its jurisdiction by the character of the individuals who were members of the corporation.\n In that case the objection, that a corporation was an invisible, intangible thing, a mere incorporeal legal entity, in which the characters of the individuals who composed it were completely merged, was urged and was considered. The judges unanimously declared that they could look beyond the corporate name, and notice the character of the individual. In the opinions, which were delivered seriatim, several cases are put which serve to illustrate the principle, and fortify the decision.\n The case of The Mayor and Commonalty v. Wood, is the stronger, because it is on the point of jurisdiction. It appears to the court to be a full authority for the case now under consideration. It seems not possible to distinguish them from each other.\n If, then, the congress of the United States had, in terms, enacted that incorporated aliens might sue \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 91]\n\u00a0\n a citizen, or that the incorporated citizens of one state might sue a citizen of another state, in the federal courts, by its corporate name, this court would not have felt itself justified in declaring that such a law transcended the constitution.\n The controversy is substantially between aliens, suing by a corporate name, and a citizen, or between citizens of one state, suing by a corporate name, and those of another state. When these are said to be substantially the parties to the controversy, the court does not mean to liken it to the case of a trustee. A trustee is a real person capable of being a citizen or an alien, who has the whole legal estate in himself. At law, he is the real proprietor, and he represents himself, and sues in his own right. But in this case the corporate name represents persons who are members of the corporation.\n If the constitution would authorize congress to give the courts of the union jurisdiction in this case, in consequence of the character of the members of the corporation, then the judicial act ought to be construed to give it. For the term citizen ought to be understood as it is used in the constitution, and as it is used in other laws. That is, to describe the real persons who come into court, in this case, under their corporate name.\n That corporations composed of citizens are considered by the legislature as citizens, under certain circumstances, is to be strongly inferred from the registering act. It never could be intended that an American registered vessel, abandoned to an insurance company composed of citizens, should lose her character as an American vessel; and yet this would be the consequence of declaring that the members of the corporation were, to every intent and purpose, out of view, and merged in the corporation.\n The court feels itself authorized by the case in 12 Mod. on a question of jurisdiction, to look to \n\n[9 U.S. 61, 92]\n\u00a0\n the character of the individuals who compose the corporation, and they think that the precedents of this court, though they were not decisions on argument, ought not to be absolutely disregarded.\n If a corporation may sue in the courts of the union, the court is of opinion that the averment in this case is sufficient.\n Being authorized to sue in their corporate name, they could make the averment, and it must apply to the plaintiffs as individuals, because it could not be true as applied to the corporation.\n Judgment reversed; plea in abatement overruled, and cause remanded.\n Judge LIVINGSTON, having an interest in the question, gave no opinion. \n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHE GENERAL PICKNEY(1809)\n\nArgued: Decided: February 1, 1809\n\n\n THIS was an appeal from the sentence of the circuit court for the district of Maryland, which condemned the schooner General Pinkney and cargo, for breach of the act of congress prohibiting intercourse with certain ports of the island of St. Domingo; passed February, 28th 1806. Vol. 8, p. 11. This act was limited to one year; but by the act of February 24th, 1807, it was continued until the end of the then next session of congress, when it expired on the 26th of April, 1808.\n The schooner General Pinkney, on the 23d of August, 1806, was cleared from Alexandria for St. Jago de Cuba with a cargo, but went to Cape Francois in the island of St. Domingo, one of the prohibited ports. On her return, she was seized on the 17th of November, 1806, and libelled on the 5th of January, 1807, and condemned in the district court on the 23d of July following, which condemnation was affirmed in the circuit court on the 7th of November, from which sentence the claimants immediately appealed, in open court, to the supreme court of the United States, then next to be holden on the first Monday of February, 1808, where the cause was continued until the present term. \n\n[9 U.S. 281, 282]\n\u00a0\n The only question now argued was, whether this court could now affirm the sentence of condemnation, inasmuch as the law which created the forfeiture, and authorized the condemnation, had expired?\n C. Lee, Martin, Harper and Youngs, for the appellants, contended that, in all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, an appeal suspends entirely the sentence appealed from; and that in the appellate court the cause stands as if no sentence had been pronounced. 1 Browne's Civil Law, 495. 501. 1 Br.

The Betsey & Chatlotte. Purker, 72.\n If then the case stands as if no sentence of condemnation has been passed, the question arises, can this court now proceed to condemn the vessel when there is no law authorizing a condemnation?\n The act of congress makes no provision for the recovery (after the expiration of the act) of penalties or forfeitures which had been incurred under that act during its existence.\n And in such cases the law has always been understood to be, that the penalty or forfeiture cannot be enforced, nor the punishment inflicted. The court has no longer any jurisdiction in the case. 2 East's Cr. Law, 576. Jones's case. 1 W. Bl. 451. Miller's case. 4 Dal. 373. 1 Hale, 291. The case of the United States v.

J. Ellsworth, in the case of Wiscart v. Dauchy, 3 Dal. 327. where he says, 'an appeal is a process of civil law origin, and removes a cause entirely, subjecting the fact as well as the law to a review and retrial;' and to the opinion of Marshall, Ch. J. in the case of Pennington v. Coxe, 2 Cranch, 61.\n March 7.\n\n MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court to the following effect:\n The majority of the court is clearly of opinion, that in admiralty cases an appeal suspends the sentence altogether; and that it is not res adjudicata until the final sentence of the appellate court be pronounced. The cause in the appellate court is to be heard de novo, as if no sentence had been passed. This has been the uniform practice not only in cases of appeal from the district to the circuit courts of the United States, but in this court also.\n In prize causes, the principle has never been disputed; and in the instance court, it is stated in 2 Browne's Civil Law, that in cases of appeal it is lawful to allege what has not before been alleged, and to prove what has not before been proved. \n*\n\u00a0\n\n The court is, therefore, of opinion, that this cause is to be considered as if no sentence had been pronounced; and if no sentence had been pronounced, it has been long settled, on general principles, that after the expiration or repeal of a law, no penalty can be enforced, nor punishment inflicted, for violations of the law committed while it was in force, unless some special provision be made for that purpose by statute. \n\n[9 U.S. 281, 284]\n\u00a0\n The following sentence was then pronounced by the court:\n This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record, and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof the court is of opinion, that an appeal from the sentence of a court of admiralty brings the whole case before the appellate court unaffected by the sentence of condemnation from which the appeal is made, and that a sentence of condemnation cannot be pronounced on account of a forfeiture which accrued under a law not in force at the time of pronouncing such sentence, unless, by some statutory provision, the right to enforce such forfeiture be preserved.\n The court is, therefore, of opinion, that the sentence pronounced in this cause by the circuit court of the district of Maryland, affirming the sentence of the judge of the district court in this cause, be reversed and annulled; and the court, proceeding to pronounce the proper sentence, doth direct that the libel be dismissed, and the property libelled be restored to the claimants, they paying the duties thereon if the same have not been already paid.\n And, on the motion of the attorney-general, it is ordered to be certified that in the opinion of this court, there was probable cause of seizure. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Clerke's Praxis, tit. 54.

PETERS(1809)\n\nArgued: Decided: February 1, 1809\n\n\n AT the last term Gideon Olmstead, in behalf of himself and Artimus White, Aquilla Rumsdale, and David Clark, moved the court for a mandamus* to be directed to the honourable Richard Peters, judge of the district court of the United States for the Pennsylvania district, commanding him to order and direct an attachment or other proper process to issue to enforce obedience to the sentence of the said district court in a civil cause of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, in which the said Gildeon Olmstead and others were libellants, and Elizabeth Serjeant and Esther Waters were respondents. This motion was made upon a suggestion, supported by affidavit, that a copy of the sentence had been served upon the respondents, which they refused to obey; and that application had been made to the judge for an attachment, which he had refused to grant; whereupon a mandamus nisi was granted returnable to this term; when the judge made the following return: \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 116]\n\u00a0\n 'To the honourable the supreme court of the United States,\n'The subscriber, judge of the district court of the United States in and for the district of Pennsylvania, in obedience to the mandamus issued by order of the supreme court in the case of Gideon Olmstead and others, libellants, against the surviving executrixes of the late David Rittenhouse, Esq. and to the said district judge directed, begs leave to return,\n\n'That the proceedings of the district court in the above cause, which are herewith transmitted, and respectfully submitted, will show the grounds of the judgment by the said court rendered. Every opportunity, through the whole course of these proceedings, was given to the parties to litigate the claim, or discuss questions, either on the merits or jurisdiction. Nor was any step taken, without due and timely notice.\n\n'The answer of the respondents will show their objections to the claim of the libellants. This answer refere to an act of assembly of the state of Pennsylvania, passed the 26th day of February, 1801, which was not produced or brought under the legal notice of the court.\n\n'No application for execution of the decree was made until within twelve or eighteen months past; nor has it been, till more recently, much pressed.\n\n'By the suggestion filed by the respondents, their objections to the execution of the decree will appear. They have made an act of assembly of the state of Pennsylvania a part of their suggestion; and thus, for the first time, during the pendency of the suit, brought this act under the judicial notice of the court. It is entitled 'An act relating to the claim of this commonwealth against Elizabeth Serjeant and Esther Waters, surviving executrixes of David Rittenhouse, Esq. deceased, passed \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 117]\n\u00a0\n April the second, 1803:' and to this act I pray leave to refer.\n\n'This act, or any of its allegations, has no influence on my opinion. Let this opinion be erroneous or correct, a proceeding, in some of its parts, indecorous, and, in others, unjustifiable, can have no operation in rectifying supposed errors, or convincing my judgment. But from prudential, more than other motives, I deemed it best to avoid embroiling the government of the United States and that of Pennsylvania (if the latter government should choose so to do) on a question which has rested on my single opinion, so far as it is touched by my decree; and, under the influence of this sentiment, I have withheld the process required. If this be not considered a legal cause, it must be deemed a candid acknowledgment that I do not invariably obey a rigorous dictate of duty, or follow an inflexibly strict construction of law.\n\n'I entertained a hope that a legislature succeeding that by which the act before mentioned was passed, would, under a more temperate view of the subject, have repealed it; and enabled and directed the executive of the state, or some other authority, to put this case in a legal train of investigation: so that the final judgment and decree of the superior tribunal of the United States might have been, in a proper course, obtained; and thereby any erroneous opinion, or decree, given or made by me, might have been rectified (if any opinion or decree should have been found illegal or erroneous) in a manner more becoming the real dignity of a state, more suitable to the situation of those who execute the duties of a branch of the government of the United States, and more consistent with the good order and peace of the community. This hope was cherished by the proceedings of the legislature of Pennsylvania, in other cases wherein the state claimed interests. This expectation has been disappointed. There being no other legal mode or obtaining the decision of \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 118]\n\u00a0\n the superior tribunal of the United States, (the only jurisdiction by which the judgments of inferior courts of the United States can be finally rectified or judicially annulled,) I have thought it proper, and, under all circumstances, fully justifiable, to obtain that decision, by placing the case under the cognisance of your honourable court, in its present form.\n\n'On the merits and justice of the claim of the libellants, I have no doubt; but remain of the same opinion I have mentioned in my decree.\n\n'As to the jurisdiction; I have never conceived that the allegations on this point, contained in the act of assembly last mentioned, had legal foundation. It is well known to your honourable court, that third persons claiming interests in pais, cannot, by such claims, constitute themselves, or be judidially considered, parties in suits pending in the names of others. Nor does there now exist any legal mode of interpleading, or compelling states to become parties to suits in the courts of the United States. Yet if your honourable court shall be of opinion that the objections to jurisdiction are relevant, I shall, agreeably to my duty, continue to withhold any farther proceeding. But if, on the other hand, a peremptory direction to execute the decree shall be the consequence of your deliberations, having now the whole case before you, there can be no order or direction, which it is in my legal obligation to obey, to which ( impelled by a sense of justice, however I may regret the circumstance, as it respects the parties respondents, or other consequences which may flow from it) I shall more cheerfully submit.\n\n'RICHARD PETERS.\n\n'Philadelphia, July 18th, 1808.'\n\n The facts as they appear in the record and documents referred to by the judge, the above answer, were in substance as follows.\n Gideon Olmstead, Artimus White, Aquilla \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 119]\n\u00a0\n Rumsdale and David Clark citizens and inhabitants of the state of Connecticut, were, during the revolutionary war, captured by the British and carried to Jamaica, where they were put on board the sloop Active to assist as mariners in navigating the sloop to New-York, then in possession of the Britain, with a cargo of supplies for the fleets and armies of Great Britain. During which voyage, about the 6th of September, 1778, they rose upon the master and crew of the sloop, confined them to the cabin, took the command of the vessel and steered for Egg Harbour, in the state of New-Jersey. On the 8th of September, when in sight of that harbour they were pursued, and forcibly taken possession of by Captain Thomas Houston, commander of the armed brig Convention, belonging to the state of Pennsylvania, and, on the 15th of September, brought into the port of Philadelphia; when Houston libelled the vessel as prize to the Convention. A claim was interposed by Captain James Josiah, master of the American privateer Le Gerard, who claimed a share of the capture as having been in sight and by agreement cruising in concert with the Convention. A claim was also interposed by Olmstead and others for the whole vessel and cargo, as being their exclusive prize. The state court of admiralty, however, adjudged them only one fourth part, and decreed the residue to be divided between the state and the owners of the privateer, and the officers and crews of the Convention and the Le Gerard. From this sentence Olmstead and others appealed to the court of commissioners of appeals in prize causes for the United States of America, where, on the 15th of December, 1778, the sentence of the state court was reversed, and it was ordered and adjudged that the vessel and cargo should be condemned as lawful prize for the use of the appellants, Olmstead and others, and that the marshal should sell the same, and pay the net proceeds to them or their agent or attorney. Upon receipt of a copy of this sentence, the court of admiralty made the following order:- \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 120]\n\u00a0\n 'Thomas Houston, Esq. et al., appellees, ads.\n'Gideon Olmstead, Artimus White, Aquilla Rumsdale, and David Clark, appellants, claimants of the sloop Active and her cargo.\n\n'In the court of Admiralty, for the State of Pennsylvania.\n\n'The court, taking into consideration the decree of the court of appeals in this cause, reversing the judgment or sentence of this court in the same cause, and further decreeing a condemnation of the sloop Active, her tackle, apparel, furniture and cargo, as prize, &c. and that process of this court should issue for the sale of the said sloop, her cargo, &c. and for the distribution of the moneys arising from the said sale after deducting costs, to the claimants above named, their agent or attorney; after mature consideration are of opinion, that although the court of appeals have full authority to alter or set aside the decree of a judge of this court, yet that the finding of the jury in the cause does establish the facts in the cause without re-examination or appeal. And therefore the verdict of the jury still standing, and being in full force, this court cannot issue any process, or proceed in any manner whatsoever contradictory to the finding of the said jury. And therefore doth now decree, order and adjudge, that the marshal of this court be commanded to sell at public vendue at the highest price that can be gotten for the same, the said sloop or vessel called the Active, her tackle, apparel and furniture, and the goods, wares and merchandises laden and found on board her at the time of her capture, &c. and after deducting the costs and charges of the trial, condemnation and sale thereof, out of the moneys arising from the said sale, that he bring the residue thereof into court, there to remain ready to abide the further order of this court therein.\n\n'George Rose.\n\n'December 28th, 1778.'- \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 121]\n\u00a0\n The finding of the jury, alluded to in the above order, was in these words:\n\n'In the cause wherein Thomas Houston is libellant, and Olmstead and others first claimants, and James Josiah second claimant, we find as follows:\n\n 1-4th of the net proceeds of the sloop Active and her cargo to the first claimants.\n 3-4ths of the net proceeds of said sloop and her cargo to the libellant and to the second claimants, as per agreement between them.\n'Nov. 4th, 1778.'\n\n The warrant which Judge Ross directed to be issued to the marshal to make sale of the vessel and cargo, in pursuance of the above order, and which was accordingly issued on the 28th of December, 1778, after reciting the proceedings in this court, and in the court of appeals, proceeds as follows: 'This court therefor taking into consideration the premises, and being of opinion that consistent with the laws of this state it cannot carry into execution the whole of the said sentence of the honourable the court of appeals aforesaid: yet willing, so far as the said sentence appears legal, to carry it into effect, and to prevent, as far as possible, any injuries or losses which the parties to this cause, or either of them, may be liable to by the vessel and cargo continuing in their present situation, do therefore hereby command you forthwith to sell,' &c. 'and, after deducting the costs and charges, to bring the residue of the said moneys into court ready to abide the further order of this court.' This warrant was made returnable at a court of admiralty to be holden at the judge's chambers, on the 7th of January, 1779.\n Copies of the above order and warrant being produced, on the same 28th of December, 1778, before the court of appeals, it was moved, on the \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 122]\n\u00a0\n part of the appellants, Olmstead and others, that process might issue to the marshal of the admiralty of Pennsylvania, commanding him to execute the decree of the court of appeals; and after argument the case was postponed for further argument until Monday, 4th of January, 1779, at 5 o'clock P. M. On which day at 8 o'clock A. M. the court of appeals being again convened at the pressing instance and request of the claimants Olmstead and others, it was moved and suggested by their advocates that notwithstanding the decree of the court of appeals, which had been transmitted to the court of admiralty, the judge of that court had appointed the hour of nine on that morning for the marshal to pay into court the money arising from the sale of the sloop Active and cargo; which suggestion was supported by the oath of the registrar of the admiralty; whereupon it was prayed that an injunction might issue from the court of appeals directed to the marshal of the court of admiralty, commanding him to keep the money in his hands until the further order of the court of appeals; which injunction was accordingly granted, reciting the sentence of the court of admiralty and its reversal, and the decree by the court of appeals; the refusal of the judge of the court of admiralty to cause that decree to be executed; and the motion to the court of appeals for a writ to the marshal commanding him to execute the same; the continuance of that motion to the 4th of January, 1779, at 5 o'clock P. M. and the appointment of the hour of 9 o'clock A. M. of the same day, by the special order of the judge of the court of admiralty, for the marshal to pay the money into that court, whereby the effect of the writ prayed for, if the court should grant it, would be eluded.\n This injunction was served upon the marshal before he paid the money into the court of admiralty; but he disregarded it, and paid the money over to the judge, who gave a receipt for it.\n'Whereupon the court (of appeals) declared and ordered to be entered on record, that as the judge and marshal of the court of admiralty of the state \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 123]\n\u00a0\n of Pennsylvania had absolutely and respectively refused obedience to the decree and writ regularly made in and issued from this court, to which they and each of them were and was bound to pay obedience, this court being unwilling to enter upon any proceedings for contempt, lest consequences might ensue at this juncture dangerous to the public peace of the United States, will not proceed further in this affair, nor hear any appeal, until the authority of this court be so settled as to give full efficacy to their decrees and process.\n\n'Ordered that the register do prepare a state of the proceedings had upon the decree of this court, in the case of the sloop Active, in order that the commissioners may lay the same before congress.'\n\n Upon the writ issued by the judge commanding the marshal to sell the vessel and cargo, and bring the proceeds into court to abide its further order, the marshal, on the 4th of January, 1779, returned, that in obedience to that writ he had deposited in the court of admiralty 47,951l. 2s. 5d. Pennsylvania currency, on account of the cargo of the prize sloop Active; but that the sloop remained yet unsold.\n The money was loaned to the United States, and the loan-office certificates brought into court and deposited in the hands of the judge, who, on the 1st of May, 1779, delivered to David Rittenhouse, treasurer of the state of Pennsylvania, fifty of the certificates, amounting to 11,496l. 9s. 9d. 'being the share or dividend of the state in right of the brig Convention in and out of the prize sloop Active, according to the verdict of the jury on the trial of the said sloop Active in the admiralty court of that state;' at the same time taking a bond of indemnity from Mr. Rittenhouse, by the name of 'David Rittenhouse, of the city of Philadelphia, gent.' the condition of which was that 'Whereas the said George Ross hath this day paid to the said David Rittenhouse, treasurer of the state of Pennsylvania, for the use of the said state, the sum,' &c. Now 'if he the said David Rittenhouse shall make repayment \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 124]\n\u00a0\n and restitution of the said sum of 11,496l. 9s. 9d. unto the said George Ross, his executors or administrators, in case he the said George Ross shall hereafter by due course of law be compelled to pay the same according to the decree of the court of appeals in the case of the said sloop Active; and if he the said David Rittenhouse shall and do in all things well and truly save harmless and indemnified at all times hereafter the said George Ross, his heirs, executors and administrators, and his and their lands and tenements, goods and chattels of and from all damages, actions and demands which may arise or happen, for or on account of his having paid the money aforesaid, then the above obligation to be void, or else to be and remain in full force and virtue.'\n The certificates were afterwards funded in the name of David Rittenhouse, and among his papers was found a list of the old loan-office certificates, and of the new funded stock, at the foot of which was written, in the hand writing of Mr. Rittenhouse, the following memorandum:\n'Note. The above certificates will be the property of the state of Pennsylvania, when the state releases me from the bond I gave in 1778, to indemnify George Ross, Esq. judge of the admiralty, for paying the filty original certificates into the state treasury as the state's share of the prize.'\n\n In the year 1801, the legislature of Pennsylvania passed an act requiring the treasurer to call upon the executrixes of Mr. Rittenhouse for the certificates of stock, and to give them a bond of indemnity, but they refused to deliver, them up, being advised that they would not be safe in so doing.\n On the 4th of January, 1803, the judge of the district court for the district of Pennsylvania, pronounced the following final decree in the cause:\n'This is the long depending case of the sloop Active and cargo. It comes before me by libel \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 125]\n\u00a0\n filed against the executors of the late Mr. Rittenhouse, who received from George Ross, Esq. then judge of the state court of admiralty, the sums mentioned in the libel, which were invested in the certificates of stock as stated therein. Mr. Rittenhouse, on receiving these certificates, which were proceeds of the sales of the said sloop and cargo, gave a bond of indemnity to Mr. Ross, which is now offered, when payment of these proceeds in made, to be delivered up. The suit is instituted for the purpose of carrying into effect a decree of the court of appeals established under the old confederation, at copy whereof appears among the exhibits. In the answer it is alleged that the moneys were received for the state of Pennsylvania. In the replication this is denied. In a memorandum made by Mr. Rittenhouse, at the foot of the account exhibited, it appears that he intended to pay over these proceeds to the state, when indemnified. No such payment ever has been made, and the certificates and moneys are yet in the hands of the respondents.\n\n'It appears to me that Mr. Rittenhouse considered himself, as I conceive he was, a stakeholder, liable to pay over the deposit to those lawfully entitled thereto. His executors conceive themselves in the same predicament, and have declined paying over the certificates and interest. No counsel have appeared, and requested to be heard on the part of the respondents, and I am left to judge from the libel, answer, replication and exhibits which contain the state of the facts. If I should be though mistaken in the opinion I form on the subject, there is time and opportunity to appeal to a superior tribunal.\n\n'I throw out of the case all circumstances not immediately within my present view of the duty I have to perform. I have nothing to do with the original question, that has been decided by the court of appeals; nor does it appear to me essential for me to determine with what intentions Mr. Rittenhouse received the certificates. The fact of the \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 126]\n\u00a0\n certificates and interest being now in the hands of the respondents is granted by them in their answer. It has been determined by the supreme court of the United States that this court has power to effectuate the decrees of the late court of appeals in prize causes, and this court has, on several occasions, practised agreeably to that decision. There is no doubt in my mind (the authorities in the books being clear on this point) that the process and jurisdiction of this court will reach and extend over the proceeds of all ships, goods and articles taken as lawful prize, found within the district, and legally proceeded against therein. These proceeds are under the same legal disposition, and subject to the same responsibility, under whatever shape they may appear, as the original thing from which they were produced. It is conceded that the certificates and moneys in question are proceeds of the sloop and cargo in the libel mentioned. These were decreed to the libellants by the judgment of the late court of appeals. I am, therefore, of opinion, and accordingly decree, and finally adjudge and determine, that the certificates be transferred and delivered, and the interest moneys paid over by the respondents to the libellants, in execution of the judgment and decree of the court of appeals, as stated in the proceedings in this cause, with costs. I make it, however, a condition that the bond of indemnity be cancelled or delivered to the respondents, on their compliance with this decree.\n\n'Richard Peters.\n\n'January 14, 1803.'\n\n No further proceedings in this cause were had in the district court until the 18th of May, 1807, when, on motion of Mr. Lewis, in behalf of the libellants, Olmstead and others, the respondents were ruled to show cause by the next Friday why the decree pronounced in this cause should not be carried into execution; and the bond of indemnity referred to in the decree was filed in court ready to be delivered \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 127]\n\u00a0\n up, or cancelled, on compliance with the decree by the respondents.\n On the 29th of May, 1807, to which day the rule had been enlarged, the respondents appeared and suggested to the court,\n That after making the decree in this case, to wit, on the second day of April, A. D. 1803, the general assembly of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed an act, which was then approved by the governor of the said commonwealth, in the following words: 'An act relating to the claim of this commonwealth against Elizabeth Serjeant and Esther Waters, surviving executrixes of David Rittenhouse, Esq. deceased.'\n Whereas, by an act of congress for the erecting of tribunals competent to determine the propriety of captures during the late war between Great Britain and her then colonies, passed the 25th day of November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, it is enacted, in the fourth section thereof as follows, viz. 'That it be and is hereby recommended to the several legislatures in the United Colonies, as soon as possible to erect courts of justice, or give jurisdiction to the courts now in being for the purpose of determining concerning the captures to be made as aforesaid, and to provide that all trials in such case be had by a jury, under such qualifications as to the respective legislatures shall seem expedient;' and in the sixth section thereof as follows, viz. 'That in all cases an appeal shall be allowed to the congress, or to such person or persons as they shall appoint for the trial of appeals.'\n And whereas, by an act of the general assembly of Pennsylvania, passed the 9th of September, 1778, entitled, 'An act for establishing a court of admiralty,' appeals were allowed from the said court in all cases, unless from the determination or finding of the facts by a jury, which was under the provisions of that law to be without re-examination \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 128]\n\u00a0\n or appeal: And whereas, by a resolution of congress of the 15th of January, 1780, it was, among other things, declared, 'That trials in the court of appeals shall be according to the law of nations, and not by jury.'\n And whereas the British sloop Active, having been captured as prize on the high seas, in the month of September, 1778, and brought into the port of Philadelphia, and there libelled in the court of admiralty of the said state, held before George Ross, Esq. the then judge of the said court, on the 18th day of the said month of September: And whereas the libellants then and there against the said sloop Active, Gideon Urmstead or Olmstead, Artimus White, Aquilla Rumsdale and David Clark, who claimed the whole vessel and cargo as their exclusive prize; Thomas Houston, master of the brig Convention, a vessel of war belonging to Pennsylvania, who claimed a moiety of the said prize for the state of Pennsylvania, himself, and his crew; and James Josiah, master of the sloop Gerard, private vessel of war, who claimed one fourth part of the said prize for himself, his owners and crew: And whereas all the facts respecting the said capture being submitted to the said court of admiralty, and a jury then and there returned, empannelled and sworn, a general verdict was brought in by the said jury, which was confirmed by the court, whereby Gideon Olmstead, Artimus White, Aquilla Rumsdale and David Clark, became entitled to one fourth of the said prize; Thomas Houston, for himself and crew, became entitled to another fourth; the state of Pennsylvania, as owner of the vessel of war the Convention, to another fourth; and James Josiah, himself and owners and crew of the sloop Gerard, became entitled to the remaining one fourth part of the said prize: And whereas the said Gideon Olmstead, Artimus White, Aquilla Rumsdale and David Clark, being dissatisfied with the verdict and sentence aforesaid, did appeal from the said court of admiralty of Pennsylvania, unto the court or committee of appeals appointed as aforesaid under the \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 129]\n\u00a0\n authority of congress, notwithstanding the recommendation of congress aforesaid, of the 25th day of November, 1775, for the appointment of courts of admiralty in each of the then United Colonies, did expressly provide that all trials respecting capture should be had by a jury, and under such qualifications as to the respective legislatures should seem expedient, and notwithstanding the court of appeals did decide not by a jury, but by the usage of nations, and notwithstanding the law for establishing the court of admiralty of Pennsylvania did expressly take away the right of appeal where the facts were found and determined by the intervention of a jury, and notwithstanding the state was authorized at the time to make such qualification or provision, taking away the right of appeal in jury cases, by virtue of the recommendation of congress aforesaid, which allowed and recommended the said courts of admiralty to be established with a jury under such qualifications as to the respective legislatures should seem expedient: And whereas the said court of appeals of the United States, on the 15th day of December, 1778, did reverse the sentence of the court of admiralty aforesaid, and did decree the whole of the said prize to the appellants: And whereas the judge of the court of admiralty, to wit, George Ross aforesaid, did refuse obedience to the decree of reversal, and did direct Matthew Clarkson, then marshal of the said court, to pay part of the proceeds of the said prize, to the amount of 11,496l. 9s. 9d. Pennsylvania currency, for the use of the state of Pennsylvania, into the treasury of the state of Pennsylvania, whereof David Rittenhouse was then treasurer, taking a bond of indemnity from the said David Rittenhouse, as treasurer as aforesaid, to save him the said George Ross, his executors, administrators, &c. harmless from the consequences of such payment, which bond is dated the 1st day of May, 1779: And whereas the said George Ross dying, suit was brought against his executors in the court of common pleas of Lancaster county, by and on the part of the appellants before named for the money whereunto they pretended \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 130]\n\u00a0\n title by virtue of the decree aforesaid of the court of appeals reversing the sentence of the court of admiralty, whereof the said George Ross had been judge: And whereas it does not appear that the said David Rittenhouse had any notice or information, or was in any legal way apprized of, or made a party to, the said suit in the court of common pleas of Lancaster county, either in his personal capacity, or as treasurer of the state of Pennsylvania, so that judgment was obtained by default against the executors of the said George Ross without any knowledge of the said David Rittenhouse, or his being able to take any measures on behalf of himself or the state of Pennsylvania to prevent the same: And whereas, in consequence of the judgment so obtained in the said court of common pleas of Lancaster county, against the executors of the said George Ross, the said executors brought suit against the said David Rittenhouse, which, in the year one thousand, seven hundred and ninety-two, in the term of April of the same year, was heard and determined in the supreme court of Pennsylvania, (on a case stated for the opinion of the court, after verdict taken for the plaintiff, subject to that opinion,) by Thomas M'Kean, chief justice, and others, the judges of the said court, who, among other things thereunto relating, did decree and determine that the reversal, as before mentioned, had and made in the court of appeals, was contrary to the provisions of the act of congress recommending the establishment of courts of admiralty, and of the general assembly of the state of Pennsylvania, in their act for the establishment of the said court, and was extrajudicial, erroneous and void, and that the court of common pleas of the county of Lancaster was incompetent to carry into effect the decree of the court of appeals, and that the judge of the court of admiralty aforesaid, George Ross, was not liable to an action in a court of law for distributing money according to his decree, as judge of the said court: And whereas at the second session of the third congress of the United States, held at the city of Philadelphia, in the month of \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 131]\n\u00a0\n December, one thousand, seven hundred and ninety-three, it was proposed, as an amendment to the constitution of the United States, that the judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit, in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state, which, having been adopted by the requisite number of states, as appears by the communication to congress of the then president, John Adams, to this purpose, of January the eighth, one thousand, seven hundred and ninety-eight, did become a part of the constitution of the United States: And whereas, on the twenty-seventh day of May, one thousand, eight hundred and two, the said Gideon Olmstead, Artimus White, Aquilla Rumsdale and David Clark, by their attorney, William Lewis, Esq. did file a bill in the district court of the United States, at Philadelphia, for the district of Pennsylvania, before Richard Peters, judge of the said court, against Elizabeth Serjeant and Esther Waters, surviving executrixes of David Rittenhouse aforesaid, deceased, for the recovery of the moneys, with interest, so paid into the hands of the said David Rittenhouse by Matthew Clarkson, marshal of the admiralty court aforesaid, as proceeds of the prize, the brig Active so captured as aforesaid, and by the said David Rittenhouse and his executrixes aforesaid formerly and still retained: And whereas, in the answer of the said Elizabeth Serjeant and Esther Waters to the bill aforesaid, it sufficiently and substantially appears, that the said money was originally received by the said David Rittenhouse, and was by him detained, as treasurer of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which commonwealth was, and still is, interested in, and a claimant of, the same, under the decree of the said George Ross, as judge of the court of admiralty in manner as herein before stated: And whereas the said Richard Peters, judge of the said district court, on the bill, answer and replication so filed by and between the said Gideon Olmstead, Artimus White, Aquilla Rumsdale and David Clark, of the one part, against Elizabeth \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 132]\n\u00a0\n Serjeant and Esther Waters, executrixes as aforesaid, did, on the fourteenth day of January, one thousand, eight hundred and three, proceed to decree as follows, viz. 'This is the long depending case of the sloop Active and cargo,' &c. All which legal proceedings herein before stated, will more fully and at large appear on reference to the records of the respective courts wherein the same were had: Therefore it hath become necessary for the general assembly of Pennsylvania, as guardians of the rights and interests of this commonwealth, and to prevent any future infringements on the same, to declare, that the jurisdiction entertained by the court or committee of appeals, over the decree of George Ross, as judge of the court of admiralty of Pennsylvania, in the suit where the claimants of the brig Active, as prize, were the libellants, as herein before stated, was illegally usurped and exercised, in contradiction to the just rights of Pennsylvania, and the proper jurisdiction of the court of admiralty established as aforesaid, under the authority of this state, and that the reversal of the decree of the said George Ross, in that suit, was null and void; that the jurisdiction entertained by Richard Peters, judge of the district court aforesaid, in the suit of Gideon Olmstead, Artimus White, Aquilla Rumsdale and David Clark against Elizabeth Serjeant and Esther Waters, surviving executrixes of David Rittenhouse, deceased, was illegally usurped and exercised; that the rights of this commonwealth, as a claimant, and as the party substantially interested, in the said suit, though apparent on the face of the proceedings, were unfairly passed over and set aside; that the said David Rittenhouse was not and ought not to have been considered in the light of a mere stakeholder, but as the treasurer and agent of this commonwealth, and that the jurisdiction and decree of the said Richard Peters hereon were entertained and made in manifest opposition to, and violation of, the last amendment of the constitution of the United States herein before stated, and ought not to be supported or obeyed. Therefore,- \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 133]\n\u00a0\n Sect. 1. Be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in general assembly met, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, that the governor of this commonwealth be authorized, and he is hereby authorized and required, to direct the attorney-general of this commonwealth to apply without delay to Elizabeth Serjeant and Esther Waters, executrixes as aforesaid, and require them forthwith to pay into the treasury of this commonwealth, the moneys by them admitted to have been received in respect of the premises, in their answer to the bill so as aforesaid filed against them, in the district court of Pennsylvania, before Richard Peters, judge of the said court, without regard to the decree of the said Richard Peters herein, and in default thereof by the said Elizabeth Serjeant and Esther Waters, to direct the said attorney-general to bring suit in the name of the commonwealth, in the proper court of this commonwealth, against the said Elizabeth Serjeant and Esther Waters, for the moneys aforesaid, and proceed as speedily as the course of legal proceedings will permit, to enforce the recovery and payment thereof into the treasury of this commonwealth.\n Sect. 2. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the governor of this commonwealth be authorized and required, and he is hereby authorized and required, to protect the just rights of the state, in respect of the premises, by any further means and measures that he may deem necessary for the purpose, and also to protect the persons and properties of the said Elizabeth Serjeant and Esther Waters from any process whatever issued out of any-federal court in consequence of their obedience to the requisition, so as aforesaid directed to be made to them by the attorney-general of this commonwealth, and in the name of this commonwealth to give to the said Elizabeth Serjeant and Esther Waters a sufficient instrument of indemnification, in case of their payment of the moneys aforesaid, in compliance with this act, without suit brought \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 134]\n\u00a0\n against them on the part of this commonwealth for the recovery of the same.\n Simon Snyder, speaker of the house of representatives.\n Robert Whitehill, speaker of the senate.\n Approved, April 2, 1803.\n Thomas M'Kean, governor of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n That they, the defendants, being required by proper authority to pay into the treasury of the said commonwealth the moneys admitted to have been received as executrixes of David Rittenhouse, Esq. in manner aforesaid, did, on the 19th day of July, 1803, transfer to the treasurer of the commonwealth the certificates of stock abovementioned, and on the 29th of July, 1803, pay into the treasury of the commonwealth the moneys by them received as aforesaid, in obedience to the said act of the general assembly, and to the requisition made under it.\n The defendants respectfully further suggest, that the said certificates and money were received by their said testator, as the treasurer and officer of the said commonwealth, as appears by the bond of the said David Rittenhouse, given on the receipt thereof, filed in this court by the libellants, the 22d of May inst.; and that the same came to their hands, as his representatives, after such receipt: And, it being expressly insisted by the said act of the general assembly, that the said commonwealth had and has a right to the said certificates and money, and these defendants having, as aforesaid, obeyed the requisition of the said act, these defendants suggest that the said decree of this honourable court ought not to be executed, nor any process issued thereupon against them. \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 135]\n\u00a0\n The defendants respectfully further suggest that the said decree of this honourable court was pronounced, so far as respects the claims, rights and interests of the said commonwealth of Pennsylvania, ex parte, and without jurisdiction.\n John Serjeant, attorney for defendants.\n After this suggestion, nothing appears to have been done until the application to this court at February term, 1808, when the motion was made for a rule on the judge to show cause why a mandamus should not issue commanding him to issue an attachment, or other proper process, to enforce obedience to his sentence, as before mentioned.\n At this term, Rodney, (attorney-general,) Lewis, and F. S. Key, of counsel for Olmstead and others, submitted the return of the mandamus to the consideration of the court without argument.\n February 20.\n\n MARSHALL, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the court as follows:\n With great attention, and with serious concern, the court has considered the return made by the judge for the district of Pennsylvania to the mandamus directing him to execute the sentence pronounced by him in the case of Gideon Olmstead and others v. Rittenhouse's Executrixes, or to show cause for not so doing. The cause shown is an act of the legislature of Pennsylvania, passed subsequent to the rendition of his sentence. This act authorizes and requires the governor to demand, for the use of the state of Pennsylvania, the money which had been decreed to Gideon Olmstead and others; and which was in the hands of the executrixes of David Rittenhouse; and, in default of payment, to direct the attorney-general to institute a suit for the recovery thereof. This act further authorizes and requires the governor to use any further means he \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 136]\n\u00a0\n may think necessary for the protection of what it denominates 'the just rights of the state,' and also to protect the persons and properties of the said executrixes of David Rittenhouse, deceased, against any process whatever, issued out of any federal court in consequence of their obedience to the requisition of the said act.\n If the legislatures of the several states may, at will, annul the judgments of the courts of the United States, and destroy the rights acquired under those judgments, the constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery; and the nation is deprived of the means of enforcing its laws by the instrumentality of its own tribunals. So fatal a result must be deprecated by all; and the people of Pennsylvania, not less than the citizens of every other state, must feel a deep interest in resisting principles so destructive of the union, and in averting consequences so fatal to themselves.\n The act in question does not, in terms, assert the universal right of the state to interpose in every case whatever; but assigns, as a motive for its interposition in this particular case, that the sentence, the execution of which it prohibits, was rendered in a cause over which the federal courts have no jurisdiction.\n If the ultimate right to determine the jurisdiction of the courts of the union is placed by the constitution in the several state legislatures, then this act concludes the subject; but if that power necessarily resides in the supreme judicial tribunal of the nation, then the jurisdiction of the district court of Pennsylvania, over the case in which that jurisdiction was exercised, ought to be most deliberately examined; and the act of Pennsylvania, with whatever respect it may be considered, cannot be permitted to prejudice the question.\n In the early part of the war between the United States and Great Britain, Gideon Olmstead and \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 137]\n\u00a0\n others, citizens of Connecticut, who say they had been carried to Jamaica as prisoners, were employed as part of the crew of the sloop Active, bound from Jamaica to New-York, and laden with a cargo for the use of the British army in that place. On the voyage they seized the vessel, confined the captain, and sailed for Egg Harbour. In sight of that place, the Active was captured by the Convention, an armed ship belonging to the state of Pennsylvania, brought into port, libelled and condemned as prize to the captors. From this sentence Gideon Olmstead and others, who claimed the vessel and cargo, appealed to the court of appeals established by congress, by which tribunal the sentence of condemnation was reversed, the Active and her cargo condemned as prize to the claimants, and process was directed to issue out of the court of admiralty, commanding the marshal of that court to sell the said vessel and cargo, and to pay the net proceeds to the claimants.\n The mandate of the appellate court was produced in the inferior court, the judge of which admitted the general jurisdiction of the court established by congress, as an appellate court, but denied its power to control the verdict of a jury which had been rendered in favour of the captors, the officers and crew of the Convention; and therefore refused obedience to the mandate: but directed the marshal to make the sale, and, after deducting charges, to bring the residue of the money into court, subject to its future order.\n The claimants then applied to the judges of appeals, for an injunction to prohibit the marshal from paying the money, arising from the sales, into the court of admiralty; which was awarded, and served upon him: in contempt of which, on the 4th of January, 1778, he paid the money to the judge, who acknowledged the receipt thereof at the foot of the marshal's return.\n On the 1st of May, 1799, George Ross, the judge \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 138]\n\u00a0\n of the court of admiralty, delivered to David Rittenhouse, who was then treasurer of the state of Pennsylvania, the sum of 11,496l. 9s. 9d. in loan-office certificates; which was the proportion of the prize money to which that state would have been entitled, had the sentence of the court of admiralty remained in force. On the same day, David Rittenhouse executed a bond of indemnity to George Ross, in which, after reciting that the money was paid to him for the use of the state of Pennsylvania, he binds himself to repay the same, should the said George Ross be thereafter compelled, by due course of law, to pay that sum according to the decree of the court of appeals.\n These loan-office certificates were in the name of Matthew Clarkson, who was marshal of the court of admiralty, and were dated the 6th of November, 1778. Indents were issued on them to David Rittenhouse, and the whole principal and interest were afterwards funded by him, in his own name, under the act of congress making provision for the debt of the United States.\n Among the papers of David Rittenhouse was a memorandum, made by himself at the foot of a list of the certificates mentioned above, in these words: 'Note. The above certificates will be the property of the state of Pennsylvania, when the state releases me from the bond I gave in 1778, to indemnify George Ross, Esq. judge of the admiralty, for paying the 50 original certificates into the treasury, as the state's share of the prize.'\n The state did not release David Rittenhouse from the bond mentioned in this memorandum. These certificates remained in the private possession of David Rittenhouse, who drew the interest on them during his life, and after his death they remained in possession of his representatives; against whom the libel in this case was filed, for the purpose of carrying into execution the decree of the court of appeals. \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 139]\n\u00a0\n While this suit was depending, the state of Pennsylvania forbore to assert its title, and, in January, 1803, the court decreed in favour of the libellants; soon after which, the legislature passed the act which has been stated.\n It is contended that the federal courts were deprived of jurisdiction, in this cause, by that amendment of the constitution which exempts states from being sued in those courts by individuals. This amendment declares, 'that the judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit, in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.'\n The right of a state to assert, as plaintiff, any interest it may have in a subject, which forms the matter of controversy between individuals, in one of the courts of the United States, is not affected by this amendment; nor can it be so construed as to oust the court of its jurisdiction, should such claim be suggested. The amendment simply provides, that no suit shall be commenced or prosecuted against a state. The state cannot be made a defendant to a suit brought by an individual; but it remains the duty of the courts of the United States to decide all cases brought before them by citizens of one state against citizens of a different state, where a state is not necessarily a defendant. In this case, the suit was not instituted against the state or its treasurer, but against the executrixes of David Rittenhouse, for the proceeds of a vessel condemned in the court of admiralty, which were admitted to be in their possession. If these proceeds had been the actual property of Pennsylvania, however wrongfully acquired, the disclosure of that fact would have presented a case on which it was unnecessary to give an opinion; but it certainly can never be alleged, that a mere suggestion of title in a state to property, in possession of an individual, must arrest the proceedings of the court, and prevent their \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 140]\n\u00a0\n looking into the suggestion, and examining the validity of the title.\n If the suggestion in this case be examined, it is deemed perfectly clear that no title whatever to the certificates in question was vested in the estate of Pennsylvania.\n By the highest judicial authority of the nation it has been long since decided, that the court of appeals erected by congress had full authority to revise and correct the sentences of the courts of admiralty of the several states, in prize causes. That question, therefore, is at rest. Consequently, the decision of the court of appeals in this case annulled the sentence of the court of admiralty, and extinguished the interest of the state of Pennsylvania in the Active and her cargo, which was acquired by that sentence. The full right to that property was immediately vested in the claimants, who might rightfully pursue it, into whosesoever hands it might come. These certificates, in the hands, first, of Matthew Clarkson, the marshal, and afterwards of George Ross, the judge, of the court of admiralty, were the absolute property of the claimants. Nor did they change their character on coming into the possession of David Rittenhouse.\n Although Mr. Rittenhouse was treasurer of the state of Pennsylvania, and the bond of indemnity which he executed states the money to have been paid to him for the use of the state of Pennsylvania, it is apparent that he held them in his own right, until he should be completely indemnified by the state. The evidence to this point is conclusive. The original certificates do not appear to have been deposited in the state treasury, to have been designated in any manner as the property of the state, or to have been delivered over to the successor of David Rittenhouse. They remained in his possession. The indents, issued upon them for interest, were drawn by David Rittenhouse, and preserved with the original certificates. When funded as \n\n[9 U.S. 115, 141]\n\u00a0\n part of the debt of the United States, they were funded by David Rittenhouse, and the interest was drawn by him. The note made by himself at the foot of the list, which he preserved, as explanatory of the whole transaction, demonstrates that he held the certificates as security against the bond he had executed to George Ross; and that bond was obligatory, not on the state of Pennsylvania, but on David Rittenhouse, in his private capacity.\n These circumstances demonstrate, beyond the possibility of doubt, that the property, which represented the Active and her cargo, was is possession, not of the state of Pennsylvania, but of David Rittenhouse as an individual; after whose death it passed, like other property, to his representatives.\n Since, then, the state of Pennsylvania had neither possession of, nor right to, the property on which the sentence of the district court was pronounced, and since the suit was neither commenced nor prosecuted against that state, there remains no pretext for the allegation that the case is within that amendment of the constitution which has been cited; and, consequently, the state of Pennsylvania can possess no constitutional right to resist the legal process which may be directed in this cause.\n It will be readily conceived that the order which this court is enjoined to make by the high obligations of duty and of law, is not made without extreme regret at the necessity which has induced the application. But it is a solemn duty, and therefore must be performed. A peremptory mandamus must be awarded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] On Saturday, March 5th, 1808, upon the affidavit of Olmstead, a rule was granted that Judge Peters should show cause by the next Saturday, why a mandamus should not issue. On Saturday, March 12th, a letter was received by one of the counsel for Olmstead, from Judge Peters, acknowledging service of the rule; and stating that an act of the legislature of Pennsylvania had commanded the governor of that state to call out an armed force to prevent the execution of any process to enforce the performance of the sentence. That such being the state of things he should not direct process to issue unless he should be so ordered by this court; whereupon a mandamus nisi was granted, returnable at the next term.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
