States Supreme Court\nALEXANDER SPRUNT & SON, INC. v. UNITED STATES(1930)\nNo. 19\nArgued: Decided: April 14, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 249, 250]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Davis, of New York City, and R. C. Fulbright, of Houston, Tex., for appellants.\n Mr. J. Stanley Payne, of Washington, D. C., for appellee Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Albert L. Reed, of Dallas, Tex., for appellees Arkansas Cotton Trade Ass'n and others.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 249, 251]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission entered, on April 4, 1927, an order directed to the railroads operating in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana, which required them to remove, in a manner prescribed, undue prejudice and preference caused by their rates on cotton shipped from interior points to Houston and other ports on the Gulf of Mexico. Application of Rates on Cotton to Gulf Ports, 100 I. C. C. 159; Id., 123 I. C. C. 685. Two suits, under the Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, as amended by Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 220 (28 USCA  47), were promptly brought in the federal court for Southern Texas, to enjoin the enforcement of the order and to set it aside. The first suit was brought by Alexander Sprunt & Son, Inc., and others interested in cotton compresses and warehouses located at wharves on the water front. The second, by the Texas & New Orleans Railroad Company and other rail carriers. The two cases were, with the consent of the parties, ordered consolidated as a single cause with a single record. The consolidated case was heard by three judges. An interlocutory injunction issued. Upon final hearing, the District Court sustained the validity of the order; dissolved the injunction; and entered a decree dismissing the bills. 23 F.(2d) 874.\n None of the carriers appealed from the decree. Acquiescing in the decision of the District Court, and in the order of the Commission, the railroads promptly established the prescribed rate adjustment; and it is now in force. This appeal was taken by Alexander Sprunt & Son, Inc., and those shippers and associations of shippers which had joined below as coplaintiffs in the bill filed by it. No stay of the decree pending the appeal was granted or sought. And no railroad was made a party to the proceedings on the appeal. At the argument, this \n\n[281 U.S. 249, 252]\n\u00a0\n court raised the preliminary question whether there is any substantive ground for appeal by the shippers alone. In order to answer that question, a fuller statement is necessary of the matter in controversy before the commission and of the terms of the order entered by it.\n From interior points in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Arkansas to the several ports on the Gulf of Mexico there were on all the railroads two schedules of rates on cotton-the domestic or city-delivery rates and the export or ship side rates. The latter were, prior to the entry of the order complained of, 3 or 3.5 cents per 100 pounds higher than the former. All rates permit concentration and compression in transit and include free switching, to and from the warehouses and compresses. \n1\n Complaint was made that in applying these rates the railroads unjustly discriminated against other shippers and in favor of Alexander Sprunt & Son, Inc., and other owners of warehouses and compresses at the wharves, by applying the domestic rates on shipments to their plants of cotton intended for export or for transshipment by vessel coastwise. It was sought to justify this practice on the ground \n\n[281 U.S. 249, 253]\n\u00a0\n that the conditions which had led to charging the higher rate for export cotton were absent in the case of these water front plants.\n The difference of about 3.5 cents per 100 pounds between the domestic and the export rates is approximately equal to the cost of transporting the cotton, by dray or by switching, from uptown concentrating and high density compressing plants in the ports to ship side. This difference served to equalize rates as between the uptown plants and the interior plants. Louisiana Cotton, 46 I. C. C. 451; Galveston Commercial Ass'n v. Alabama & Vicksburg Ry. Co., 77 I. C. C. 388. In 1921, and later, warehouses and high density compressing plants were located at the water- front, almost within reach of the ship's tackle. From these plants, there was no need of local transportation, by dray or switching, to shipside. The lower domestic rates were accordingly applied on cotton shipped to them, even though intended for export.\n This practice gave to the water front plants an obvious advantage over those located up town in the ports and over those located in the interior. Widespread complaint of undue prejudice and preference led the Commission to institute, upon its own motion, a general investigation concerning the lawfulness of the practices of the carriers in connection with the application of the city-delivery and ship side rates, with a view to determining, among other things, 'whether any change should be made in existing tariff regulations or rates in order to avoid or remove such undue preference, if any, that results or may result in favor of said water-front shippers or localities.' 2 Practically all the railroads operating in the four southwestern states were made respondents to that proceeding. \n\n[281 U.S. 249, 254]\n\u00a0\n After extended hearings, the Commission found that the existing adjustment of rates to ports was unduly prejudicial to the warehouses and compresses uptown and in the interior; that it was unduly preferential of those at the water front; and that the rates should be readjused so that one rate would apply for all deliveries within the usual switching limits of the respective ports, except that the export rates should be made higher than the domestic rates by an amount equal to the wharfage. The Commission did not, at first, specify the particular rate adjustment to be established to accomplish the result directed. Without inquiring into the reasonableness of the rates, it stated that the equality of treatment might be effected by any readjustment which would preserve, but not increase, the carriers' revenues. 100 I. C. C. 159, 167. But upon reopening the proceeding, pursuant to petitions therefor, the Commission prescribed specifically what the rate adjustment should be. It fould that 'for the purposes of this case a fair and reasonable basis for equalizing the city-delivery and ship-side rates will be to increase the city- delivery rates 1 cent per 100 pounds and reduce the ship-side rates exclusive of wharf or pier terminal charges equivalent to 2 cents per 100 pounds, to the basis of the increased city-delivery rates.' 123 I. C. C. 685, 695.\n First. The appellants contend that there is no basis for the Commission's finding of undue prejudice and preference. We are of opinion that appellants have no standing, in their own right, to make this attack. In so far as the order directs elimination of the rate differential previously existing, it worsened the economic position of the appellants. It deprived them of an advantage over other competitors of almost 3.5 cents per hundred pounds. The enjoyment of this advantage gave them a distinct interest in the proceeding before the Commission under section 3 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  3). For, their competitive advan- \n\n[281 U.S. 249, 255]\n\u00a0\n tage was threatened. Having this interest, they were entitled to intervene in that administrative proceeding. And, if they did so, they became entitled under section 212 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  45a) to intervene, as of right, in any suit 'wherein is involved the validity' of the order entered by the Commission. \n3\n But that interest alone did not give them the right to maintain an independent suit, to vacate and set aside the order. Such a suit can be brought by a shipper only where a right of his own is alleged to have been violated by the order. And his independent right to relief is no greater where by intervention or otherwise he has become a party to the proceeding before the Commission or to a suit brought by a carrier. In the case at bar, the appellants have no independent right which is violated by the order to cease and desist. They are entitled as shippers only to reasonable service at reasonable rates and without unjust discrimination. If such service and rates are accorded them, they cannot complain of the rate or practice enjoyed by their competitors or of the retraction of a competitive advantage to which they are not otherwise entitled. The advantage which the appellants enjoyed under the former tariff was merely an incident of, and hence was dependent upon, the right, if any, of the carriers to maintain that tariff in force and their continuing desire to do so.\n Why the carriers filed the new rate structure now in force is no concern of the appellants. If the carriers had done so wholly of their own motion, obviously these shippers would have had no ground of complaint, before any tribunal, unless the new rates were unreasonable or unjust. If they were believed by the appellants to be so, a complaint before the Commission would be the appropriate remedy. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Abilene \n\n[281 U.S. 249, 256]\n\u00a0\n Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n, 27 S. Ct. 350, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075; United States v. Merchants' & Manufacturers' Traffic Association, \n242 U.S. 178\n 188, 37 S. Ct. 24; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Merchants' Elevator Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285, 295\n, 42 S. Ct. 477. The appellants' position is legally no different from what it would have been if the carriers had filed the rates freely, pursuant to an informal suggestion of the Commission or one of its members; or if the filing had been made by carriers voluntarily after complaint filed before the Commission, which had never reached a hearing, because the rate structure complained of was thus superseded. \n4\n The carriers who were respondents before the Commission filed the new rates, presumably because they now desire them. Nothing to the contrary is shown. So far as the carriers are concerned, it is as if the new rates had been filed wholly of their own accord and as if there had never been a controversy before the Commission. Since the appellants' economic advantage as shippers was an incident of the supposed right exercised by the carriers, the appellants cannot complain after the carriers are satisfied or prefer not to press their right, if any.\n Appellants' present position resembles in all essentials one which was put forward in Edward Hines Trustees v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 143, 147\n, 148 S. 44 S. Ct. 72, and United States v. Merchants' & Manufacturers' Traffic Association, \n242 \nU.S. 178, 188\n, 37 S. Ct. 24. There, as here, the plaintiffs were deprived by the order of the Commission of a competitive advantage. But the plaintiffs there, as here, were not \n\n[281 U.S. 249, 257]\n\u00a0\n subjected to or threatened with any legal wrong. And, since the carriers acquiesced in the order of the Commission, the plaintiffs could not maintain an independent action to annul the orders. Appellants' present position is unlike that of the plaintiffs in the cases relied upon. United States v. Village of Hubbard, \n266 \nU.S. 474\n, 45 S. Ct. 160; The Chicago Junction Case, \n246 \nU.S. 258\n, 44 S. Ct. 317; Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 557\n, 39 S. Ct. 375; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Diffenbaugh, \n222 \nU.S. 42\n, 32 S. Ct. 22. In each of those cases, an independent legal right of the plaintiff was affected by the order which it was sought to set aside. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Moreover, by the action of the carriers, the issue of undue prejudice and unjust preference, which had been passed upon by the Commission, has become moot. Compare United States v. Anchor Coal Co., \n279 \nU.S. 812\n, 49 S. Ct. 262. Most of the carriers never sought to annul the order. Those that joined in the suit to set it aside have since voluntarily severed themselves from the shippers who object \n\n[281 U.S. 249, 258]\n\u00a0\n to it. The fact that some carriers at one time protested is of no significance, among other reasons, because their protest may have been directed, not against that part of the order which commanded an equalization of rates, but against the particular figure at which equalization was ordered. \n6\n There is nothing to show that any carrier is now in sympathy with the appellants' attack on the order. A judgment in appellants' favor would be futile. It would not restore the appellants to the advantage previously enjoyed. If the Commission's order is set aside, the carriers would still be free to continue to equalize the rates; and for aught that appears would continue to do so.\n Second. Appellants complain of the order also on the ground that it authorized an increase in the local or domestic delivery rates without a hearing and findings as to the reasonableness of the level of either the old or the new rates. It is urged that section 15 of the act (49 USCA  15) does not authorize the Commission to fix the rates necessary to remove undue prejudice without such hearing and findings. But plainly appellants cannot, in their own right, be heard to complain in this suit of this part of the order. The Commission's first order left the carriers free to choose the method for the removal of the preference. Compare American Express Co. v. Caldwell, \n244 \nU.S. 617, 625\n, 37 S. Ct. 656; United States v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 515, 521\n, 44 S. Ct. 189. If the carriers had, of their own accord, adopted the plan later prescribed by the Commission, appellants could, obviously, not be heard to complain of the reasonableness of the rate adopted, except in a proceeding before the Commission instituted under sections 13 and 15 of the act (49 USCA  13, 15). For reasons which it is unnecessary to detail, the carriers were unable to agree upon a plan. They petitioned the \n\n[281 U.S. 249, 259]\n\u00a0\n Commission for help. In reopening the proceedings, the Commission notified the parties that one of the issues to be decided was 'what rates shall be established to comply with (its) findings and order.' The carriers have accepted the rate fixed by the Commission. In prescribing the rate, the Commission in no way prejudiced any pre-existing rights or remedies of the appellants. Any question as to the reasonableness of the level of the rate was expressly left open by the Commission. \n7\n It did not prescribe any rate as the minimum. If appellants are aggrieved by the level of the new rates, they still have their remedy before the Commission under sections 13 and 15 of the act.\n Third. The appellants urged a further objection. In order to avoid congestion in heavy traffic periods and undue detention of cars, shippers from uptown warehouses customarily deliver their cotton to ship side by dray or barge, in lieu of switching by the carriers; and they are paid allowances by the carriers for this substituted service. The Commission's first report stated: 'This finding is not to be construed as condemning the practice of the carriers of absorbing drayage charges in lieu of switching.' 100 I. C. C. 159, 167. In its second report, the Commission reaffirmed this position. But in response to questions raised by the carriers, it stated that no allowances could lawfully be made with respect to what it termed the 'intraplant' movement by hand truck, overhead trolley, etc., to ship side from warehouses and compresses on and adjacent to the wharves operated as part \n\n[281 U.S. 249, 260]\n\u00a0\n of such warehouses or compresses. \n8\n Appellants urge that this prohibition is arbitrary and should be enjoined.\n The question of these allowances was only incidentally raised in the proceedings before the Commission. It made no order with respect to them. The statements complained of appear only in the report and are not specifically referred to in the order. The Commission recognized the right of shippers to allowances for substituted transportation service furnished by them. It did not undertake to define what such services might be for all cases. Nor did it specifically refer to the services rendered by any of the appellants. Indeed, appellants insist that their warehouses or compresses are not operated as part of or in conjunction with the adjacent wharves or piers. If, under their contracts with carriers, the appellants perform services which properly should be performed by the carriers, the appellants are free to demand allowances therefor and to enforce their demands by appropriate proceedings before the Commission and in the courts. In such proceedings, specific issues will be presented and decided.\n The decree below dismissed the consolidated suit on the merits. As the matter, in so far as it relates to the bill filed by these appellants, has become moot since the decree was entered, the decree should be reversed, so far as it \n\n[281 U.S. 249, 261]\n\u00a0\n concerns appellants; and the District Court should be directed to dismiss their bill without costs. See United States v. Anchor Coal Co., \n279 \nU.S. 812\n, 49 S. Ct. 262. So far as concerns the carriers-no appeal having been taken by them-the decree entered below should stand.\n Reversed, with direction to dismiss.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE did not take part in this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cotton is usually ginned at country points and put in bales weighing 525 pounds with a density of 11 or 12 pounds per cubic foot. Before these bales can be dealt in on the cotton exchanges they must commonly go through two further processes. Concentration-for purposes of merchandising; that is, grading and assorting into lots of quality and quantity demanded by the ultimate purchasers. Compression-for purposes of transportation; that is, reducing the size of the bale by increasing its density, which, in order to secure favorable rail rates, must commonly be 22.5 pounds per cubic foot, and, in order to secure favorable vessel rates, must commonly be 32 founds per cubic foot. The former is called standard density; the latter, high density. Some concentration and high density compression plants are located at interior points. Many are located in the ports, at places remote from the water front, or the wharves. These are called uptown plants. Since 1921, several plants have been located at the water front, in close proximity to the vessels by which the cotton is shipped abroad or coastwise. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] With this general investigation, there was consolidated a formal complaint, Weatherford, Crump & Co. v. Abilene & Southern Ry. Co. et al., which had been filed earlier. 100 I. C. C. 159, note 1. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Originally the Commerce Court Act, June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 543; U. S.

One was against a carrier to recover allowances for substituted transportation facilities alleged to be due under section 15 of the act (49 USCA  15). The Interstate Commerce Commission was joined and its order prohibiting the allowances sought to be enjoined because the order would otherwise have constituted a defense to the suit. In the other action, interested carriers intervened as parties plaintiff and persisted in their effort to set aside the order. In Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. United States, the right under the last paragraph of section 4 of the act (49 USCA  4), not to pay increased rates except when due to reasons other than the elimination of water competition, was clearly the right of the shipper. In the Chicago Junction Case, the order violated the plaintiff's right under paragraph 2 of section 5 (49 USCA  5(2) to equal treatment; and the plaintiff, with those similarly situated, was the only person in interest against the order. In the Hubbard Case, the challenged order increasing rates was alleged to violate a contract between the plaintiff and the carrier, who, it was alleged, was not subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See 123 I.

No allowances may lawfully be made for these intraplant movements.' 123 I. C. C. 685, 696. \n\n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALPHA S. S. CORPORATION v. CAIN(1930)\nNo. 457\nArgued: Decided: May 26, 1930\n\n\n\n Mr. Carver W. Wolfe, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Vine H. Smith, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent was a seaman employed as a fireman on the American steamship Alpha navigating the high seas. The corporation petitioner owned and operated the vessel, and the other petitioners were in possession of her. Respondent sued petitioners in the federal court for the Southern District of New York to recover damages for personal injuries caused by an assault upon him by his superior, one Jackson, an assistant engineer in charge of the engine room. The complaint charged and the evidence was sufficient to warrant a finding that Jackson was authorized by defendants to direct plaintiff about his \n\n[281 U.S. 642, 643]\n\u00a0\n work and that, for the purpose of reprimanding him for tardiness and compelling him to work, Jackson struck plaintiff with a wrench and seriously injured him. That was the basis of fact upon which the jury under the charge of the court was authorized to find for plaintiff. The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff for $12,000, and the judgment thereon was affirmed in the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n That court expressed the opinion (35 F.(2d) 717, 721) that section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act, 46 U. S. C.,  688 (46 USCA  688), and the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U. S. C.,  51-59 (45 USCA  51-59), did not apply, and held defendants liable under the general maritime law without regard to these acts. But in Jamison v. Encarnaction, \n281 \nU.S. 635\n, 50 S. Ct. 440, 74 L. Ed. -, decided this day, we hold that such an assault is negligence within the meaning of section 1 of the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51), which is made available to seamen by section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act (46 USCA  688). The ruling in that case controls in this. We need not examine the grounds upon which the Circuit Court of Appeals put its decision.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","2":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALUMINUM CASTINGS CO. v. ROUTZAHN(1930)\nNo. 922\nArgued: Decided: November 24, 1930\n\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 92, 94]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John T. Scott, of Cleveland, Ohio, for petitioner.\n The Attorney General, and Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Providence R. I., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a manufacturer of metal castings, brought suit in the District Court for Northern Ohio to recover income and excess profits taxes assessed and paid for the calendar year 1917. Right to recover was asserted on the sole ground that a munitions tax levied under title 3 of the Revenue Act of 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 780 (sections 300-312), which became due and was paid by petitioner in 1917, was \n\n[282 U.S. 92, 95]\n\u00a0\n correctly deducted from gross income in petitioner's tax return for that year. The Commissioner, rejecting this contention, deducted the tax from gross income for 1916, the year when it accrued, see United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422\n, 46 S. Ct. 131, and collected a correspondingly increased income and profits tax for 1917, which is involved in the present suit.\n The District Court, finding that petitioner kept its books and filed its tax returns for 1916 and 1917 on the 'accrual basis,' gave judgment for the collector, 24 F.(2d) 230, which the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, 31 F.(2d) 669. Both courts held, on the authority of United States v. Anderson, supra, that, as the books were kept and returns made on the accrual basis, the munitions tax which accrued in 1916 could not be deducted in the return for 1917\n\n\n Petitioner's returns for 1916 and 1917 were made after the effective date of sections 12(a), 13(b), and 13(d) of the Revenue Act of 1916 ( chapter 463, 39 Stat. 767, 771). The act imposes a tax on net income and profits ascertained, as provided by section 12(a), by deducting from gross income expenses, interest, and taxes paid, and losses sustained, during the calendar year. Section 13(d) provides that: 'A corporation ... keeping accounts upon any basis other than that of actual receipts and disbursements, unless such other basis does not clearly reflect its income, may, subject to regulations made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, make its return upon the basis upon which its accounts are kept, in which case the tax shall be computed upon its income as so returned.'\n Petitioner, in response to an inquiry on the form for the 1916 return, stated that it was 'made on the basis of actual receipts and disbursements,' a statement which it repeated in the 1917 return with the qualification that 'bills and accounts payable and receivable are treated \n\n[282 U.S. 92, 96]\n\u00a0\n as receipts and disbursements.' In both returns, bills and accounts, payable and receivable, in fact were treated as actual receipts and disbursements; and both were based on inventories taken at the beginning and end of the taxable year. The munitions tax deducted in the 1917 return first appeared on the taxpayer' books in that year.\n Petitioner contends that its returns were made as 'cash receipts and disbursements' returns under section 12(a) and not under section 13(d), and that, since by section 12(a) taxes are required to be deducted only in the year when paid, its munitions tax was rightly deducted in the 1917 return. In support of this contention, it is pointed out that section 12(a) of the 1916 act does not differ materially from corresponding provisions of the Revenue Acts of 1909 and 1913 (Corporation Excise Tax Act of Aug. 5, 1909, c. 6,  38, 36 Stat. 11, 112; Corporation Income come Tax Act of Oct. 3, 1913, c. 16,  II, subdiv. G, 38 Stat. 114, 172), and as petitioner's returns for 1916 and 1917 would have been authorized under these earlier acts, and Treasury Regulations supplementing them, it is argued that petitioner's right to deduct taxes when paid was not altered by the addition to the revenue laws, in the 1916 act, of section 13(d), which, merely gave to the taxpayer an option, not availed of by petitioner, to make a return on the accrual basis.\n This argument is, in substance, that considered and rejected by the Court in United States v. Anderson, supra, 269 U. S. page 439, 46 S. Ct. 131. There, as here, the taxpayer's return for 1917 computed income on the basis of inventories and accrued items, payable and receivable, appearing on the taxpayer's books of account for that year, but deducted from gross income the munitions tax, paid in 1917, which had accrued the year before. The return, as made, would have been permissible under the Revenue Acts preceding that of 1916; but it was held that under that act the tax was required to be deducted in the year when it accrued. \n\n[282 U.S. 92, 97]\n\u00a0\n Section 12(a) of the 1916 act, like its prototypes in the earlier legislation, deals only with the deduction from gross income of amounts paid out or losses sustained. None of them, in terms, permitted the deduction of accounts payable or made any provision for the use of inventories in computing net income. Experience demonstrating that income derived from merchandising and manufacturing businesses could not be computed on the basis of receipts and disbursements alone, treasury regulations were promulgated requiring the use of inventories in proper cases, and permitting the deduction of accounts payable when accounts receivable were brought into the income account. Treasury Regulations 31, Dec. 3, 1909, under the Act of Aug. 5, 1909; 33, Jan. 5, 1914, under the Act of Oct. 3, 1913.\n But this action of the Department, born of necessity in order to arrive at the income of certain businesses, was neither a classification nor an irrevocable designation of items receivable and payable as cash receipts and disbursements. Although the regulations supplemented the provisions of the statute by providing for a different method of computing income, they did not alter the meaning of its words, or preclude acceptance of them at their face value when re-enacted in a new legislative setting. Classification took place when section 13(d) was substituted for existing treasury regulations,1 and broadly authorized returns under it by taxpayers 'keeping accounts upon any basis other than that of actual receipts and disbursements,' a phrase which, in the light of the legislative history, plainly indicates that the returns contemplated by section 13(d) were \n\n[282 U.S. 92, 98]\n\u00a0\n to be dealt with as a separate class, distinct from those based on actual receipts and disbursements alone described by section 12(a).2\n By these sections the filing of a return under section 13(b), where the taxpayer is able to comply with its requirements, is optional if he is also able to prepare a return on the basis of actual receipts and disbursements which reflects true income. But 'notwithstanding the option given taxpayers, it is the purpose of the Act to require returns that clearly reflect taxable income.' United States v. Mitchell, \n271 \nU.S. 9, 12\n, 46 S. Ct. 418, 419. By section 13(b) of the 1916 act, which was new, the return in every case is required to state such data as are 'appropriate and in the option of the commissioner necessary to determine the correctness of the net income returned and to carry out the provisions of this title.' It follows that the return must be filed on the accrual basis under section 13(d), where true income cannot be arrived at on the basis of actual receipts and disbursements. See United States v. Anderson, supra, 269 U. S. pages 437, 440, 46 S. Ct. 131. Any other construction of sections 12(a) and 13(d) would disregard the requirement of section 13(b) and the dominating purpose of the act, by enabling the taxpayer to file a return which did not reflect true income. See United States v. Mitchell, supra, 271 U. S. pages 12, 13, 46 S. Ct. 418. It was in recognition of this, and in compliance with section 13(b), that Treasury Decision 2433, Jan. 8, 1917, provided with respect to returns made under sections 12(a) and 13(d): \n\n[282 U.S. 92, 99]\n\u00a0\n 'This ruling contemplates that the income and authorized deductions shall e computed and accounted for on the same basis and that the same practice shall be consistently followed year after year.'\n This ruling antedated petitioner's 1916 and 1917 returns, and obviously gross income and deductions in its returns were not 'accounted for on the same basis.' Its income for 1917 could not be ascertained by deducting from gross income, including receivables, some items of cost and expense, attributable to the production of 1917 income, which accrued but were not paid in that year, and the munitions tax, which was paid in 1917 but which accrued and was attributable to the production of income in 1916.\n Petitioner, relying on the declarations in its returns that they were made on the basis of actual receipts and disbursements, contends that for that reason they must be deemed made under section 12(a) and not under section 13(d). But whether a return is made on the accrual basis, or on that of actual receipts and disbusements, is not determined by the label which the taxpayer chooses to place upon it. The use of inventories, and the inclusion in the returns of accrual items of receipts and disbursements appearing on petitioner's books, indicate the general and controlling character of the account, Niles Bement Pond Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 357, 360\n, 50 S. Ct. 251; United States v. Anderson, supra, 269 U. S. pages 442, 443, 46 S. Ct. 131, and support the finding of the trial court that books and returns were on the accrual basis. The record does not disclose that petitioner offered to make a return for 1917 on the basis of actual receipts and disbursements, or that it could have done so. It was, therefore, competent for the Commission to correct the return for 1917, to conform it to the system of accounting in fact adopted, by excluding from its the munitions tax which had accrued in 1916, whether appearing on the books for that year or not.

The petitioner made its return after the mode long approved by the Treasury Department and distinctly disavowed any purpose to accept the option granted by section 13(d).

Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422\n, 46 S.

It is true that there are differences in matters of fact between the present case and that case, but they seem to me not to be of a character to affect the pertinence of the Anderson decision and call for the application of a different rule. For that reason alone I concur in the opinion of the court just announced.

(28 USCA  47) resulted in a decree dismissing the bill; and a direct appeal has brought the case here. \n\n[281 U.S. 658, 663]\n\u00a0\n The proceeding which resulted in the order was instituted before the Commission December 27, 1926, by the California Growers' and Shippers' Protective League through a complaint assailing the existing rates as unjust and unreasonable under section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  1), unduly and unreasonably preferential under  3 of that act (49 USCA  3), and having an unjust and unreasonable basis, and being too high within the meaning of the joint resolution of Congress of January 30, 1925, known as the Hoch-Smith Resolution. The order was made July 20, 1927, and was changed by the Commission in some particulars November 14 of that year. Originally it was to be effective October 10, 1927, but the Commission extended the time to January 10, 1928\n\n\n The plaintiffs in the suit are the railroad companies which participate in the transportation. In their bill and on this appeal they challenge the validity of the order upon the ground, among others, that the Commission based it upon the joint resolution and a construction thereof which is inadmissible.\n The Interstate Commerce Act, Title 49, U. S. C. (49 USCA  1, 3 and 15) provides in sections 1, 3 and 15:\n Section 1, par. (5): 'All charges ... shall be just and reasonable, and every unjust and unreasonable charge ... is prohibited and declared to be unlawful. ...'\n Section 3, par. (1): 'It shall be unlawful ... to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever, or to subject any particular person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.'\n Section 15, par. (1): 'Whenever, after full hearing, upon a complaint ... or ... under an order for investigation and hearing made by the commission on its own \n\n[281 U.S. 658, 664]\n\u00a0\n initiative, ... the commission shall be of opinion that any individual or joint rate, fare, or charge whatsoever ... is or will be unjust or unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory or unduly preferential or prejudicial ... the commission is authorized and empowered to determine and prescribe what will be the just and reasonable individual or joint rate, fare, or charge, or rates, fares, or charges, to be thereafter observed in such case. ...'\n The joint resolution, c. 120, 43 Stat. 801 (49 USCA  55) reads:\n'That it is hereby declared to be the true policy in rate making to be pursued by the Interstate Commerce Commission in adjusting freight rates, that the conditions which at any given time prevail in our several industries should be considered in so far as it is legally possible to do so, to the end that commodities may freely move.\n\n'That the Interstate Commerce Commission is authorized and directed to make a thorough investigation of the rate structure of common carriers subject to the interstate commerce act, in order to determine to what extent and in what manner existing rates and charges may be unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, or unduly preferential, thereby imposing undue burdens, or giving undue advantage as between the various localities and parts of the country, the various classes of traffic, and the various classes and kinds of commodities, and to make, in accordance with law, such changes, adjustments, and redistribution of rates and charges as may be found necessary to correct any defects so found to exist. In making any such change, adjustment, or redistribution the commission shall give due regard, among other factors, to the general and comparative levels in market value of the various classes and kinds of commodities as indicated over a reasonable period of years to a natural and proper development of the country as a whole, and to the maintenance of an adequate system of transportation. In the progress of such investigation the commis- \n\n[281 U.S. 658, 665]\n\u00a0\n sion shall, from time to time, and as expeditiously as possible, make such decisions and orders as it may find to be necessary or appropriate upon the record then made in order to place the rates upon designated classes of traffic upon a just and reasonable basis with relation to other rates. Such investigation shall be conducted with due regard to other investigations or proceedings affecting rate adjustments which may be pending before the commission.\n\n'In view of the existing depression in agriculture, the commission is hereby directed to effect with the least practicable delay such lawful changes in the rate structure of the country as will promote the freedom of movement by common carriers of the products of agriculture affected by that depression, including livestock, at the lowest possible lawful rates compatible with the maintenance of adequate transportation service: Provided, That no investigation or proceeding resulting from the adoption of this resolution shall be permitted to delay the decision of cases now pending before the commission involving rates on products of agriculture, and that such cases shall be decided in accordance with this resolution.'\n\n The original and supplemental opinions of the commission show quite plainly that the commission based the order entirely upon the joint resolution. It is said in the opinions that 'the joint resolution was primarily relied upon' by the complainant; that, while a violation of section 3(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act was alleged in the complaint, 'no great reliance was placed upon that allegation'; that the 'primary issue to be determined' was whether the existing rates were in accord with the resolution; that the resolution effected a change 'in the basic law'; and that this change operated to eliminate a decision made June 25, 1925, in another proceeding between the same parties wherein the Commission found the same rates neither unreasonable nor unduly preferential and \n\n[281 U.S. 658, 666]\n\u00a0\n sustained them as lawful rates. California Growers' & Shippers' Protective League v. Southern Pacific Co., 100 I. C. C. 79. True, in both the original and supplemental opinions it is said that the existing rates are unreasonable, but the opinions taken as a whole show that this means the rates were deemed unreasonable under the joint resolution when construed as the Commission construed it, and not that they were deemed unreasonable under  1(5) or  3(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act. Throughout the opinions it is manifest that the Commission was testing the reasonableness and validity of the rates by considerations not applicable under those sections, but believed by it to have been brought into the problem by the resolution.\n The joint resolution is the outgrowth of several measures proposed in Congress but not adopted. Some of the measures may have been designed by their proposers to make real changes in existing laws relating to transportation rates. But they are not before us. The measure that is before us is the joint resolution which emerged from the legislative deliberations and proceedings. It is brought here to the end that we may determine its proper construction, which of course is to be done by applying to it the rules applicable to legislation in general.\n The question presented is whether the resolution changes the substantive provisions of existing laws relating to transportation rates, and particularly whether rates which would be lawful under those laws are made unlawful by it.\n The resolution is in three paragraphs. The first declares it be to a true policy in rate making that the conditions which at any given time prevail in the several industries 'should be considered' in so far as it is 'legally possible' to do so, to the end that commodities may move freely. This policy is not new. It rate making under existing laws it has been recognized that conditions in a particular industry may and should be considered along with other factors in fixing rates for that \n\n[281 U.S. 658, 667]\n\u00a0\n industry and in determining their reasonableness; and it also has been recognized that, so far as can be done with due regard for the interests affected, rates should be such as will permit the commodities to which they relate to move freely in the channels of commerce.\n The second paragraph is devoted chiefly to requiring the Commission to proceed along stated lines for the purpose of securing prompt observance of existing laws, such as sections 1(5) and 3(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 USCA  1(5), 3(1), requiring that all rates be just and reasonable, and prohibiting all undue preferences and unjust discriminations, whether relating to shippers, commodities, classes of traffic, or localities. The only substantive provision in the paragraph is one declaring that in the adjustment of rates the factors to be considered shall include (a) the general and comparative levels in marker value of the various classes and kinds of commodities as indicated over a reasonable period of years, (b) a natural and proper development of the country as a whole, and (c) the maintenance of an adequate system of transporation. These matters have all been regarded as factors requiring consideration under existing laws. The prohibition in section 3(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act of any undue preference of one locality over another always has been treated as intended to prevent the use of rates as a means of promoting the artificial development of one locality to the detriment of another. And what is said about the maintenance of an adequate system of transportation is but a reiteration of provisions embodied in existing laws.\n The third paragraph was construed by the Commission as making a change 'in the basic law,' as placing agricultural products in a 'most favored' class, and as justifying a reduction in the rates on deciduous fruits moving from California to Eastern points, notwithstanding most of the carriers 'have not as yet made the fair return,' for which section 15a of the Interstate Commerce Act as added by Transportation Act  422, 41 Stat. 488 (49 USCA  15a) \n\n[281 U.S. 658, 668]\n\u00a0\n makes provision as a means of securing the maintenance of an adequate transportation system. Indeed, it is apparent from the Commission's opinions that it regarded this paragraph as requiring it to condemn the existing rates as unreasonable and unlawful, although, had they been considered independently of the paragraph, they must have been upheld as reasonable and lawful under the applicable sections, 1(5) and 3(1), of the existing law.\n We are of opinion that the Commission's construction cannot be supported. The paragraph does not purport to make any change in the existing law, but on the contrary requires that that law be given effect. Nor does it purport to make unlawful any rate which under the existing law is a lawful rate, but on the contrary leaves the validity of the rate to be tested by that law.\n The paragraph requires only that 'lawful changes' in the rate structure be made; and we find in it no sanction for any other change. Unless the paragraph can be said to give its own definition of a lawful change, reference must be had to section 15, par. (1), 49 USCA  15(1), of the existing law which shows under what conditions and how a lawful change of rate may be effected by the Commission.\n The Commission stresses the concluding words in the same sentence with 'lawful changes,' and evidently regards them as qualifying the natural import of the latter and in effect specifying a new and reduced scale to be applied in rate making. The words stressed are, 'at the lowest possible lawful rates compatible with the maintenance of adequate transportation service.'\n Considering the connection in which these words are brought into the sentence, we think they fall much short of supporting the construction adopted by the Commission. They are more in the nature of a hopeful charac- \n\n[281 U.S. 658, 669]\n\u00a0\n terization of an object deemed desirable if, and in so far as, it may be attainable, than of a rule intended to control rate making. See United States v. New York Central R. R. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 603\n, 44 S. Ct. 212. Of course they should not lightly be disregarded. Neither should they lightly be accepted as overturning positive and unambiguous provisions constituting part of a system of laws reflecting a settled legislative policy, such as the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  1 et seq.) If they mean no more than that the depressed condition of the industry is to be given such consideration as may be reasonable, considering the nature and cost of the transportation service and the need for maintaining an adequate transportation system, they work no change in the existing law. But, if they mean more, and are intended to require that rates be reduced to some uncertain level below that standard, they give rise to a serious question respecting the constitutional validity of the paragraph of which they are a part. See Northern Pacific R. R. Co. v. North Dakota, \n236 \nU.S. 585, 595\n, 35 S. Ct. 429, L. R. A. 1917F, 1148, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 1; Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. Conley, \n236 \nU.S. 605, 608\n, 35 S. Ct. 437. By reason of their uncertain meaning, United States v. Barnes, \n222 \nU.S. 513, 520\n, 32 S. Ct. 117, and of the constitutional question which would be raised if they were taken as the Commission thinks they should be taken, Harriman v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n211 \nU.S. 407, 422\n, 29 S. Ct. 115, we think they must be held to work no substantial change in the meaning or operation of sections 1(5), 3(1), and 15, par. (1), of the existing law (49 USCA  1(5), 3(1) and 15(1).\n Our conclusion is that the order of the Commission was based upon an erroneous construction of the joint resolution, and therefore should have been set aside by the court below.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATCHISON, T. & S. F. RY. CO. v. TOOPS(1930)\nNo. 303\nArgued: Decided: April 14, 1930\n\n\n\n Messrs. William Osmond, of Great Bend, Kan., and William R. Smith and Alfred A. Scott, both of Topeka, Kan., for petitioner.\n Mr. Carr W. Taylor, of Hutchinson, Kan., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, plaintiff below, brought suit in the District Court of Reno county, Kan., to recover under the Federal Employers' Liability Act ( 45 USCA  51-59) for the death of her \n\n[281 U.S. 351, 352]\n\u00a0\n intestate. Judgment in her favor was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Kansas, 128 Kan. 189, 277 P. 57. This court granted certiorari October 21, 1929, on a petition which urged as grounds for allowance of the writ that there was no evidence of negligence in the case or that any act of petitioner caused the death.\n Decedent was a conductor in charge of petitioner's freight train, engaged in interstate commerce, while en route easterly from Elkhart to Dodge City, Kan. He was killed near the station at Rolla, Kan., at about 1 o'clock in the morning, in the course of a switching operation under his direction. At that point, north of the main line, and connected with it by switches, is a 'passing track' with an extension at its easterly end known as a 'stock track.' South of the station, which is south of the main line, is a switching track, referred to as an 'elevator track,' which forms a junction with the main line some three hundred feet or more east of the station platform.\n On the night of the accident two switching operations were to be carried out by deceased at Rolla. The first, which was successfully completed, consisted of removing four loaded grain cars from the elevator track and coupling them, deceased assisting, to the train standing west of the station on the main line. The second involved the removal of fifteen empty grain cars, coupled to twelve stock cars, from the passing and stock tracks to the main line, and thence 'kicking' the grain cars onto the elevator track, that is, the train of grain and stock cars was to be pushed by the engine westerly along the main line and the fifteen grain cars uncoupled from the westerly end of the stock cars while still in motion and before the stock cars had reached the switch to the elevator track, thus propelling the grain cars from the main line to the elevator track. The stock cars were then to be kicked back onto the passing track by a similar movement, after \n\n[281 U.S. 351, 353]\n\u00a0\n which the engine was to be coupled to the grain cars standing on the elevator track and they were to be spotted at desired locations on that track. Under the rules of petitioner, deceased was required to attend personally to these switching movements.\n There were no eyewitnesses to the accident. Deceased was last seen alive, standing, lantern and train book in hand, on the east end of the station platform. Plaintiff's own witnesses testified, without contradiction that shortly before one of the two brakemen of the train crew had read to the other and to deceased the switching list calling for the movement of the grain cars, and had then said that he would kick the cars onto the elevator track, to which deceased replied: 'All right I will look out for them.' After the grain cars had been kicked onto the elevator track and the stock cars onto the passing track, the engine was coupled to the grain cars and the spotting movement begun, when the body of the deceased was discovered. It was lying under the engine tender diagonally across the elevator track, with the shoulder against a 'derail' about one hundred and eighty feet west of the switch, connecting the elevator track with the main line, and about the same distance from the point on the platform where decedent had last been seen alive. His feet were toward the north, his head and arm had been severed from his body and lay just south of the track. His cap, lantern, and lead pencil were lying near, together, south of the elevator track two or three feet from the south rail. His train book was found lying in the center of the track between the rails. The surface of the track between the rails showed that his body, after it had fallen to the ground, had been moved or dragged westward two or three feet until his shoulders were jammed against the derail. There were no marks of flesh or blood on any part of the first grain car indicating that it had come into contact with the body of the deceased. There was uncontradicted testi- \n\n[281 U.S. 351, 354]\n\u00a0\n mony that such marks of flesh and blood were found upon the south wheels of each of the succeeding fourteen grain cars and the engine tender.\n It was controverted whether, within the meaning of printed rules of petitioner, the place of the accident was at a 'station' or in a 'yard.' The rules required that, when cars were pushed by an engine 'except when shifting or making up trains in yards,' a flagman should be placed on the front of the leading car so as to signal the engineer in case of need, and that a white light must be placed on the leading car at night. No flagman or brakeman and no light was placed on the leading grain car. Owing to the location of a curve and cut through which the grain cars passed in order to reach the elevator track, it was impossible for the engineer or the two brakemen to see deceased or his lantern at the point where his body was found. There was evidence that no warning signal by bell or whistle was given in the course of the kicking movement.\n It is the theory of the respondent, conforming to the findings of the jury in its special verdict, that deceased, while crossing the track near the derail, where, according to some of the testimony, the roadbed was overgrown with weeds and so thinly ballasted that the track had become 'skeletonized,' was knocked down by the leading grain car, and killed by that and the succeeding cars passing over him, and that his death was attributable to negligence in carrying out the kicking movement of the grain cars without signal and without placing a flagman or a light on them.\n But proof of negligence alone does not entitle the plaintiff to recover under the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The negligence complained of must be the cause of the injury. The jury may not be permitted to speculate as to its cause, and the case must be withdrawn from its consideration, unless there is evidence from which \n\n[281 U.S. 351, 355]\n\u00a0\n the inference may reasonably be drawn that the injury suffered was caused by the negligent act of the employer. Patton v. Texas & Pac. Ry. Co., \n179 \nU.S. 658\n, 21 S. Ct. 275; New Orleans & N. E. R. R. Co. v. Harris, \n247 \nU.S. 367, 371\n, 38 S. Ct. 535; St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co. v. Mills, \n271 \nU.S. 344, 347\n, 46 S. Ct. 520; Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. v. Coogan, \n271 \nU.S. 472\n, 46 S. Ct. 564; New York Central Railroad Co. v. Ambrose, \n280 \nU.S. 486\n, 50 S. Ct. 198, decided February 24, 1930\n\n\n Even though we assume that in all the respects alleged the petitioner was negligent, the record does not disclose any facts tending to show that the negligence was the cause of the injury and death. The only evidence relied upon by respondent to account for the deceased's presence at the point of the accident was that already stated, which indicated that he had proceeded to the elevator track in order, as he had said, to 'look out' for the kicked cars, whether by climbing onto them and controlling their movement on the elevator track, as is usual in such movements, or by assisting in the spotting movement to be later carried out, can only be inferred. It is the theory of respondent that he attempted to cross the track so as to be in a position to signal the engineer who was on that side of the train. But, as the grain cars already were, or about to be, uncoupled from the train, there was evidently no immediate purpose in his being so located. What actually took place can only be surmised. Whether he was run down on the track by the first car, or he attempted unsuccessfully to board the train on one side or the other or succeeded, and in either case finally came to his death by falling under or between the moving cars is a matter of guesswork.\n Even though we make the doubtful assumption that the train was not within a 'yard,' and so was required to signal its movements, it is plain that deceased and his train crew treated the place as a yard where warning of switching movements was not required. On respondent's own theory, deceased was fully cognizant of the \n\n[281 U.S. 351, 356]\n\u00a0\n contemplated movement. He knew that the grain cars were to be kicked onto the elevator track where he went to meet them, and knew that train crew, consisting of only two brakemen and the lanterns which they carried, would be needed in attending to the switching, signalling, and uncoupling of cars in order to kick the train of stock cars onto the passing track, and that the grain cars for which he was to 'look out' would be without brakeman or warning light. It is presumed that deceased proceeded with diligence and due care. Looney v. Metropolitan R. R. Co., \n200 \nU.S. 480, 488\n, 26 S. Ct. 303. The movement of the fifteen cars to and across the switch and onto the elevator track in a quiet neighborhood on a still night cannot be assumed to have given no warning sounds of their approach.\n All these factors, taken together, render highly improbable the theory of respondent that deceased was run down by the grain cars while he was crossing or standing upon the track, and they give sharp emphasis to the absence of any proof of the fact, indispsensable to respondent's case, that deceased, while standing on or attempting to cross the track, was struck by the leading car. There is no evidence to suggest that the body, after falling to the ground, was moved or dragged more than two or three feet. There were no marks of blood or flesh of the decedent upon any part of the leading car, although such marks were found on most, if not all, of the cars following. The kicked grain cars were moving slowly when they passed the switch to the elevator track as they came to a stop two or three car lengths west of the derail. It is true that there was medical testimony that in the case of crushing injuries bleeding might not immediately ensue, but the length of this period of delay was not mentioned, and the testimony given was not stated by any witness to be applicable to injuries of the extent and character suffered by the deceased. It does not account \n\n[281 U.S. 351, 357]\n\u00a0\n for the absence from the leading car of the other evidences of the injury found on the other cars. As evidence to support the special finding of the jury that the deceased was struck by the first car, this testimony is without substance. See Gulf, Mobile & Northern R. R. v. Wells, \n275 \nU.S. 455\n, 48 S. Ct. 151. If allowed to sustain the verdict, it would remove trial by jury from the realm of probability, based on evidence, to that of surmise and conjecture.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","5":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALDWIN v. STATE OF MISSOURI(1930)\nNo. 417\nArgued: April 23, 1930Decided: May 26, 1930\n\n\n\n Credits involved were for cash deposited with several Missouri banks, and there were coupon bonds issued by the United States and numerous promissory notes, most of which were executed by citizens of Missouri and secured by liens upon lands located within that state. The state of Missouri sought to tax this property lying physically within its limits, but the decedent resided in Illinois, and the transfer was taxed in that state.\n Messrs. Harry Carstarphen, of Hannibal, Mo., and John F. Garner, of Quincy, Ill., for plaintiffs in error and appellants. \n\n[281 U.S. 586, 587]\n\u00a0\n Messrs, Stratton Shartel and A. M. Meyer, both of Jefferson City, Mo., for State of Missouri. Missouri.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 586, 588]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The validity of section 558, R. S. of Missouri. 1919, was duly challenged in the court below; by the judgment there the rights of the parties were finally determined; the cause is properly here on appeal.\n While a resident of Quincy, Adams county, Ill., Carrie Pool Baldwin died October 4, 1926. By will she left all her property to Thomas A. Baldwin, her son, a resident of the same place, and appointed him sole executor. The will was duly probated at her residence, and under the statute of Illinois an inheritance tax was there laid upon the value of all her intangible personalty, wherever situated.\n Ancillary letters of administration with the will annexed issued out of the probate court of Lewis county, Mo., to Harry Carstarphen, October 22, 1926. A report to that court revealed that at the time of her death Mrs. Baldwin owned real estate in Missouri; credits for cash deposited with two or more banks located there; also certain coupon bonds issued by the United \n\n[281 U.S. 586, 589]\n\u00a0\n States and sundry promissory notes which were then physically within that state. Most of these notes were executed by citizens of Missouri, and the larger part were secured by liens upon lands lying therein.\n Under section 558, R. S. 19191 (copied in margin) the state of Missouri demanded transfer or inheritance taxes reckoned upon the value of all the above described property. No denial of this claim was made in respect of the real estate; but as to the personalty it was resisted upon the ground that the property was not within the jurisdiction of the state for taxation purposes and to enforce the demand would violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[281 U.S. 586, 590]\n\u00a0\n The Lewis county circuit court declared the transfer of the personal property not subject to taxation; the Supreme Court reached a different conclusion and directed payment.\n It does not appear and is not claimed that either the decedent or her son ever resided in Missouri. The record discloses nothing tending to show that the personal property had been given a business situs in that state.\n Among other things, the Supreme Court (19 S.W.(2d) 732, 734) said:\n'In recent cases we have held, for the purpose of property tax, that the situs of a credit is the domicile of the creditor ....\n\n'If we could apply the same rule to an inheritance tax, we might have less difficulty in disposing of this case. The inheritance tax statute, article 21, c. 1, ... R. S. 1919, provides an entirely independent method of ascertaining the property subject to inheritance tax from that applicable for general tax. The definition of the term 'property' in the last section, 589, of that article, makes inapplicable any definition relating to general property tax. An inheritance tax is not a property tax, but an excise tax, or a tax upon succession. In re Zook's Estate, 317 Mo. 986, 296 S. W. loc. cit. 780, and cases cited. ...\n\n'These notes, bonds, and cash were all in the possession of the administrator in Missouri. For what purpose they were in Missouri is not shown. We cannot assume that they were in the state of Missouri for the purpose of escaping taxation in the state of Illinois. It is a reasonable inference that the cash and notes in such large quantities in Missouri, when none of it was held in Illinois, was retained in this state for the purpose of investment . They may have established a business situs in this state, in which case it would be subject to a general tax, as well as the inheritance tax. ...\n\n'It (the personalty) possibly acquired a business situs in this state. Whether it did or not, it was within the \n\n[281 U.S. 586, 591]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction of the state, and property subject to the transfer tax. It would have been a proper subject of inquiry by the trial court to determine how and why and under what conditions these evidences of debt were in this state, but, whatever the determination of that question, the property was leaglly within the jurisdiction of the probate court of Lewis county in this state, and subject to the tax.'\n\n The challenged judgment rests upon the broad theory that a state may lay succession or inheritance taxes measured by the value of any deposits in local banks passing from a nonresident decedent; also upon the value of bonds issued by the United States and promissory notes executed by individual citizens of the state when devised by such nonresident if these bonds or notes happen to be found within the confines of the state when death occurs. The cause was decided below prior to our determination of Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204\n, 50 S. Ct. 98, 74 L . Ed. 371. Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189\n, 23 S. Ct. 277, was cited in support of the conclusion reached. Considering Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota and previous opinions there referred to, the theory upon which the court below proceeded is untenable, and its judgment must be reversed.\n Ordinarily, bank deposits are mere credits, and for purposes of ad valorem taxation have situs at the domicile of the creditor only. The same general rule applies to negotiable bonds and notes whether secured by liens on real estate or otherwise.\n In Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, \n100 \nU.S. 491, 498\n, 499 S., this Court declared:\n'Plainly, therefore, our only duty is to inquire whether the Constitution prohibits a State from taxing, in the hands of one of its resident citizens, a debt held by him upon a resident of another State, and evidenced by the bond of the debtor, secured by deed of trust or mortgage \n\n[281 U.S. 586, 592]\n\u00a0\n upon real estate situated in the State in which the debtor resides.\n\n'The question does not seem to us to be very difficult of solution. The creditor, it is conceded, is a permanent resident within the jurisdiction of the State imposing the tax. The debt is property in his hands constituting a portion of his wealth, from which he is under the highest obligation, in common with his fellow-citizens of the same State, to contribute for the support of the government whose protection he enjoys.\n\n'That debt, although a species of intangible property, may, for purposes of taxation, if not for all others, be regarded as situated at the domicile of the creditor. It is none the less property because its amount and maturity are set forth in a bond. That bond, wherever actually held or deposited, is only evidence of the debt, and if destroyed, the debt-the right to demand payment of the money loaned, with the stipulated interest-remains. Nor is the debt, for the purposes of taxation, affected by the fact that it is secured by mortgage upon real estate situated in Illinois. The mortgage is but a security for the debt, and, as held in State Tax on Foreign-held Bonds, supra (15 Wall. 300), the right of the creditor 'to proceed against the property mortgaged, upon a given contingency, to enforce by its sale the payment of his demand ... has no locality independent of the party in whom it resides. It may undoubtedly be taxed by the State when held by a resident therein,' etc. Cooley on Taxation, 15, 63, 134, 270. The debt, then, having its situs at the creditor's residence, both he and it are, for the purposes of taxation, within the jurisdiction of the State.'\n\n And in Blodgett v Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 48 S. Ct. 410, 415:\n'The question here is whether bonds, unlike other choses in action, may have a situs different, from the owner's domicile such as will render their transfer taxable in the state of that situs and in only that state. We think \n\n[281 U.S. 586, 593]\n\u00a0\n bonds are not thus distinguishable from other choses in action. It is not enough to show that the written or printed evidence of ownership may, by the law of the state in which they are physically present, be permitted to be taken in execution or dealt with as reaching that of which they are evidence, even without the presence of the owner . While bonds often are so treated, they are nevertheless in their essence only evidences of debt. The Supreme Court of Errors expressly admits that they are choses in action. Whatever incidental qualities may be added by usage of business or by statutory provision, this characteristic remains, and shows itself by the fact that their destruction physically will not destroy the debt which they represent. They are representative, and not the thing itself.'\n\n We find nothing to exempt the effort to tax the transfer of the deposits in Missouri banks from the principle applied in Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, supr a. So far as disclosed by the record, the situs of the credit was in Illinois where the depositor had her domicile. There the property interest in the credit passed under her will; and there the transfer was actually taxed. This passing was properly taxable at that place, and not otherwhere.\n The bonds and notes, although physically within Missouri, under our former opinions were choses in action with situs at the domicile of the creditor. At that point they, too, passed from the dead to the living, and there this transfer was actually taxed . As they were not within Missouri for taxation purposes, the transfer was not subject to her power. Rhode Island Trust Co. v. Doughton, \n270 \nU.S. 69\n, 46 S. Ct. 256, 43 A. L. R . 1374\n\n\n It has been suggested that, should the state of the domicile be unable to enforce collection of the tax laid by it upon the transfer, then in practice all taxation thereon might be evaded. The inference seems to be that \n\n[281 U.S. 586, 594]\n\u00a0\n double taxation-by two states on the same transfer-should be sustained in order to prevent escape from liability in exceptional cases. We cannot assent. In Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 230, 240\n, 46 S. Ct. 260, 261, 43 A. L. R. 1224 Y, a similar notion was rejected.\n'The presumption and consequent taxation are defended upon the theory that, exercising judgment and discretion, the Legislature found them necessary in order to prevent evasion of inheritance taxes. That is to say, A. may be required to submit to an exactment forbidden by the Constitution if this seems necessary in order to enable the state readily to collect lawful charges against B. Rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution are not to be so lightly treated; they are superior to this supposed necessity. The state is forbidden to deny due process of law or the equal protection of the laws for any purpose whatsoever.'\n\n If the possibility of evasion be considered from a practical standpoint, then the Federal Estate Tax Law, under which credit is only allowed where a tax is paid to the state, section 1093, Title 26, U. S. C. ( 26 USCA  1093) must be given due weight. Also the significance of the adoption of reciprocal exemption laws by most of the states, Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, supra, cannot be disregarded.\n Normally, as in the present instance, the state of the domicile enforces its own tax, and we need not now consider the possibility of establishing a situs in another state by one who should undertake to arrange for succession there and thus defeat the collection of the death duties prescribed at his domicile.\n This cause does not involve the right of a state to tax either the interest which a mortgagee as such may have in lands lying therein, or the transfer of that interest.\n Reversed. The cause will be remanded to the Supreme Court of Missouri for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n[281 U.S. 586, 595]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n Although this decision hardly can be called a surprise after Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204\n, 50 S. Ct. 98, and Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia, \n280 \nU.S. 83\n, 50 S. Ct. 59, and althought I stated my views in those cases, still as the term is not over I think it legitimate to add one or two reflections to what I have said before. I have not yet adequately expressed the more than anxiety that I feel at the ever increasing scope given to the Fourteenth Amendment in cutting down what I believe to be the constitutional rights of the States. As the decisions now stand I see hardly any limit but the sky to the invalidating of those rights if they happen to strike a majority of this Court as for any reason undesirable. I cannot believe that the Amendment was intended to give us carte blanche to embody our economic or moral beliefs in its prohibitions. Yet I can think of no narrower reason that seems to me to justify the present and the earlier decisions to which I have referred. Of course the words 'due process of law' if taken in their literal meaning have no application to this case; and while it is too late t deny that they have been given a much more extended and artificial signification, still we ought to remember the great caution shown by the Constitution in limiting the power of the States, and should be slow to construe the clause in the Fourteenth Amendment as committing to the Court, with no guide but the Court's own discretion, the validity of whatever laws the States may pass. In this case the bonds, notes and bank accounts were within the power and received the protection of the State of Missouri; the notes so far as appears were within the considerations that I offered in the earlier decisions mentioned, so that logically Missouri was justified in demanding a quid pro quo; the practice of taxation in such circumstances I think has been ancient and widespread, \n\n[281 U.S. 586, 596]\n\u00a0\n and the tax was warranted by decisions of this Court. Liverpool & London & Globe Ins. Co. v. Assessors for the Parish of Orleans, \n221 \nU.S. 346, 354\n, 355 S., 31 S. Ct. 550, L. R. A. 1915C, 903; Wheeler v. Sohmer, \n233 \nU.S. 434\n, 34 S. Ct. 607. (I suppose that these cases and many others now join Blackstone v. Miller on the Index Expurgatorius- but we need an authoritative list.) It seems to me to be exceeding our powers to declare such a tax a denial of due process of law.\n And what are the grounds? Simply so far as I can see that it is disagreeable to a bondowner to be taxed in two places. Very probably it might be good policy to restrict taxation to a single place, and perhaps the technical conception of domicil may be the best determinant. But it seems to me that if that result is to be reached it should be reached through understanding among the States, by uniform legislation or otherwise, not by evoking a constitutional prohibition from the void of 'due process of law' when logic, tradition and authority have united to declare the right of the State to lay the now prohibited tax.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE agree with this opinion.\n\n Opinion of Mr. Justice STONE.\n I agree with what Mr. Justice HOLMES has said, but as I concurred, on special grounds, with the result in Farmers' Loan & Trust Company v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204\n, 50 S. Ct. 98, and Safe Deposit & Trust Company v. Virginia, \n280 \nU.S. 83\n, 50 S. Ct. 59, I would say a word of the application now given to those precedents. I do not think that the overturning of one conclusion in Blackstone v. Miller by those cases should be deemed to carry with it Scottish Union & National Insurance Co. v. Bowland, \n196 \nU.S. 611\n, 25 S. Ct. 345, 49 L. Ed . 619, Wheeler v. Sohmer, 233 U . S. 434, 34 S. Ct. 607, upholding a tax measured by a nonresident's bonds and notes, located within the taxing \n\n[281 U.S. 586, 597]\n\u00a0\n state; Savings Society v. Multnomah County, \n169 \nU.S. 421\n, 18 S. Ct. 392, upholding a tax measured by a nonresident's notes, secured by mortgages on land within the taxing state; or Bristol v. Washington County, \n177 \nU.S. 133\n, 20 S. Ct. 585, and Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. New Orleans, \n205 \nU.S. 395\n, 27 S. Ct. 499, upholding a tax upon intangibles having a 'business situs' within the taxing state, but owned by a nonresident. These cases rest upon principles other than those applied in Blackstone v. Miller and are not dependent upon if for support.\n It is true that the bonds and notes located in Missouri are choses in action, rights in which may be transferred at the domicile of the owner as well as in any other state in which he may chance to be. But the transfer made there is not completely effected without their delivery, which ordinarily can be compelled only in Missouri and in accordance with its laws. If negotiable, which so far as appears some of them were, their transfer by delivery within Missouri could defeat the transfer made in Illinois. When secured by mortgage on real estate, the transfer of the security, which is an inseparable incident of the chose in action, Carpenter v. Longan, 16 Wall. 271; Lipscomb v. Talbott, 243 Mo. 1, 31, 147 S. W. 798, may be affected by the recording laws, availed of only through the recording facilities where the land is located. See Pickett v. Barron, 29 Barb. 505; Curtis v. Moore, 152 N. Y. 159, 163, 46 N. E. 168, 57 Am. St. Rep. 506.\n These circumstances, I think, are sufficient to give the jurisdiction which I thought lacking in Farmers' Loan & Trust Company v. Minnesota, to tax the transfer in Missouri, see Hatch v . Reardon, \n204 \nU.S. 152\n, 27 S. Ct. 188, 9 Ann. Cas. 736, and Rogers v. Hennepin County, \n240 \nU.S. 184\n, 36 S. Ct. 265; to say nothing of the further fact that Missouri laws alone protect the physical notes and bonds and the security located there. Apart from the question of jurisdiction, that one must pay a tax in two places, reaching the same economic interest, with respect to which he has sought and secured the bene- \n\n[281 U.S. 586, 598]\n\u00a0\n fit of the laws of both, does not seem to me so oppressive or arbitrary as to infringe constitutional limitations.\n Taxation is a practical matter, and if, in the choice of the rule we adopt, we may, as the Court has said in Farmers' Loan & Trust Company v. Minnesota, give some consideration to its practical effect, we ought not, I think, to overturn long-established rules governing the constitutional power to tax, without some consideration of the necessity and of all consequences of the change. Under the law as it has been, no one need subject himself to double taxation by keeping his securities in a state different from his domicile or by seeking the protection of its laws for his mortgage investments. But it is a practical consideration of some moment that taxation becomes increasingly difficult if the securities of a non-resident may not be taxed where located, and where alone they may be reached, but where the courts are not open to the tax gatherers of the domicile . See Moore v. Mitchell, No. 79, decided February 24, 1930, \n281 \nU.S. 18\n, 50 S. Ct, 175, 74 L. Ed. -; Id. (C. C. A.) 30 F.(2d) 600; Colorado v. Harbeck, 232 N. Y. 71, 133 N. E. 357.\n It is said that the present record discloses nothing tending to show that the decedent's personal property had been given a business situs in Missouri. The Supreme Court of Missouri (19  .W.(2d) 732, 734) said: 'It is a reasonable inference that the cash and notes in such large quantities in Missouri, when none of it was held in Illinois, was retained in this state for the purpose of investment. They may have established a business situs in this state. ...'\n The burden is not on the state to establish the constitutionality of its laws, nor are we limited in supporting their constitutionality to the reasons assigned by the state court . I do not assume, from anything that has been said in this or the earlier cases, that constitutional power to tax the transfer of notes and bonds at their business situs, no longer exists. As this Court has often held, the burden rests upon him who assails a statute to \n\n[281 U.S. 586, 599]\n\u00a0\n establish its unconstitutionality. Upon this ambiguous record it is for the appellant to show that the stock and bonds subjected to the tax had no business situs within the taxing jurisdiction. See No. 454, Corporation Commission of Oklahoma v. Lowe, \n281 \nU.S. 431\n, 50 S. Ct. 397, 74 L. Ed. -, decided May 19, 1930, No. 485, Toombs v. Citizens Bank of Waynesboro, \n281 \nU.S. 643\n, 50 S. Ct. 434, 74 L. Ed. -, decided this day.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS join in this opinion . \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 558, Revised Statutes of Missouri, 1919, Chapter 1, Article XXI:\n'A tax shall be and is hereby imposed upon the transfer of any property, real, personal or mixed or any interest therein or income therefrom, in trust or otherwise, to persons, institutions, associations, or corporation, not hereinafter exempted, in the following cases: When the transfer is by will or by the intestate laws of this state from any person dying possessed of the property while a resident of the state. When the transfer is by will, or intestate law of property within the state or within the jurisdiction of the state and decedent was a non-resident of the state at the time of his death. When the transfer is made by a resident or by a non-resident when such non-resident's property is within this state, or within its jurisdiction, by deed, grant, bargain, sale or gift made in contemplation of the death of grantor, vendor or donor, or intending to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after such death. Every transfer by deed, grant, bargain, sale or gift made within two years prior to the death of grantor, vendor or donor, of a material part of his estate or in the nature of a final disposition or distribution thereof without an adequate valuable consideration shall be construed to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this section. Such tax shall be imposed when any person, association, institution or corporation actually comes into the possession and enjoyment of the property, interest therein, or income therefrom, whether the transfer thereof is made before or after the passage of this act: Provided, that property which is actually vested in such persons or corporations before this act takes effect shall not be subject to the tax.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","6":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALTIMORE & O.S.W.R. CO. v. CARROLL(1930)\nNo. 87\nArgued: January 15, 1930Decided: February 24, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 491, 492]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William A. Eggers, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Mr. Oscar H. Montgomery, of Seymour, Ind., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 491, 493]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The deceased, Guerney O. Burtch, sustained personal injuries while assisting to unload a heavy ensilage cutter from a freight train operated by petitioner. He sued in a state court, and recovered damages on the theory that state law, and not the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59), applied. 192 Ind. 199, 134 N. E. 858. This court reversed the judgment, holding that the federal act applied, and remanded the cause for a new trial. On February 10, 1921, while the appeal was pending in the state Supreme Court, Burtch died, and his widow (now Lula Carroll) was appointed administratrix. Upon her application, she was substituted as respondent in this court. B. & O. S. W. R. Co. v. Burtch, \n263 \nU.S. 540\n, 44 S. Ct. 165.\n Three years after the death of Burtch, when the case was back in the state court of first instance, respondent, by leave of that court, amended the complaint, and, among other things, alleged for the first time the death of Burtch as a result of the injury, and demanded judgment in a single sum for the loss and injury sustained by the deceased during his lifetime and the pecuniary loss resulting from his death. A motion to require respondent to state these claims as separate causes of action was over- \n\n[280 U.S. 491, 494]\n\u00a0\n ruled. The answer affirmatively alleged that, in so far as the amended complaint was based upon the death of Burtch, the cause of action was barred because not brought within two years, as required by section 6 of the act (U. S. Code, tit. 45,  56 (45 USCA  56)), which provides that no action shall be maintained under the act unless commenced within two years from the day the cause of action accrued. The jury returned a verdict for respondent, and the judgment thereon was affirmed by the state Supreme Court. 163 N. E. 99.\n In respect of the statute of limitations, that court held that the challenged amendment did not introduce a new cause of action, but was a mere amplification of the original complaint and related back to the commencement of the action. In support of the ruling, reliacne was had upon the decision of this reliance was had upon the decisions of this first time setting up the right of the plaintiff to sue as personal representative, Mo., Kans. & Tex. Ry. Co. v. Wulf, \n226 \nU.S. 570\n, 33 S. Ct. 135, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 134, nor an amendment for the first time alleging that the parties were engaged in interstate commerce, N. Y. Cent. R. R. Co. v. Kinney, \n260 \nU.S. 340\n, 43 S. Ct. 122, introduces a new cause of action. Each of these decisions proceeds upon the ground that the amendment did not set up any different state of facts as the ground of action, and therefore it related back to the beginning of the action. In the Kinney Case it was pointed out that the original declaration was consistent with a wrong under either state or federal law, as the facts might turn out, and that the acts constituting the tort were the same whichever law gave them that effect.\n But here two distinct causes of action are involved, one for the loss and suffering of the injured person while he lived, and another for the pecuniary loss to the beneficiaries named in the act as a result of his death. St. Louis, Iron M. & S. Ry. Co. v. Craft, \n237 \nU.S. 648, 658\n, 35 S. Ct. 704, 706; C., B. & Q. R. Co. v. Wells-Dickey Trust Co., \n275 \nU.S. 161, 162\n, 48 S. Ct. 73, 59 A. L. R. 758. In the Craft Case it was said: 'Although originating in the same \n\n[280 U.S. 491, 495]\n\u00a0\n wrongful act or neglect, the two claims are quite distinct, no part of either being embraced in the other. ... One begins where the other ends, and a recovery upon both in the same action is not a double recovery for a single wrong, but a single recovery for a double wrong.' And in the Wells- Dickey Case it was explicitly held that for an injury resulting in death the act gives two distinct causes of action.\n The statute, it is true, provides that 'there shall be only one recovery for the same injury'; but this has the effect, not of merging the two rights into a single cause of action, but of limiting the personal representative 'to one recovery of damages for both, and so to avoid the needless litigation in separate actions of what would better be settled once for all in a single action.' St. Louis, Iron M. & S. Ry. Co. v. Craft, supra, page 659 of 237 U. S., 35 S. Ct. 707.\n The cause of action which arises from death accrues at the time of death, and the two-year period of limitation then begins. Reading Co. v. Koons, \n271 \nU.S. 58\n, 46 S. Ct. 405. Here, more than two years having passed, the amendment, introducing as it did a new and distinct cause of action, does not relate back to the beginning of the action so as to avoid the bar of the statute of limitations, Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Wyler, \n158 U.S. 285\n, 296-298, 15 S. Ct. 877, and, since the verdict of the jury was for a single sum, including an undertermined amount as damages for the death, the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial only upon the alleged cause of action for the personal injuries suffered by the deceased.\n The court below gave weight to the fact that this court, in disposing of the former appeal, remanded the cause for a new trial, and suggests that this would not have been done if the complaint was not subject to amendment so as to allow a submission of the case to a jury under the federal act. It is enough to say that on the former appeal the right to maintain an action on account of \n\n[280 U.S. 491, 496]\n\u00a0\n Burtch's death was in no way involved; and there is no warrant for assuming that this court had in mind any future proceedings in respect thereof.\n We do not stop to discuss the complaint, rather faintly urged, that the trial court gave conflicting and improper instructions to the jury on the subject of assumption of risk. That question received the consideration of this court in Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Archibald, \n170 \nU.S. 665, 671\n, 18 S. Ct. 777, and Choctaw, Oklahoma & G. R. Co. v. McDade, \n191 \nU.S. 64, 68\n, 24 S. Ct. 24, and the rule to be followed in any subsequent trial of this case will there be found fully and carefully stated. Under the rule established by these cases, some of the instructions of the court were over favorable to the railroad company rather than the reverse. On the other hand, the charge in respect of the duty of the employer to furnish safe appliances was without qualification, and the jury might well have understood that the duty was an absolute one. That is not the law. The employer is not held to an absolute responsibility for the reasonably safe condition of the place, tools, and appliances, but only to the duty of exercising reasonable care to that end.

J., for petitioner.\n Mr. Morris Hillquit, of New York City, for respondents. \n\n[281 U.S. 462, 463]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n For the purpose of the present decision this case may be stated as it is stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 'The Barker Painting Company, a corporation of New York with its 'home office' in New York City, had a contract for painting at Somerville, New Jersey. The job was about thirty per cent. completed when the defendant union called off its men by force of the offending rules which require a contractor to pay the wage rate of his home district or that of the locality of the work, whichever is higher. The Barker Company filed the bill in equity in this case stating the facts and alleging unlawfulness of the rules because violative of sundry provisions of the federal Constitution and federal laws. The trial judge issued a preliminary injunction, mandatory in character in that it restrained the workmen from observing the union rules and from not returning to work. All the men save one obeyed the injunction, returned to work and completed the job.' This happened before a decision upon the merits by the District Court, April 14, 1926, 12 F. (2d) 945, and a final decree dismissing the bill, March 23, 1928. The Circuit Court of Appeals, while intimating its probable adhesion to its former decision in a similar case, Barker Painting Co. v. Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators and Paperhangers of America, 15 F.(2d) 16, in accord with the decree below, declined to deal with the merits on the ground that it had become unnecessary to deal with them and for that reason affirmed the dismissal of the bill. 34 F.(2d) 3.\n Both sides desired that the Court should go farther afield. But a Court does all that its duty compels when it confines itself to the controversy before it. It cannot be required to go into general propositions or prophetic statements of how it is likely to act upon other possible \n\n[281 U.S. 462, 464]\n\u00a0\n or even probable issues that have not yet arisen. See Willing v. Chicago Auditorium Association, \n277 \nU.S. 274\n, 48 S. Ct. 507. The controversy here was between the plaintiff and the painters in Somerville who prevented its finishing its job. If the case had needed to be considered on its merits, it would have been likely to involve a discussion more or less far reaching of the powers of the Union, but the plaintiff could not impose a duty to go into that discussion when before the time for it the resistance had been withdrawn and the job had been done.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBEAUMONT, S.

Reidy and Daniel W. Knowlton, both of Washington, D. C., for the United States and Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Frank H. Towner, of Chicago Ill., for the western trunk carriers.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought in the District Court for the Western District of Missouri by appellants, carriers in southwestern territory, against the United States, to annul and set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission prescribing divisions of joint rates applicable to certain freight traffic between points in that territory and points in western trunk line territory or via western lines to and from points in eastern territory. The Commission and certain western trunk line carriers intervened. The case was tried before a court of three judges. Title 28 U. s. Code,  47, 28 USCA  47. It sustained the order and dismissed the petition. 36 F.(2d) 789. The southwestern lines appealed. Title 28, U. S. Code,  345(4), 28 USCA  345(4). The court stayed the enforcement of the prescribed divisions until determination here. The United States and Interstate Commerce Commission appealed from that order.\n The Commission's order complained of was made in proceedings, instituted October 8, 1923, by the Commission \n\n[282 U.S. 74, 78]\n\u00a0\n on its own motion. Its report defines western trunk line territory to include Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Illinois, North Dakota, South Dakota, and that part of Missouri on and north of the main line of the Missouri Pacific between Kansas City and St. Louis; it defines the southwestern territory to include Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, that part of Louisiana west of the Mississippi river, and so much of Missouri as is south of the above-mentioned line of the Missouri Pacific.\n Twelve western trunk lines and thirty-two southwestern lines were parties to this investigation. The former, carriers in that territory having little or no mileage in the southwest, demanded increases, and were by the Commission called complainants; the latter, carriers in the southwest having little or no mileage in the other territory, merely sought to retain the existing divisions, and were called defendants. The Santa Fe and Rock Island, named as defendants, have important lines in both territories. The former regarded itself as a southwestern carrier; the latter remained neutral. The investigation was as to the reasonableness of divisions of joint rates on freight traffic between points on lines of respondents in southwestern territory and points on lines of respondents in western trunk line territory moving through Kansas City or St. Louis in Missouri, East St. Louis, Cairo, Gale, or Thebes in Illinois, and of divisions of the joint rates accruing to respondents on traffic moving through such gateways between such points in southwestern territory and points in eastern territory that lie east of the Illinois- Indiana state line.\n The Commission made a report (148 I. C. C. 457) in which, among other things it found (page 477):\n Existing divisions were established for the most part about 35 years ago, and conform to no logical or consistent basis. They are considerably more favorable to the western trunk lines in case of oil and lumber than in case of \n\n[282 U.S. 74, 79]\n\u00a0\n other traffic. Transportation conditions have changed materially since most of the divisions were established, and the changes have benefited the southwestern lines more than they have those in the other group. And the trend is distinctively in favor of the former. In respect of density of traffic, transportation conditions are more favorable in western trunk line territory, but conditions vary in different parts of that territory, and are considerably more favorable in Illinois than in the other states included in that region, and are progressively less favorable from east to west. The difference in transportation conditions is reflected in the level of rates in the two territories. It is not possible from the record to determine just what the average difference is, but it appears to be greater than the difference in average transportation conditions. This is particularly true of the class rates, which are constructed upon somewhat different theories in the two territories and are in process of revision in the western trunk line territory. The cost of operation per ton mile, including all expenses, charges, and a fair return on investment probably does not average as much as 20 per cent. higher in the southwestern territory than in the other group. On the whole, the financial condition of the western trunk lines is not as good as that of the southwestern lines.\n The report continues (page 478):\n'The divisions here in issue are dealt with of record on a group basis. They are, in other words, the divisions 'in the aggregate' north and south of the gateways named, and no question is raised with respect to the divisions of individual carriers. In our opinion the divisions in issue are not just, reasonable, and equitable. Many of them are unjust to complainants, and some of them are unjust to defendants. To cure their defects, they must be readjusted upon a consistent basis which will as nearly as practicable reflect, in the light of all the facts of record, the differing conditions in the two territories.' \n\n[282 U.S. 74, 80]\n\u00a0\n The Commission found that divisions for the future should be made as follows: The joint rates applicable to traffic moving to or from points in Illinois and Wisconsin should be divided in the proportions that the first- class rate on the southwestern scale for the length of haul south of the gateway and 80 per cent. of such rate for the length of haul north of the gateway, respectively, bear to the total of such assumed rates. Similarly, the joint rates on traffic to or from other points in western trunk line territory should be divided by taking for the northern haul 87 (instead of 80) per cent. of such assumed rate. The western trunk lines' share of joint rates applicable on the traffic to or from points in the territory east of the Illinois-Indiana line should be determined in like manner on the basis of 80 per cent. of the assumed rate for the northern haul and by deducting 10 cents from that portion. Where differentials are used in the construction of the joint rates, they should be deducted before prorating and added to the division accruing to the carriers in the region where they apply. These rules or formulas were made subject to some exceptions, which need not be given.\n\n The report states that the assumed rates are intended to reflect general differences in transportation conditions. The factor of 80 per cent. gives the southwestern carriers an advantage of 25 per cent., and the use of 87 per cent. makes a difference in their favor of about 15 per cent. The Commission found that complexity in the bases to be employed is not desirable, that the differentiation provided for would produce sufficiently accurate and reasonable results, and that divisions made in the manner specified will for the future be just, reasonable, and equitable.\n The southwestern lines presented a petition for rehearing which was denied. But the Commission made an additional report, 156 I. C. C. 94, and modified its findings as to joint rates applicable to traffic to and from points \n\n[282 U.S. 74, 81]\n\u00a0\n in Illinois and Wisconsin or in the eastern territory by changing the factor attributable to the haul north of the gateways other than Kansas City from 80 to 75 per cent. of the assumed rate, and by increasing from 10 cents to 15 cents the amount to be deducted from the western lines' proportion of joint rates applicable to and from points in eastern territory.\n On the same day that it announced its second report, June 10, 1929, the Commission made the order. As to the joint rates in question, it directs that the 'just, reasonable and equitable divisions in the aggregate north and south of said gateways' shall be made in accordance with the findings and formulas above mentioned. Divisions made on the bases prescribed, while decreasing the western trunk lines' shares on some shipments, will increase them on many more, and it is estimated that the order will operate to give those lines about $3,000,000 annually, over and above what would be yielded to them under existing divisions. This is much less than 1 per cent. of the total freight operating revenues of the southwestern carriers.\n The appellants contend that the act requires the Commission to determine the divisions of each carrier upon a consideration of its own rights and needs, and does not authorize the Commission to base its order upon group conditions or upon average conditions in the group.\n Section 15(6) provides that whenever, after full hearing, the Commission is of opinion that divisions of joint rates are or will be unjust, unreasonable, inequitable, or unduly preferential or prejudicial as between parties thereto, the Commission shall by order prescribe the just, reasonable, and equitable divisions thereof to be received by the several carriers. 'In so prescribing and determining the divisions of joint rates, fares and charges, the Commission shall give due consideration, among other \n\n[282 U.S. 74, 82]\n\u00a0\n things, to the efficiency with which the carriers concerned are operated, the amount of revenue required to pay their respective operating expenses, taxes, and a fair return on their railway property held for and used in the service of transportation, and the importance to the public of the transportation services of such carriers; and also whether any particular participating carrier is an originating, intermediate, or delivering line, and any other fact or circumstance which would ordinarily, without regard to the mileage haul, entitle one carrier to a greater or less proportion than another carrier of the joint rate, fare or charge.' Title 49, U. S. Code,  15(6), 49 USCA  15(6).\n The facts specified above and others necessarily or properly to be taken into account are to be considered having regard to the duty of the Commission, section 15a(2), 49 USCA  15a(2), to establish and adjust rates so that the carriers as a whole in each rate group or territory that the Commission may designate will, under management and expenditures such as are there specified, earn as nearly as may be a fair return upon the aggregate value of their operating property.\n The Commission by section 15(6) is required to consider the condition of each carrier and to determine whether the division of each joint rate is unreasonable or otherwise repugnant to the specified standards and what division will for the future be just, reasonable, and equitable. United States v. Abilene & So. Ry. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 291\n, 44 S. Ct. 565. The Commission may not change an existing division unless it finds that division unjust or unreasonable. Brimstone R. R. Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 104, 115\n, 48 S. Ct. 282. Cf. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. R., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 92\n, 33 S. Ct. 185. But it need not under all circumstances take specific evidence as to each rate of every carrier. When considering divisions of numerous joint rates applicable to traffic passing through gateways between different territories, the Commission may \n\n[282 U.S. 74, 83]\n\u00a0\n make the required determinations and establish the bases for divisions between groups of carriers in the respective territories upon evidence which it reasonably may deem typical and to have sufficient probative weight to justify the necessary findings and the order in respect of each rate. That is to say, such typical evidence may sufficiently disclose the facts necessary to enable the Commission duly to consider the divisions of each joint rate to be received by every carrier. New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 191\n, 196 S., 199, 43 S. Ct. 270. Brimstone R. R. Co. v. United States, supra, \n276 \nU.S. 116\n, 48 S. Ct. 282.\n The evidence before the Commission is sufficient to disclose as to each carrier all the facts specified in section 15(6) and to furnish an adequate and reasonable basis for the proper division of each of the joint rates applicable to the traffic here involved. The mere fact that carriers and divisions were dealt with on an average or group basis does not indicate that the Commission did not properly consider each carrier and rate, or that it did not duly take into account the facts specified in section 15(6), or that it failed to obey the statute in any respect.\n Appellants assert that the order is based solely upon a comparison of average conditions of widely dissimilar carriers comprising each group, and that its enforcement will bring about divisions so unjust and arbitrary as to be beyond the Commission's power. They show by the record that in each group there are carriers that earn little or no return, others that earn substantial amounts, and some that make relatively high returns. They strongly emphasize that the prescribed divisions will operate in some instances to transfer substantial sums from very weak carriers in southwestern territory to prosperous ones in western territory, and insist that mere comparison of returns demonstrates that divisions on a group basis will be unjust and arbitrary. It seems to us that the table \n\n[282 U.S. 74, 84]\n\u00a0\n included in the first report (page 476), and others received in evidence1 show, as between individual carriers in each \n\n[282 U.S. 74, 85]\n\u00a0\n group, so wide a range of rates of return that, if approximate similarity in that respect is essential to the order, its basis cannot be sustained.\n'Average' as used in the report manifestly is not intended to refer to an arithmetical calculation, the quotient \n\n[282 U.S. 74, 86]\n\u00a0\n of a sum divided by the number of its terms. It is rather to be understood as an estimated general mean of the conditions of the several carriers constituting each group, arrived at by the exercise of judgment upon the facts shown by the evidence. The reports satisfactorily show that the findings as to average group conditions taken as a whole are sustained by substantial and persuasive evidence. But they do not deal with the important question whether, under the evidence and having regard to the wide dissimilarities between rates of return earned by individual carriers in each territory, the use of the average or group basis is justified and whether it will produce unreasonable divisions. The general statements in the reports to the effect that the Commission, in reaching its conclusions, considered all the pertinent evidence, add nothing to the prima facie presumption that generally attends determinations of the Commission. Bluefield Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 679, 688\n, 689 S., 43 S. Ct. 675\n\n\n\n The Commission's failure specifically to report the facts and give the reasons on which it concluded that under the circumstances the use of the average or group basis is justified leaves the parties in doubt as to a matter essential to the case, and imposes unnecessary work upon the courts called upon to consider the validity of the order. Complete statements by the Commission showing the grounds upon which its determinations rest are quite as necessary as are opinions of lower courts setting forth the reasons on which they base their decisions in cases analogous to this. Wichita R. R. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n260 \nU.S. 48, 58\n, 43 S. Ct. 51. And we have recently emphasized the duty of such courts fully to state the grounds upon which they act. Virginian Ry. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 675\n, 47 S. Ct. 222; Lawrence v. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry., \n274 \nU.S. 588, 591\n, 592 S., 47 S. Ct. 720; Arkansas Commission v. Chicago, etc., R. R., \n274 \nU.S. 597, 603\n, 47 S. Ct. 724; Hammond v. Schappi Bus Line, \n275 \nU.S. 164, 171\n, 48 S. Ct. 66; Cleveland, etc., \n\n[282 U.S. 74, 87]\n\u00a0\n Ry. v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 404, 414\n, 48 S. Ct. 189; B . & O. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 781, 787\n, 49 S. Ct. 492. And the Commission is not excused by the fact that the carriers presented evidence on a group basis or by the omission of the southwestern lines in their petition for a rehearing to object to the use of averages. The proceedings before the Commission were for the determination of what divisions are and for the future will be reasonable. Here the issue is whether the Commission's amended determinations and the order based on them are valid. Appellants are not estopped from assailing the averages or groups adopted. A sound basis for the rule or formula prescribing the divisions is essential to compliance with the act.\n With this criticism of the reports, we turn to what is shown by the record. A study of the facts that may be gleaned from the latter leads to the opinion that, notwithstanding the wide differences in rates of return between carriers, the basis adopted will not, at least on that account, result in unjust and unreasonable divisions. The Commission must consider the financial condition of the carriers, but it is not required to make that the only test. And it did not take the average of the rates of return as the sole or principal factor for making the divisions. As to each carrier, operating and other conditions were shown and presumably considered by the Commission in deciding whether average or group conditions might appropriately be used. It is not shown that the order will require any service to be rendered at less than cost. It is impossible to make divisions that will yield the same rate of profit to each carrier or upon every commodity or shipment moved by it. The average cost of service was apparently given much weight. It is not suggested that the operating expenses of each carrier attributable to the traffic in question vary as does its rate of return on its business as a whole. Nor does it appear that the \n\n[282 U.S. 74, 88]\n\u00a0\n carriers having the highest rates of return from their total business or from that in the territory in which they belong, move the traffic in question at comparatively low costs. Returns from total business of a carrier and the cost of handling the traffic covered by the joint rates are not dependent upon the same facts; the relation between them is slight and remote. For aught that appears, the carriers having little or no return on their total business may move the traffic in question at low costs and realize a satisfactory percentage of profit on that part of their business.\n Other things being equal, divisions made on the mileage basis will be the same as those made on the basis of relative costs. The Commission found that existing divisions give southwestern lines over 30 per cent. more than their mileage prorate, and the order leaves them substantially more than would divisions on that basis. This indicates that the Commission considered the relatively high costs at which the southwestern lines, or some of them, moved the traffic in question. The fact that average conditions affecting cost of transportation in the two groups have changed and are still growing more favorable to the southwestern lines tends to justify a reduction of their existing divisions. The greater density found in western trunk line territory makes for lower costs, and that is shown to have been taken into account. Appellants have not sustained their contention.\n Appellants claim that the Commission's order, if enforced, will operate to deprive them of their property without due process of law, in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\n It is well-established by the decisions of this court that, in order to invoke such constitutional protection, the facts relied upon to prevent enforcement of rates prescribed by governmental authority must be specifically alleged, and from them it must clearly appear that the enforcement \n\n[282 U.S. 74, 89]\n\u00a0\n of the measure complained of will necessarily deny to the utility the just compensation safeguarded to it by the Constitution. Aetna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, \n275 \nU.S. 440, 447\n, 448 S., 48 S. Ct. 174, and cases cited. Here the joint rates themselves are not assailed as too low, but the claim is that the prescribed divisions are confiscatory. The same rules as to pleading and proof apply to orders prescribing divisions as to laws fixing rates. There is no allegation in the complaint, or evidence in the record to show, that any division to any of the appellants will not yield operating expenses chargeable to the service covered by it plus a reasonable return on property value fairly attributable to that service. There is no foundation in the record for the contention.\n Appellants contend that the provision of the order that applies to the division of revenue derived from traffic between points in the eastern territory and points in the southwestern territory is unlawful because the eastern carriers were not before the Commission and for lack of evidence to show whether the divisions received by them are just.\n Section 15(6) empowers the Commission to determine and prescribe divisions of joint rates 'as between the carriers parties thereto,' and requires it when so doing to consider the condition and needs of each participating carrier. The eastern carriers are parties to the joint rates covering the whole movement. The reasonableness of such rates is not involved. Every carrier, and there may be many, participating in the haul, is entitled to its just share. The record, and especially testimony given in the District Court, shows that there is and long has been a primary division of such joint rates; one part for the carriers participating in transportation east of the Mississippi river, and the other part for those hauling to or from that point. Cf. Terminal R. R. Ass'n. v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 17, 30\n, 45 S. Ct. 5. The proceedings here under considera- \n\n[282 U.S. 74, 90]\n\u00a0\n tion involve only the subdivision of that part of the revenue accruing to southwestern lines and western trunk lines for service performed west of the 'breaking' point at Mississippi river crossings. The eastern carriers are not at all concerned in this subdivision. In proceedings concerning subdivisions of revenues assigned to the western part of the service, it is competent for the Commission to assume validity of the joint rates, their primary divisions and the subdivisions to cover the haul east of the river. The act does not require all questions concerning all divisions of such joint rates to be determined in one proceeding. United States v. Abilene & So. Ry. Co., supra, \n265 \nU.S. 282\n, 44 S. Ct. 565. New England Divisions Case, supra, \n261 \nU.S. 201\n, 43 S. Ct. 270. There was no defect of parties.\n In their brief appellants suggest other grounds on which they claim the order should be annulled. But we think them plainly insufficient to warrant reversal, and that, in view of what already has been shown in this opinion, they do not merit separate discussion.\n The cross-appeal was taken by the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission; the other appellees, western trunk lines, did not join therein. The investigation was pending for more than five years before the first report was announced. December 10, 1928. No order was then made. The Commission allowed the carriers 60 days within which to agree on readjustments. In the report on rehearing, June 10, 1929, the Commission characterized the issues as important and the questions raised as relatively new and difficult. The order was made on the same day to take effect August 1, 1929. Before that date this suit was commenced, and the Commission postponed the taking effect of the order until December 1, 1929. In the meantime the case was tried and decided. It is clear that the Commission did not find that any emergency existed. \n\n[282 U.S. 74, 91]\n\u00a0\n The decree dismissing the case was entered November 27, petition for appeal was filed that day and allowed November 30. Appellants applied for a stay. The time elapsing between the decree and the postponed effective date of the Commission's order was not sufficient to permit the giving of notice to appellees. The court found that novel and important questions concerning which there was serious doubt were presented by the assignment of errors; that if appellants, pending the appeal, paid the prescribed divisions and the order finally should be annulled, they would be in danger of not being able to recover back the amounts in excess of existing divisions because of the financial condition of some of the western trunk line carriers; that, as the prescribed divisions did not apply to all joint rates between the two territories, confusion and large useless expenditures would result if the order were enforced pending the appeal and the decree should be reversed; that the public interest would not suffer in any manner by reason of the stay; and that the rights of the western trunk lines could be protected by bond. The stay was granted on appellants' giving a bond for $3,000,000 for the protection of the carriers to whom the order required payments of higher divisions.\n Western trunk lines applied to have the stay vacated. After hearing and consideration of the showing and arguments made by the parties, the court reaffirmed its earlier findings and conclusions, and further found that since the court's decision the interested carriers, including appellants, had worked diligently to establish the various percentages to be used in making the new divisions, and that the work could not be completed for several months. After reviewing the situation, the court said that the stay, if continued in force, would operate to save the carriers much labor and expense whether the appeal should be successful or not. \n\n[282 U.S. 74, 92]\n\u00a0\n Undoubtedly the court had authority in its discretion, upon entry of the decree dismissing the bill, to stay the enforcement of the prescribed divisions pending appeal. Virginian Ry. v. United States, supra, \n272 \nU.S. 669\n, 47 S. Ct. 222; Omaha & C. B. St. Ry. Co. v. Int. Com. Comm., \n222 \nU.S. 582\n, 32 S. Ct. 833; Cumberland Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., \n260 \nU.S. 212, 219\n, 43 S. Ct. 75; Cotting v. Kansas City Stock Yards Co. (C. C.) 82 F. 850, 857. The court considered, and it cannot be said without reason, that the questions raised by the assignments of error are novel and doubtful. Unlike the situation presented in Virginian Ry. v. United States, supra, postponement of the taking effect of the order would inflict no loss upon the public- producers, shippers, or consumers. It would not unfavorably affect the business of the carriers, and, if the western trunk lines should ultimately be held entitled to the higher divisions, they could be protected by bond. We think it clear that the court did not abuse its discretion in granting the stay.\n The decrees are affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Commission found that rates of return for individual carriers, namely, the principal Chicago-St. Louis and Chicago-Kansas City lines and the prominent southwestern lines, were as follows in 1922 to 1925, inclusive:\n 1922 1923 1924 1925 Western Trunk Lines: Per Cent.

SOUTH CAROLINA TAX COMMISSION(1930)\n\nArgued: Decided: November 24, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Mr. P. F. Henderson, of Aiken, S. C., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. J. Fraser Lyon and John M. Daniel, both of Columbia, S. C., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On March 4, 1924, Francis Beidler, a resident of Chicago, Ill., died in that state, leaving a will by which he bequeathed a portion of his personal property to his wife and children directly, and gave the residue in trust for their benefit and for charitable uses. The will was probated in Illinois, and Francis Beidler, II, and George Engelking, the appellants, qualified as executors.\n At the time of the death of the testator, he owned 8,000 shares of the capital stock of Santee River Cypress Lumber Company, a corporation organized under the laws of South Carolina and doing business in that state. The remind er, 7,000 shares, were owned by the testator's wife and children. In addition, the Santee River Cypress Lumber Company was indebted to the testator in the sum of $556,864.22, for advances made by him to the company, and in the sum of $64,672 for dividends previously declared on his shares. The indebtedness was an open un- \n\n[282 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n secured account which was entered upon the books of the company kept in South Carolina. The testator also kept a complete set of personal books in Chicago upon which appear entries of the amounts due him by the company except the item of dividends.\n The total amount of the indebtedness for advances and dividends, $621, 536.22, was included by the Attorney General of Illinois in the computation of the value of the decedent's estate for the purpose of fixing the inheritance tax payable to that state.\n The executors filed with the South Carolina Tax Commission, as required by the Inheritance Tax Law of South Carolina (Act Feb. 23, 1922 ( 32 St. at Large, p. 800)), an affidavit setting forth all the above- mentioned assets. The payment of the succession tax to the state of South Carolina with respect to the shares of stock owned by the testator in the Santee River Cypress Lumber Company was not contested by the executors, and by agreement the value of these shares was fixed at $204 per share, or $ 1,632,000. The South Carolina Tax Commission also levied a tax upon the transfer of the indebtedness, overruling the claim of the executors that the state of South Carolina had no jurisdiction to impose such a tax, and that the levy of it would constitute a deprivation of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution. This contention was renewed upon the appeal of the executors to the Supreme Court of the state of South Carolina. That court sustained the action of the Tax Commission with respect to the taxability of the transfer of the indebtedness, and the executors bring this appeal to review that part of the judgment.\n In reaching its conclusion as to the validity of the tax, the state court relied chiefly upon the decision of this Court in Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189\n, 23 S. Ct. 277. That decision has been overruled, and it is now established that the mere fact that the debtor is domiciled within the state \n\n[282 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n does not give it jurisdiction to impose an inheritance or succession tax upon the transfer of the debt by a decedent who is domiciled in another state. Farmers Loan & Trust Company v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204\n, 50 S. Ct. 98, 101, 65 A. L. R. 1000; Baldwin v. Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586\n, 50 S. Ct. 436. The transfer is taxable by the state of the domicile of the deceased owner. Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1\n, 48 S. Ct. 410. Open accounts, including credits for cash deposited in bank, fall within this principle, and its application is not defeated by the mere presence of bonds or notes, or other evidences of debt, within a state other than that of the domicile of the owner. Baldwin v. Missouri, supra.\n It is sought to sustain the tax by South Carolina upon the ground that the indebtedness had what is called a 'business situs' in that state, and the state court adverted to this basis for the tax. In Farmers Loan & Trust Company v. Minnesota, supra, this court reserved the question of business situs, saying: 'New Orleans v. Stemple, \n175 \nU.S. 309\n, 20 S. Ct. 110; Bristol v. Washington County, \n177 \nU.S. 133\n, 20 S. Ct. 585; Liverpool & L. & G. Ins. Co. v. Orleans Assessors, \n221 \nU.S. 346\n, 31 S. Ct. 550, L. R. A. 1915C, 903, recognize the principle that choses in action may acquire a situs for taxation other than at the domicile of their owner, if they have become integral parts of some local business. The present record gives no occasion for us to inquire whether such securities can be taxed a second time at the owner's domicile.' But a conclusion that debts have thus acquired a business situs must have evidnce to support it, and it is our province to inquire whether there is such evidence when the inquiry is essential to the enforcement of a right suitably asserted under the federal Constitution. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[282 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n In the present case, beyond the mere fact of stock ownership and the existence of the indebtedness, there is no evidence whatever, having any bearing upon the question, save a copy of the decedent's account with the corporation, taken from his books which were kept by him in his office at Chicago. The various items of debit and credit in this account, in the absence of any further evidence. add nothing of substance to the fact of the indebtedness as set forth in the agreed statement and afford no adequate basis for a finding that the indebtedness had a business situs in South Carolina.\n That the decedent was largely interested in the affairs of the corporation is apparent; he owned a majority of its stock, but nothing is shown which derogates from its existence as a corporation, transacting its business as such, with corresponding corporate rights and liabilities. The interest of the decedent as a stockholder was a distinct interest,2 and the estate of the decedent has been taxed by South Carolina upon the transfer of his stock according to its agreed value. With respect to the items of indebtedness of the corporation to the decedent, the latter appears upon the record simply as a creditor, with his domicile in Illinois.\n For these reasons, the judgment of the state court, so far as it relates to the taxation of the transfer of the debts in question, must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\n[282 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n The decisions of last term cited by the CHIEF JUSTICE seem to sustain the conclusion reached by him. Therefore Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and I acquiesce, without repeating reasoning that did not prevail with the Court. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Kansas City Southern Railway Co. v.

C., for petitioner Bender.\n\n\n[282 U.S. 127, 129]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Dunbar, Jr., Monte M. Lemann, and J. Blanc Monroe, all of New Orleans, La., for respondent Pfaff. \n\n[282 U.S. 127, 130]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented in this case is the same as tha de alt with in Nos. 15 (Poe v. Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101\n, 51 S. Ct. 58), 84 ( Hopkins v. Bacon, \n282 \nU.S. 122\n, 51 S. Ct. 62), and 106 ( Goodell v. Koch, \n282 \nU.S. 118\n, 51 S. Ct. 62). The only variant is that here we are concerned with the community property law of Louisiana. The case comes here on certiorari (\n281 \nU.S. 715\n, 50 S. Ct. 460) to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed (38 F.(2d) 649) a judgment of the District Court (38 F.(2d) 642) in favor of the respondent, whereby respondent recovered the amount of an additional assessment paid under protest. As in the other cases the Commissioner made this additional assessment on the theory that under the law of Louisiana the whole community income is to be treated as the income of the husband. \n\n[282 U.S. 127, 131]\n\u00a0\n If the test be, as we have held it is, ownership of the community income, this case is probably the strongest of those presented to us, in favor of the wife's ownership of one-half of that income. The relevant statutes of Louisiana are noted in the margin. \n1\n So-called 'common property' includes all property acquired in any manner by husband and wife during marriage except donations made to one of the spouses, and except the wife's earnings and actions for damages when she is living apart from her husband, or carrying on a separate business or trade. The statutes speak of a marriage superinducing as a matter of right, 'partnership or community' of acquets or gains. Repeatedly the statutes refer to the relation as a 'partnership or community.' The decisions of the Supreme Court of Louisiana clearly recognize the wife's ownership of one-half of all the community income. They unequivocally declare that the wife's half interest in such community property 'is not a mere expectancy during the marriage.' Phillips v. Phillips, 160 La. 813, 107 So. 584, 588.\n As in the case of other states, whose law we have discussed in connection with this matter in No. 15, No. 106, and No. 84, each spouse may by will dispose of only his or her one-half of the community and is powerless to affect the other's half. In case of death intestate one-half descends to the heirs of the decedent, and the other spouse is powerless to prevent this. \n\n[282 U.S. 127, 132]\n\u00a0\n While the husband is the manager of the affairs of the marital partnership, the limitations upon the wrongful exercise of his power over community property are more stringent than in many states which have a community system. In Louisiana, if the husband proves, by reason of financial difficulties or the like, an unfit manager, the wife may bring about an immediate dissolution and liquidation of the community property. Wolf v. Lowry, 10 La. Ann. 272; Webb v. Bell, 24 La. Ann. 75; Brown v. Smythe, 40 La. Ann. 325, 4 So. 300. And when the wife sues for a separation of the property she is entitled to an accounting from the husband for community income or property in his hands and to reimbursement and retribution for any act done by him in fraud of her rights. Hill v. Hill, 115 La. 490, 39 So. 503; White v. White, 150 La. 1065, 106 So. 567.\n In conclusion it may be noted that the Supreme Court of Louisiana has cited our own decisions in Warburton v. White, \n176 \nU.S. 484\n, 20 S. Ct. 404, and Arnett v. Reade, \n220 \nU.S. 311\n, 31 S. Ct. 425, 36 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1010, indicating that the exposition of the wife's rights and of the nature of te c ommunity therein contained correctly states the Louisiana doctrine.\n Inasmuch, therefore, as, in Louisiana, the wife has a present vested interest in community property equal to that of her husband, we hold that the spouses are entitled to file separate returns, each treating one-half of the community income as income of each 'of' them as an 'individual' as those words are used in  210(a) and 211(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 ( 44 Stat. 21, 26 USCA  951 note, 952 note).\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] La.

Com'rs of State of North Dakota v. Great No. Ry. Co. \n281 U.S. 412\n (1930) ]\n\n\n[281 U.S. 412, 414]\n\u00a0\n Mr. R. J. Hagman, of St. Paul, Minn., for appellees.\n\n\n[281 U.S. 412, 416]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On May 8, 1929, the Board of Railroad Commissioners of the State of North Dakota made an order prescribing intrastate class rates. The existing rates were reduced about 10 per cent, and the order was made effective on July 1, 1929. The appellees, common carriers engaged in interstate transportation and also in intrastate transportation in North Dakota, brought this suit on June 25, 1929, in the District Court to enjoin enforcement of the order pending the determination by the Interstate Commerce Commission of the question whether the intrastate rates, as thus prescribed, cause an undue or unreasonable discrimination against interstate commerce in violation of section 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  13). The District Court, composed of three judges, as required by statute, granted an interlocutory injunction to this effect ( 33 F.(2d) 934), and the Railroad Commission of the State and the other state officials, who were defendants, have brought this appeal.\n On August 26, 1920, the Interstate Commerce Commission, in a proceeding known as Ex parte 74, authorized a general advance in interstate freight rates throughout the United States. Increased Rates, 1920, 58 I. C. C. 220. The appellees then applied to the Board of Railroad Commissioners of North Dakota for authority to make \n\n[281 U.S. 412, 417]\n\u00a0\n increases in the North Dakota intrastate class rates to correspond with the increases which had been made in the interstate class rates. The State Commission denied the application. Thereupon, in a proceeding (Docket No. 12,085) under section 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act the Interstate Commerce Commission made a finding that the interstate rates established by the carriers, as a result of the decision in Ex parte 74, were reasonable for interstate transportation and that the failure correspondingly to increase the intrastate rates within the state of North Dakota resulted in an undue preference to the shippers of intrastate traffic within that state and in an unjust discrimination against interstate commerce. On May 3, 1921, the Interstate Commerce Commission entered an order requiring these carriers to increase the intrastate freight rates in North Dakota so as to correspond with the advances in interstate rates. North Dakota Rates, Fares, and Charges, 61 I. C. C. 504. These increases were made, effective May 27, 1921\n\n\n On June 5, 1922, the Board of Railroad Commissioners of North Dakota made an order reciting that the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission of May 3, 1921, practically deprived the State Commission of its power to regulate intrastate rates and that appropriate action should be taken to terminate the disability. Upon application by the State Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission (July 22, 1922) vacated its order of May 3, 1921, in so far as it related to intrastate rates in North Dakota, stating that 'the existing increased intrastate rates and charges for freight services in said State will continue in force and effect until revoked, modified or superseded by appropriate lawful proceedings before said Board' (the State Commission) 'or as otherwise provided by law.' The State Commission was thus left free to exercise its lawful authority over intrastate rates. \n\n[281 U.S. 412, 418]\n\u00a0\n The Congress, by Joint Resolution of January 30, 1925 (43 Stat. 801 ( 49 USCA  55)), directed the Interstate Commerce Commission to make an investigation of the rate structure of common carriers in order to determine to what extent and in what manner existing rates and charges might be unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory, and to make such changes, adjustments and redistribution of rates and charges as might be found to be necessary. The Commission was required to make from time to time such decisions as it might deem appropriate to establish a just and reasonable relation between rates upon designated classes of traffic. \n1\n Pursuant to this direction, the Inter- \n\n[281 U.S. 412, 419]\n\u00a0\n state Commerce Commission on March 12, 1925, instituted the proceeding known as Docket No. 17000, 'Rate Structure Investigation,' and all common carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act were made respondents. Notice was sent to the Governor of each state and to the state regulatory commissions. The Interstate Commerce Commission thus undertook the investigation of the rate structure in the entire western district, including class rates in the region embracing the state of North Dakota. The Board of Railroad Commissioners of that state, with other state railroad commissions, have been cooperating in this investigation and the proceeding is still pending.\n On May 29, 1925, the Board of Railroad Commissioners of North Dakota on its own motion began an investigation for the purpose of determining to what extent, if any, the North Dakota intrastate rates were unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory. In September, 1927, the State Commission directed that the record should be held open for further hearing after the Interstate Commerce Commission rendered a decision in its Docket No. 17000. A few months later, the State Commission resumed its general investigation, and a hearing was held in relation to class rates and certain other rates. This resulted in the order of May 8, 1929, now in question, reducing the existing intrastate class rates.\n The appellees then filed a petition with the Interstate Commerce Commission alleging that the scale of class rates required by the State Commission would unjustly discriminate against persons and localities in interstate commerce, and would constitute an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce, in violation of section 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act, and asked the Interstate Commerce Commission to institute a proceeding to determine whether such unjust discrimination would result and to \n\n[281 U.S. 412, 420]\n\u00a0\n prohibit it by prescribing the class rates to be charged by the carriers for intrastate transportation in North Dakota. Thereupon, this suit was brought. The interlocutory injunction, granted below, restrained the State Commission and other state officials from putting into effect the intrastate class rates prescribed by the order of May 8, 1929, until the Interstate Commerce Commission, either in its Docket No. 17000, or in the proceeding under section 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act which the plaintiffs (appellees) had petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission to institute, determined the question of unjust discrimination with respect to interstate commerce, and until the further order of the court.\n It should be observed at the outset that there is no contention on the part of the carriers that the intrastate rates fixed by the State Commission are confiscatory. There is no challenge of the authority of the State Commission under the Constitution and laws of the state to prescribe these rates for intrastate traffic, or of the validity or regularity of the proceedings which resulted in the order of the State Commission, aside from the alleged effect upon interstate commerce.\n The question of the control of the state, as against an objection of this sort, over rates for transportation exclusively intrastate was considered in the Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352\n, 33 S. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18. The state of Minnesota had established rates for intrastate transportation throughout the state, and the complaining carriers insisted that by reason of the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act the state could no longer exercise the untrammeled statewide authority that it had formerly enjoyed in prescribing reasonable intrastate rates, and that the scheme of rates which Minnesota had prescribed, even if found to be otherwise not subject to attack, was void because of their injurious effect upon interstate commerce. There had been no finding by the Interstate Commerce Commission \n\n[281 U.S. 412, 421]\n\u00a0\n of unjust discrimination against interstate commerce by reason of the intrastate rates and, reserving the question of the validity and consequence of such a finding if one were made by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the court decided that there was no ground for invalidating the action of the state. Dealing with the interblending of operations in the conduct of interstate and local business by interstate carriers, the court said that these considerations were for the practical judgment of Congress, and that if adequate regulation of interstate rates could not be maintained without imposing requirements as to such intrastate rates as substantially affected the former, it was for Congress, within the limits of its constitutional authority over interstate commerce, to determine the measure of the regulation it should apply. It was not the function of the court to provide a more comprehensive scheme of regulation than Congress had decided upon, nor, in the absence of Federal action, to deny effect to the laws of the state enacted within the field which it was entitled to occupy until its authority was limited through the exertion by Congress of its paramount constitutional power. On the assumption that section 3 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  3) should be construed as applicable to unreasonable discriminations between localities in different states, as well when arising from an intrastate rate as compared with an interstate rate as when due to interstate rates exclusively, the court was of the opinion that the controlling principle governing the enforcement of the act should be applied to such cases and that the question of the existence of such a discrimination would be primarily for the investigation and determination of the Interstate Commerce Commission and not for the courts. Id., page 419 of 230 U. S., 33 S. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18.\n The controlling principle, thus invoked, was derived from a consideration of the nature of the question and of the inquiry and action required for its solution. The \n\n[281 U.S. 412, 422]\n\u00a0\n inquiry would necessarily relate to technical and intricate matters of fact, and the solution of the question would demand the exercise of sound administrative discretion. The accomplishment of the purpose of Congress could not be had without the comprehensive study of an expert body continuously employed in administrative supervision. Only through the action of such a body could there be secured the uniformity of ruling upon which appropriate protection from unreasonable exactions and unjust discriminations must depend. Id., pages 419, 420, of 230 U. S., 33 S. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18. See Great Northern Railway Co. v. Merchants' Elevator Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285, 291\n, 42 S. Ct. 477.\n The application of this principle had frequent illustration before the question arose as to unjust discriminations against interstate commerce through the fixing of intrastate rates. In Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n, 27 S. Ct. 350, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075, the court decided that a shipper could not maintain an action because of the exaction of an alleged unreasonable rate on interstate shipments, when the rate had been duly filed and published by the carrier and had not been found to be unreasonable by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The court found an indissoluble unity between the provision for the maintenance of rates as established in accordance with the statute and the prohibitions against preferences and discriminations, and declared that to maintain the just relation which the statute was intended to conserve it was essential that there should be uniformity of decision and that redress should be sought primarily through the administrative powers entrusted to the Interstate Commerce Commission. In Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. v. United States ex rel. Pitcairn Coal Co., \n215 \nU.S. 481\n, 30 S. Ct. 164, complaint was made by the coal company of the method of distribution of coal cars, which was said to amount to an unjust discrimination. The court considered the controversy to be con- \n\n[281 U.S. 412, 423]\n\u00a0\n trolled by the decision in the Abilene Case, supra, and that the grievances of which complaint was made were primarily within the administrative competency of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The court said that the amendments of 1906 of the Interstate Commerce Act rendered, if possible, more imperative the construction which had been given to the act in this respect. After adverting to the case of Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central Railroad Co., \n215 \nU.S. 452\n, 30 S. Ct. 155, the court again pointed out 'the destructive effect upon the system of regulation adopted by the Act to Regulate Commerce,' if it were construed as 'giving authority to the courts, without the preliminary action of the Commission, to consider and pass upon the administrative questions which the statute has primarily confided to that body.' Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. U. S. ex rel. Pitcairn Coal Co., 215 U. S. page 496, 30 S. Ct. 164, 170. The question was again considered in Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., \n222 \nU.S. 506\n, 32 S. Ct. 114, where the court held that no action for reparation for discriminatory exactions for freight payments could be maintained in any court, federal or state, in the absence of an appropriate finding and order of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Referring to the Abilene Case, supra, the court said: 'It is true that ... in that case the complaint against the established rate was that it was unreasonable, while here the complaint is that the rate was unjustly discriminatory. But the distinction is not material.' Id., page 511 of 222 U. S., 32 S. Ct. 114, 116.2 \n\n[281 U.S. 412, 424]\n\u00a0\n The grounds for invoking this principle of preliminary resort to the Interstate Commerce Commission are even stronger when the effort is made to invalidate intrastate rates upon the ground of unjust discrimination against interstate commerce. Not only are the questions as to the effect of intrastate rates upon interstate rates quite as intricate as those relating to discrimination in interstate rates, not only is there at least an equal need for the comprehensive, expert, and continuous study of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and for the uniformity obtainable only through its action, but in addition there is involved a prospective interference with state action within its normal field, in relation to the domestic concern of transportation exclusively intrastate. The court found no warrant for the contention that Congress in enacting the Interstate Commerce Act intended that there should be such an interference before the fact of unjust discrimination had been established by competent inquiry on the part of the administrative authority to which Congress had intrusted the solution of that class of questions.\n What was lacking in the Minnesota Rate Cases, supra, had been supplied in the Shreveport Case, \n234 \nU.S. 342\n, 34 S. Ct. 833.3 There, the Interstate Commerce Commission had found that there was an unjust discrimination arising out of the relation of intrastate rates, maintained under state authority, to interstate rates which had been upheld as reasonable. The court decided that Congress in exercising its constitutional authority could correct the evil of this discrimination against interstate commerce and that in so doing Congress was entitled to secure the maintenance of its own standard of interstate rates. Having this power, Congress could provide for its exercise through the aid of a subordinate body. The removal of the discrimination \n\n[281 U.S. 412, 425]\n\u00a0\n was within the authority granted to the Interstate Commerce Commission and the decision rested upon the ground that this authority had been exercised. Id., pages 357, 358 of 234 U. S., 34 S. Ct. 833. See also American Express Co. v. South Dakota ex rel. Caldwell, \n244 \nU.S. 617, 625\n, 37 S. Ct. 656; Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. State Public Utilities Commission, \n245 \nU.S. 493, 506\n, 38 S. Ct. 170; Arkansas Railroad Commission v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. R. Co., \n274 \nU.S. 597, 599\n, 47 S. Ct. 724.\n In the Transportation Act 1920 (41 Stat. 484), Congress enacted express provisions with respect to intrastate rates, regulations and practices. Id.  416 (49 USCA  13). Amending section 13 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, Congress authorized the Interstate Commerce Commission to confer with state regulatory bodies with respect to 'the relationship between rate structures and practices of carriers subject to the jurisdiction of such State bodies and of the Commission,' and to hold joint hearings. It was provided that whenever in any such investigation, after full hearing, the Commission finds that any rate, regulation, or practice 'causes any undue or unreasonable advantage, preference, or prejudice as between persons or localities in intrastate commerce on the one hand and interstate or foreign commerce on the other hand, or any undue, unreasonable, or unjust discrimination against interstate or foreign commerce, which is hereby forbidden and declared to be unlawful,' the Commission shall prescribe the rate, regulation, or practice 'thereafter to be observed, in such manner as, in its judgment, will remove' the discrimination. The order of the Commission is to bind the carriers, parties to the proceeding, 'the law of any State or the decision or order of any State authority to the contrary notwithstanding.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[281 U.S. 412, 426]\n\u00a0\n There can be no doubt that Congress thus intended to recognize and incorporate in legislative enactment the principle of the Shreveport Case, supra. \n5\n We find no \n\n[281 U.S. 412, 427]\n\u00a0\n basis for the conclusion that it was the purpose of Congress to interdict a state rate, otherwise lawfully established for transportation exclusively intrastate, before appropriate action by the Interstate Commerce Commission. On the contrary, Congress sought to provide a more satisfactory administrative procedure which would \n\n[281 U.S. 412, 428]\n\u00a0\n elicit the co-operation of the state regulatory bodies, and insure a full examination of all the questions of fact which such bodies might raise, before any finding was made in such a case as to unjust discrimination against interstate commerce or any order was entered superseding the rate authorized by the state. In sustaining the authority of the Commission under section 13 as thus amended, the court said in Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 590\n, 591 S., 42 S. Ct. 232, 238, 22 A. L. R. 1086: 'It is said that our conclusion gives the Commission unified control of interstate and intrastate commerce. It is only unified to the extent of maintaining efficient regulation of interstate commerce under the paramount power of Congress. It does not involve general regulation of intrastate commerce. Action of the Interstate Commerce Commission in this regard should be directed to substantial disparity which operates as a real discrimination against, and obstruction to, interstate commerce, and must leave appropriate discretion to the \n\n[281 U.S. 412, 429]\n\u00a0\n state authorities to deal with intrastate rates as between themselves on the general level which the Interstate Commerce Commission has found to be fair to interstate commerce.' See Arkansas Railroad Commission v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. R. Co., supra.\n When, before the amendments of 1910 of the Interstate Commerce Act, the question arose as to the propriety of judicial action in granting injunctions against the maintenance of interstate rates, filed and published by carriers as provided by law, pending the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission whether such rates were unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory, there was a conflict of opinion in the lower federal courts, but the weight of decision was that such relief, although temporary in character, could not be granted prior to an appropriate finding by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and this ruling accorded with the principle declared by this court in the Abilene and other cases, supra. \n6\n Congress, in 1910, authorized the Interstate Commerce Commission, on the filing of rates by interstate carriers with the Commission, to suspend the operation of the rates for a stated period, and this provision has been continued in later legislation. Interstate Commerce Act  15(7); 36 Stat. 552; 41 Stat. 486, 487 (49 USCA  15(7). This power of suspension was intrusted to the Commission only. There \n\n[281 U.S. 412, 430]\n\u00a0\n is no similar provision for the suspension of intrastate rates established by state authority.\n It is said that the interlocutory injunction, granted below, was in aid of the proceedings pending before the Interstate Commerce Commission. But the injunction necessarily has the effect of preventing the state from enforcing the rates it has prescribed, which are lawful rates until the Interstate Commerce Commission finds that they cause an unjust discrimination against interstate commerce. A judicial restraint of the enforcement of intrastate rates, although limited to the pendency of proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission, is none the less essentially a restraint upon the power of the state to establish rates for its internal commerce, a power the exercise of which in prescribing rates otherwise valid is not subject to interference upon the sole ground of injury to interstate commerce, save as Congress has validly provided. Congress has so provided only in the event that, after full hearing in which the state authorities may participate, the Interstate Commerce Commission finds that unjust discrimination is created. Congress forbids the unjust discrimination through the fixing of intrastate rates, but intrusts the appropriate enforcement of its prohibition primarily to its administrative agency.\n It is urged that the restraining power of the court is needed to prevent irreparable injury. But, in this class of cases, the question whether there is injury, and what the measures shall be to prevent it, is committed for its solution preliminarily to the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n For these reasons, the order of the District Court is reversed, and the cause remanded with direction to dismiss the bill of complaint.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The provision relating to the investigation is as follows:\n'That the Interstate Commerce Commission is authorized and directed to make a thorough investigation of the rate structure of common carriers subject to the interstate commerce act, in order to determine to what extent and in what manner existing rates and charges may be unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, or unduly preferential, thereby imposing undue burdens, or giving undue advantage as between the various localities and parts of the country, the various classes of traffic, and the various classes and kinds of commodities, and to make, in accordance with law, such changes, adjustments, and redistribution of rates and charges as may be found necessary to correct any defects so found to exist. In making any such change, adjustment, or redistribution the commission shall give due regard, among other factors, to the general and comparative levels in market value of the various classes and kinds of commodities as indicated over a reasonable period of years to a natural and proper development of the country as a whole, and to the maintenance of an adequate system of transportation. In the progress of such investigation the commission shall, from time to time, and as expeditiously as possible, make such decisions and orders as it may find to be necessary or appropriate upon the record then made in order to place the rates upon designated classes of traffic upon a just and reasonable basis with relation to other rates. Such investigation shall be conducted with due regard to other investigations or proceedings affecting rate adjustments which may be pending before the commission.' 43 Stat. 801 (49 USCA  55). \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See, also, United States v.

'(3) Whenever in any investigation under the provisions of this Act, or in any investigation instituted upon petition of the carrier concerned, which petition is hereby authorized to be filed, there shall be brought in issue any rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation, or practice, made or imposed by authority of any State, or initiated by the President during the period of Federal control, the Commission, before proceeding to hear and dispose of such issue, shall cause the State or States interested to be notified of the proceeding. The Commission may confer with the authorities of any State having regulatory jurisdiction over the class of persons and corporations subject to this Act with respect to the relationship between rate structures and practices of carriers subject to the jurisdiction of such State bodies and of the Commission; and to that end is authorized and empowered, under rules to be prescribed by it, and which may be modified from time to time, to hold joint hearings with any such State regulating bodies on any matters wherein the Commission is empowered to act and where the rate-making authority of a State is or may be affected by the action taken by the Commission. The Commission is also authorized to avail itself of the cooperation, services, records, and facilities of such State authorities in the enforcement of any provision of this Act. (Continued on p. 425) \n\n'(4) Whenever in any such investigation the Commission, after full hearing, finds that any such rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation, or practice causes any undue or unreasonable advantage, preference, or prejudice as between persons or localities in intrastate commerce on the one hand and interstate or foreign commerce on the other hand, or any undue, unreasonable, or unjust discrimination against interstate or foreign commerce, which is hereby forbidden and declared to be unlawful, it shall prescribe the rate, fare, or charge, or the maximum or minimum, or maximum and minimum, thereafter to be charged, and the classification, regulation, or practice thereafter to be observed, in such manner as, in its judgment, will remove such advantage, preference, prejudice, or discrimination. Such rates, fares, charges, classificaitons, regulations, and practices shall be observed while in effect by the carriers parties to such proceeding affected thereby, the law of any State or the decision or order of any State authority to the contrary notwithstanding.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In presenting these amendments to the Committee of the Whole House, Mr. Esch, Chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives, said:\n'We also provide for the enactment into law of what is popularly known as the decision of the Supreme Court in the Shreveport case. Where intrastate rates constitute an undue burden, advantage, preference or prejudice against interstate rates, such rates are declared to be unlawful. We have incorporated into law the decision of the court. When by reason of the low level of the intrastate rates an undue burden is cast upon the interstate traffic the citizens and the shippers of other States are compelled to pay higher interstate freight rates than they would have had to pay had that State enacted or put into force and effect proper intrastate rates. We give this power of determination to the Interstate Commerce Commission, but in order that the State commissions may have a proper hearing we provide that the State commissions may, to use a phrase of the street, 'sit in' with the Interstate Commerce Commission. It can sit with the Interstate Commerce Commission; it can hear the testimony, and can present its full case, through its legally constituted authority. It can present the full case, but the final adjudication is to rest with the Interstate Commerce Commission and not with the State regulatory body. We believe that this getting together of the interstate and State regulatory bodies will lessen the number of Shreveport cases, better the feeling between the interstate and the State commissions, and promote the commercial interests of the country.' Cong. Rec., 66th Cong., 1st Sess., vol. 58, pt. 8, p. 8317.\n\n Senator Cummins, Chairman of the Committee on Interstate Commerce of the Senate, made the following statement to the Committee of the Whole of the Senate: \n'I need not follow that case' (the Shreveport Case) 'in all its phases; but it finally reached the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Supreme Court held that the authority of the Federal Government as it could be vested in the Interstate Commerce Commission extended to the removal of a discrimination between the interstate rates and the intrastate rates, but no authority had been given by Congress to the commission to declare what the intrastate rate should be in comparison with the interstate rate. ...\n\n'The committee has attempted simply to express the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. We have not attempted to carry the authority of Congress beyond the exact point ruled by the Supreme Court in the cases to which I have referred; and the only thing we have done in the matter has been to confer upon the Interstate Commerce Commission the authority to remove the discrimination when established in a proper proceeding before that body-an authority which it does not not have. ...\n\n'The Supreme Court held that Congress had not conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission the right to prescribe a rate in the stead of one which had been condemned; but so far as the condemnation of the rates is concerned, the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission is already ample, and it has succeeded in one way or another in removing the discriminations which have come under its notice without the statute which we now propose.'

GAGE(1930)\nNo. 61\nArgued: December 6, 1929Decided: January 6, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 327, 328]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Davis, of New York City, J. Sawyer Fitch, of Rochester, N. Y., and Gurdon W. Fitch, of Albion, N. Y., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 327, 332]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles E. Hughes, Jr., Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner's father died testate May 20, 1918. The Surrogate's Court at Rochester, N. Y., entered a final decree April 19, 1920, pursuant to which certain stocks \n\n[280 U.S. 327, 333]\n\u00a0\n were distributed to the petitioner as one of the residuary legatees. He sold some of them in 1920, 1921, and 1922. For his income tax returns, he computed profit or loss on each sale by comparing the selling price of the stock with its value at the date of the decree of distribution, and paid the amounts so determined. But the Commissioner of Internal Revenue held that the values of the stock at the date of testator's death should be taken for the calculation of income, and on that basis assessed for each year an additional tax, which petitioner paid under protest. He brought this action in the District Court for the Western District of New York to recover the amounts so exacted. That court gave judgment for him. 25 F.(2d) 915. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 30 F.(2d) 604.\n The taxes for 1920 are governed by the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1057, 1060, 1065, and those for 1921 and 1922 by the Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 229, 237. As defined in these laws, gross income includes gains derived from sales of property, but does not include the value of property acquired by bequest, devise, or descent. Section 213. Section 202(a) in each act provides that, for the purpose of ascertaining the gain derived or loss sustained from the sale of property 'acquired' on or after March 1, 1913, the basis shall be its cost. Thos provision is made more definite in the act of 1921 by subdivision (3). It provides that, in case of 'property, acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance, the basis shall be the fair market price or value of such property at the time of such acquisition.' It is not suggested by either party that this provision changed the law or that the basis for computing the tax for 1920 under the carlier act is not the same as that applicable for 1921 and 1922 under the later act. It is necessary to construe the word 'acquired' and the phrase 'at the time of such acquisition' to determine whether the value of the stock at the time of testator's \n\n[280 U.S. 327, 334]\n\u00a0\n death or its value on the date of the decree should be used in the calculation.\n Upon the death of the owner, title to his real estate passes to his heirs or devisees. A different rule applies to personal property. Title to it does not vest at once in heirs or legatees. United States v. Jones, \n236 \nU.S. 106, 112\n, 35 S. Ct. 261, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 316. But immediately upon the death of the owner there vests in each of them the right to his distributive share of so much as shall remain after proper administration and the right to have it delivered upon entry of the decree of distribution. Sanders v. Soutter, 136 N. Y. 97, 32 N. E. 638; Vail v. Vail, 49 Conn. 52; Cook v. McDowell, 52 N. J. Eq. 351, 30 A. 24. Upon acceptance of the trust there vests in the administrators or executors, as of the date of the death, title to all personal property belonging to the estate; it is taken, not for themselves, but in the right of others for the proper administration of the estate and for distribution of the residue. The decree of distribution confers no new right; it merely indentifies the property remaining, evidences right of possession in the heirs or legatees, and requires the administrators or executors to deliver it to them. The legal title so given relates back to the date of the death. Foster v. Fifield, 20 Pick. (Mass.) 67, 70; Wager v. Wager, 89 N. Y. 161, 166; Thompson v. Thomas, 30 Miss. 152, 158.\n Petitioner's right later to have his share of the residue vested immediately upon testator's death. At that time petitioner became enriched by its worth, which was directly related to and would increase or decline correspondingly with the value of the property. And, notwithstanding the postponement of transfer of the legal title to him, Congress unquestionably had power and reasonably might fix value at the time title passed from the decedent as the basis for determining gain or loss upon sale of the right or of the property before or after the decree of distribution. And we think that, in substance, it would not be incon- \n\n[280 U.S. 327, 335]\n\u00a0\n sistent with the rules of law governing the descent and distribution of real and personal property of decedents to construe the words in question to mean the date of death.\n Undoubtedly the basis for the ascertainment of gain or loss on the sale of real estate by an heir or devisee is its value at the time of decedent's death. That is 'the time of such acquisition.' The decree of distribution necessarily is later than, and has no definite relation to, the time when the real estate passes. And generally specific bequests are handed over to the legatees soon after the death of the testator, and such property may be and often is sold by them prior to the entry of the decree for final distribution. In such cases gains or losses are to be calculated under these acts on value at the time of death. No other basis is or reasonably could be suggested.\n There is nothing in either of the acts or in their legislative history to indicate a purpose to establish two bases-(1) value of real estate and specific bequests at time of death; and (2) value of other property at date of decree. The rule that ambiguities in tax laws are to be resolved in favor of taxpayers has no application here, because it is impossible to determine which basis would impose a greater burden. And neither construction is to be preferred on the ground that the other would raise serious question as to constitutional validity. The generality of the words used in both acts indicates intention that the value at the time of death of the decedent was to be taken as the basis in all cases.\n The Revenue Act of 1918 and subsequent acts taxed incomes of estates during the period of the administration, including profits on sales of property, and such gains are calculated on value at date of decedent's death. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[280 U.S. 327, 336]\n\u00a0\n There appears to be no reason why gains or losses to the estate should be calculated on one basis and those to the residuary legatees on another.\n Treasury Regulations under the Revenue Acts in force between 1917 and 1928 declared that value at time of the death of decedent should be taken as the basis for ascertaining profit or loss from sale of property acquired by bequest or descent since February 28, 1913. Regulations 33, Revised par. 44, promulgated with reference to section 2(a), Revenue Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 756), provided that, in computing profit or gain upon property acquired by inheritance, the basis should be appraised value at the time of decedent's death. Regulations 45, art. 1562, promulgated with reference to section 202 of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1060) declared that, 'for the purpose of determining the profit or loss from the sale of property acquired by bequest, devise or descent since February 28, 1913, its value as appraised for the purpose of the federal estate tax ... should be deemed to be its fair market value when acquired.' And value at the time of death is the basis of that appraisal. Section 402, 40 Stat. 1097. Regulations 62, art. 1563, under the Act of 1921, are substantially to the same effect as the earlier regulations.\n These regulations were prepared by the Department charged with the duty of enforcing the acts. The rule so established is reasonable and does no violence to the letter or spirit of the provisions construed. A reversal of that construction would be likely to produce inconvenience and result in inequality. It is the settled rule that the practical interpretation of an ambiguous or doubtful statute that has been acted upon by officials charged with its administration will not be disturbed except for weighty reasons. Logan v. Davis, \n233 \nU.S. 613, 627\n, 34 S. Ct. 685; Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 342, 349\n, 40 S. Ct. 155; Swendig v. Washington Co., \n265 \nU.S. 322, 331\n, 44 S. Ct. 496\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 327, 337]\n\u00a0\n The meaning of 'acquired' in section 202(a) of the Act of 1918 was not changed by and in context means the same as does the phrase 'time of such acquisition' in the corresponding provision of the Act of 1921. And that phrase was continued in section 204(a)(5) of the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926. 43 Stat. 258; 44 Stat. 14 (26 USCA  935). The regulations promulgated under that section are substantially the same as the earlier regulations. Regulations 65, art. 1594; Regulations 69, art. 1594. The substantial re-enactment in later acts of the provision theretofore construed by the Department is persuasive evidence of legislative approval of the regulation. National Lead Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 140, 146\n, 40 S. Ct. 237; United States v. Cerecedo Compania, \n209 \nU.S. 337, 339\n, 28 S. Ct. 532; United States v. G. Falk & Brother, \n204 \nU.S. 143, 152\n, 27 S. Ct. 191. The subsequent legislation confirmed and carried forward the policy evidenced by the earlier enactments as interpreted in the regulations promulgated under them.\n The Revenue Act of 1928,  113(a)(5), expressly established value at the time of the death of the decedent as the basis of calculation in respect of sales of personal property acquired by specific bequest and of real estate acquired by general or specific devise or by intestacy, and in all other cases fixed fair market value at the time of distribution to the taxpayer as the basis. 45 Stat. 819 (26 USCA  2113). The deliberate selection of language so differing from that used in the earlier acts indicates that a change of law was intended. Ordinarily, statutes establish rules for the future, and they will not be applied retrospectively unless that purpose plainly appears. United States v. Magnolia Co., \n276 \nU.S. 160, 162\n, 48 S. Ct. 236, and cases cited. There is no support for the suggestion that subdivision (5) expressed the meaning, or was intended to govern or affect the construction, of the earlier statutes.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 219, Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1071; Regulations 45, art. 343.

HILL(1930)\nNo. 464\nArgued: May 1, 1930Decided: June 2, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 673, 674]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Roy W. Rucker, of Sedalia, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. Lieutellus Cunningham, of Jefferson City, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1928, the Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust & Savings Company, acting as trustee for its shareholders, brought this suit in a Missouri court against the treasurer of Henry county, Mo., to enjoin him from collecting or attempting to collect a certain part of the taxes assessed against them for the year 1927 on the shares of its stock; and, pending decision in this suit, to restrain the prosecution of an action already brought by him against the plaintiff for that purpose.\n The bill alleged that the township assessor had intentionally and systematically discriminated against the shareholders by assessing bank stock at full value, while intentionally and systematically omitting to assess certain classes of property and assessing all other classes of property at 75 per cent. or less of their value. It asserted that, to the extent of 25 per cent., the assessments were void because such discrimination violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. And it recited that the plaintiff had tendered, and was continuing to tender, payment of the 75 per cent. of the taxes assessed, which amount it conceded was due. As grounds for equity jurisdiction, the bill charged that relief could not be had at law, either by way of defense in the pending action brought by the treasurer or by paying the tax in full under protest and suing for a refund of 25 per cent. thereof; and that no administrative remedy for the relief \n\n[281 U.S. 673, 675]\n\u00a0\n sought was, or ever had been, provided by law either by appeal or otherwise to or from the county board of equalization or the state board of equalization.\n The defendant's answer denied all the allegations of discrimination and further opposed relief in equity on the grounds that the plaintiff had not pursued remedies before the county or state board of equalization pursuant to articles 3 and 5 of chapter 119 of the Missouri Revised Statutes of 1919 (sections 12820-12827, 12853-12857), and that the plaintiff was guilty of laches in not so doing. The trial court refused the injunction and dismissed the bill, without opinion or findings of fact.\n The Supreme Court of Missouri held, on appeal, that relief from the alleged discriminatory assessment could not be had in any suit at law; that his bill in equity was the appropriate and only remedy, unless relief could have been had by timely application to some administrative board; and that neither of the boards of equalization was charged with the power and duty to grant such relief. But, without passing definitely upon the question of discrimination, it concluded that if the plaintiff had 'at any time before the tax books were delivered to the collector, filed complaint with the state tax commission, that body, in the proper exercise of its jurisdiction. would have granted a hearing, and would have heard evidence with respect to the valuations complained of, and, if the charges contained in the complaint had been found to be true, the valuations placed on its property would have been lowered, or that on other property raised, the property omitted from the assessment roll would have been placed thereon, and the discrimination complained of thereby removed. The remedy provided by statute is adequate, certain, and complete.' Compare First National Bank of Greeley v. Weld County, \n264 \nU.S. 450\n, 44 S. Ct. 385. The court held, therefore, that, because plaintiff had this ade- \n\n[281 U.S. 673, 676]\n\u00a0\n quate legal remedy, it was not entitled to equitable relief, and because plaintiff had not complained to the tax commission, 'it was clearly guilty of laches in not so doing.' On these grounds, the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. 19 S.W.(2d) 746.\n The powers and duties of the state tax commission are prescribed by article 4 of chapter 119 of the Revised Statutes of 1919 (sections 12828- 12852). Six years before this suit was begun, those provisions had been construed by the Supreme Court of Missouri in Laclede Land & Improvement Co. v. State Tax Commission, 295 Mo. 298, 243 S. W. 887. There, the court had been required to determine whether the commission had power to grant relief of the character here sought. The commission had refused, on the ground of lack of power, an application for relief from discrimination similar to that here alleged. The Laclede Company petitioned for a mandamus to compel the commission to hear its complaint. The Supreme Court denied the petition, saying that it was 'preposterous' and 'unthinkable' that the statute conferred such power on the commission; and that if the statute were thus construed, it would violate section 10 of article 10 of the Constitution of Missouri. That decision was thereafter consistently acted upon by the commission; and it was followed by the Supreme Court itself in later cases. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[281 U.S. 673, 677]\n\u00a0\n No one doubted the authority of the Laclede Case until it was expressly overruled in the case at bar. \n2\n While the defendant's answer asserted that the plaintiff had not availed itself of the administrative remedies under articles 3 and 5 of chapter 119 by application to the boards of equalization and was guilty of laches in not so doing ( contentions which the state court held to be unsound), the answer significantly omitted any contention that there had been a remedy by application to the state tax commission, whose powers are dealt with in the intervening article 4. The possibility of relief before the tax commission was not suggested by any one in the entire litigation until the Supreme Court filed its opinion on June 29, 1929. Then it was too late for the plaintiff to avail itself of the newly found remedy. For, under that decision, the application to the tax commission could not be made after the tax books were delivered to the collector; and this had been done about October 1, 1927\n\n\n The plaintiff seasonably filed a petition for a rehearing in which it recited the above facts and asserted, in addition to its claims on the merits, that, in applying the new construction of article 4 of chapter 119 to the case at bar, and in refusing relief because of the newly found powers of the commission, the court transgressed the due \n\n[281 U.S. 673, 678]\n\u00a0\n process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The additional federal claim thus made was timely, since it was raised at the first opportunity. Missouri ex rel. Missouri Ins. Co. v. Gehner, \n281 \nU.S. 313\n, 50 S. Ct. 326, 74 L. Ed. -. The petition was denied without opinion. This court granted certiorari. \n280 \nU.S. 550\n, 50 S. Ct. 152, 74 L. Ed. -. We are of opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri must be reversed, because it has denied to the plaintiff 'due process of law'-using that term in its primary sense of an opportunity to be heard and to defend its substantive right.\n First. It is plain that the practical effect of the judgment of the Missouri court is to deprive the plaintiff of property without affording it at any time an opportunity to be heard in its defense. The plaintiff asserted an invasion of its substantive right under the federal Constitution to equality of treatment. Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499\n, 37 S. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88; Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County, \n260 \nU.S. 441\n, 43 S. Ct. 190, 28 A. L. R. 979. If the allegations of the complaint could be established, the federal Constitution conferred upon the plaintiff the right to have the assessments abated by 25 per cent. In order to protect its property from being seized in payment of the part of the tax alleged to be unlawful, the plaintiff invoked the appropriate judicial remedy provided by the state. Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 U.S. 1\n, 55- 57, 32 S. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44.\n Under the settled law of the state, that remedy was the only one available. That a bill in equity is appropriate and that the court has power to grant relief, even under the new construction of the statute dealing with the tax commission, is not questioned. \n3\n And it is held by the state court in this case that no other judicial remedy is open to the plaintiff and that no administrative \n\n[281 U.S. 673, 679]\n\u00a0\n remedy, other than that before the state tax commission, has been provided. But, after the decision in the Laclede Case, it would have been entirely futile for the plaintiff to apply to the commission. That body had persistently refused to entertain such applications; and the Supreme Court of the state had supported it in its refusal. Thus, until June 29, 1929, when the opinion in the case at bar was delivered, the tax commission could not, because of the rule of the Laclede Case, grant the relief to which the plaintiff was entitled on the facts alleged. After June 29, 1929, the commission could not grant such relief to this plaintiff because, under the decision of the court in this case, the time in which the commission could act had long expired. Obviously, therefore, at no time did the state provide to the plaintiff an administrative remedy against the alleged illegal tax; and in invoking the appropriate judicial remedy, the plaintiff did not omit to comply with any existing condition precedent. Montana National Bank v. Yellowstone County, \n276 \nU.S. 499, 505\n, 48 S. Ct. 331.\n If the judgment is permitted to stand, deprivation of plaintiff's property is accomplished without its ever having had an opportunity to defend against the exaction. The state court refused to hear the plaintiff's complaint and denied it relief, and because of lack of power or because of any demerit in the complaint, but because, assuming power and merit, the plaintiff did not first seek an administrative remedy which, in fact was never available and which is not now open to it. Thus, by denying to it the only remedy ever available for the enforcement of its right to prevent the seizure of its property, the judgment deprives the plaintiff of its property.\n Second. If the result above stated were attained by an exercise of the state's legislative power, the transgression of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \n\n[281 U.S. 673, 680]\n\u00a0\n would be obvious. Ettor v. Tacoma, \n228 \nU.S. 148\n, 33 S. Ct. 428.4 The violation is none the less clear when that result is accomplished by the state judiciary in the course of construing an otherwise valid (First National Bank of Greeley v. Weld County, \n264 \nU.S. 450\n, 44 S. Ct. 385) state statute. The federal guaranty of due process extends to state action through its judicial as well as through its legislative, executive, or administrative branch of government. \n 5\n\u00a0\n\n It is true that the courts of a state have the supreme power to interpret and declare the written and unwritten laws of the state; that this court's power to review decisions of state courts is limited to their decisions on federal questions;6 and that the mere fact that a state court has rendered an erroneous decision on a question of state law, or has overruled principles or doctrines established by previous decisions on which a party relied, does not give rise to a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment or otherwise confer appellate jurisdiction on this court. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[281 U.S. 673, 681]\n\u00a0\n But our decision in the case at bar is not based on the ground that there has been a retrospective denial of the existence of any right or a retroactive change in the law of remedies. We are not now concerned with the rights of the plaintiff on the merits, although it may be observed that the plaintiff's claim is one arising under the federal Constitution and, consequently, one on which the opinion of the state court is not final; or with the accuracy of the state court's construction of the statute in either the Laclede Case or in the case at bar. Our present concern is solely with the question whether the plaintiff has been accorded due process in the primary sense-whether it has had an opportunity to present its case and be heard in its support. Undoubtedly, the state court had the power to construe the statute dealing with the state tax commission; and to re-examine and overrule the Laclede Case. Neither of these matters raises a federal question; neither is subject to our review. \n8\n But, \n\n[281 U.S. 673, 682]\n\u00a0\n while it is for the state courts to determine the adjective as well as the substantive law of the state, they must, in so doing, accord the parties due process of law. Whether acting through its judiciary or through its Legislature, a state may not deprive a person of all existing remedies for the enforcement of a right, which the state has no power to destroy, unless there is, or was, afforded to him some real opportunity to protect it. \n9\n Compare Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Newport, \n247 \nU.S. 464, 475\n, 476 S., 38 S. Ct. 566.\n Third. The court's finding of laches was predicated entirely on the plaintiff's failure to apply to the state tax commission. In view of what we have said, this ground is not sufficient independently to support the judgment. And, as the Supreme Court of Missouri did not decide whether the allegations of the plaintiff's bill were sustained by the proof, we do not inquire into the merits of the plaintiff's claim under the equal protection clause. The judgment is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS did not hear the argument and took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In Boonville National Bank v. Schlotzhauer, 317 Mo. 1298, 298 S. W. 732, 55 A. L. R. 489, where the taxpayer was represented by the same counsel who represent the plaintiff here, relief was sought by bill in equity from like discrimination, without prior application to the state tax commission. The Supreme Court of Missouri was required to decide whether the taxpayer had invoked the appropriate remedy; and it held, in an elaborate opinion which did not mention the tax commission, that the remedy pursued was the appropriate one and that the taxpayer was entitled to relief thereby, if the facts alleged were proved. See also Jefferson City Bridge & Transit Co. v. Blaser, 318 Mo. 373, 300 S. W. 778; Columbia Terminals Co. v. Koeln, 319 Mo. 445, 3 S.W.(2d) 1021; State v.

Sup.) 11 S.W.(2d) 38. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The reason which prompted the Supreme Court to re-examine and overrule the Laclede Case is thus stated in its opinion: It is doubtful whether the evidence in this case warrants a finding that the local assessor intentionally and systematically undervalued real estate and personal property listed with him, other than bank stock; but there can be no question but that his failure to assess sucking animals and poultry was both intentional and pursuant to system. ... If the owners of bank stock are entitled to an abatement of a portion of their taxes because other property was undervalued, it would appear on principle that all taxpayers of the state should be entirely relieved, so far as the taxes for 1927 are concerned, because the owners of poultry were not taxed at all. It seems necessary that we rechart our course.' 19 S.W.(2d) 746, 749. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Equitable relief was denied solely on the equitable doctrines that the plaintiff had an adequate legal remedy by application to the Commission and was guilty of laches in not pursuing it. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Compare Turner v.

Ct. 582. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The process of trial and error, of change of decision in order to conform with changing ideas and conditions, is traditional with courts administering the common law. Since it is for the state courts to interpret and declare the law of the State, it is for them to correct their errors and declare what the law has been as well as what it is. State courts, like this Court, may ordinarily overrule their own decisions without offending constitutional guaranties, even though parties may have acted to their prejudice on the faith of the earlier decisions. The doctrine of Gelpcke v. Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175, and Butz v. Muscatine, 8 Wall. 575, like that of Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, is, if applied at all, confined strictly to cases arising in the federal courts. Fleming v. Fleming, \n264 \nU.S. 29, 31\n, 44 S. Ct. 246; Tidal Oil Co. v.

Likewise, if the administrative remedy were still available to the plaintiff, there would be no denial of due process in that regard. \n\n\n\n\n","14":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROAD RIVER POWER CO. v. SOUTH CAROLINA(1930)\nNo. 528\nArgued: May 2, 1930Decided: May 19, 1930\n\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 537, 539]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. Marshall Bullitt, of Louisville, Ky., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Cordie Page and Irvine F. Belser, both of Columbia, S. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari, \n280 \nU.S. 551\n, 50 S. Ct. 162, 74 L. Ed. -, to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina, adjudging the petitioners, the Broad River Power Company and its subsidiary, the Columbia Railway Cas & Electric Company, to be jointly responsible for the operation of an electric street railway system in Columbia, S. C., and directing them to resume its operation, which they had abandoned. 154 S. C. -, 153 S. E. 537. The proceeding, in the nature of mandamus, was brought in the state Supreme Court to compel the operation of the system by petitioners. By their answer they set up that the railway was being operated by the railway company at a loss under a franchise separate and distinct from the franchise to make and distribute electric light and power of the Broad River Power Company, whose business is concededly profitable; that the continued operation of the railway under compulsion of the court would deprive respondents of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. \n\n[281 U.S. 537, 540]\n\u00a0\n The Supreme Court, upon consideration of the evidence taken before a referee, held (a) that, although the books of the street railway showed large financial losses, it could be operated at a profit if properly managed; (b) that the charter and certain city ordinances under which the street railway system was constructed and operated, and certain extension line and right of way agreements, are effective as contracts imposing on petitioners a duty to operate the system; and (c) that the privilege of operating the street railway is inseparable from that of operating the electric power and light system, and that together they constitute a unified franchise, which cannot be abandoned in part and retained in part without the consent of the state; that so long as respondents retain and operate their electric power system they cannot be permitted to abandon their street railway system. Each of these conclusions is sharply challenged by respondents, but, in the view we take, only the third need be considered here.\n Whether the state court has denied to rights asserted under local law the protection which the Constitution guarantees is a question upon which the petitioners are entitled to invoke the judgment of this Court. Even though the constitutional protection invoked be denied on nonfederal grounds, it is the province of this Court to inquire whether the decision of the state court rests upon a fair or substantial basis. If unsubstantial, constitutional obligations may not be thus evaded. Fox River Paper Co. v. Railroad Commission of Wisconsin, \n274 \nU.S. 651, 655\n, 47 S. Ct. 669; Ward v.

Ct. 686, this Court will not inquire whether the rule applied by the state court is right or wrong, or substitute its own view of what should be deemed the better rule for that of the state court.\n The predecessor in interest of the Columbia Electric Gas & Railway Company, the petitioner, was incorporated in 1890 by special act of the Legislature, S. C. Acts of 1890, p. 969, under the name of Columbia Electric Street & Suburban Railway & Electric Power Company, later changed to the Columbia Electric Street Railway Light & Power Company, called the Consolidated Company and, still later, in 1911, changed to its present name. Its corporate life was fixed at thirty years and it was given power, upon the consent of the city council, to construct or acquire railway tracks through any streets of the city of Columbia, to extend them into the country a distance of five miles from the state capital, and to operate cars with electric power over its tracks for the transportation of passengers and freight and to contract for and provide electric power for any other purpose. The act was continued in force provided the 'company begins to operate its railways in said city within five years.'\n An Act of December 16, 1891, S. C. Acts of 1891, p. 1453, authorized the consolidation of this company with the Congaree Gas & Electric Company. The latter had been incorporated under the Act of December 24, 1887, S. C. Acts of 1887, p. 1103, for a period of thirty years, with the power, not now involved, to manufacture and distribute gas, and power to sell and distribute light, power, and heat 'made from electricity,' and for that purpose, subject to municipal ordinances, to erect poles and conductors. The Consolidation Act recited that these two companies had agreed to consolidate their franchises and privileges, and authorized them to do so by \n\n[281 U.S. 537, 542]\n\u00a0\n transfer of their property, franchises, and privileges by deed of indenture to the new consolidated company. This company was incorporated for fifty years, with the usual corporate powers. The act provided that it should be vested with the franchises and subject to the liabilities of the consolidated companies. It was also authorized to acquire the property and franchise of the Columbia Street Railway Company, incorporated for thirty years by Act of February 9, 1882 (17 St. at Large, p. 876), with a franchise to operate horse cars over tracks in the city streets.\n The consolidation was effected as authorized. The Consolidated Company acquired the line of street railway of the horse car company, established electric power plants and, under authority of City Ordinance ,  561, 562, of 1892, laid additional tracks and electrified the system by erecting poles and wires in the streets; also, so far as practicable, using them and its rights of way in its electric light and power business. from the organization of the Consolidated Company until 1925, both the street railway and power business of the Consolidated Company were expanded as a single business, its capital stock was increased from time to time, and the system of accounts was such that it did not disclose whether its power system was constructed more from the proceeds of its street railway or its power business.\n Certain facts in this recital of corporate history are of persuasive if not controlling significance in determining the status of the franchise of the Consolidated Company. The Consolidated Company was a new corporation. Its franchises and privileges were granted for its corporate life, extending beyond the duration of the franchises of the two companies consolidated, all of which would have expired before 1921. It had acquired the franchises of the two consolidated companies, one in terms a franchise to operate a railway and a power system, the railway system being for practical purposes dependent upon the \n\n[281 U.S. 537, 543]\n\u00a0\n power system for its operation, and the privilege of operating both being conditional upon the establishment of the railway system within five years. The Consolidation Act plainly looked to a consolidation of the franchises by the two companies. None of the special legislative acts defining the privileges conferred upon these several corporations contains any words affirmatively providing that any part of the privileges granted should be deemed separable, or that they might be exercised independently of any other.\n The Supreme Court of South Carolina, in referring to this corporate history and the effect of the Consolidation Act, said (page ___ of 154 S. C., 153 S. E. 550): 'When the new company in compliance with this act effected the consolidation, and in pursuance of the provisions of the act, built, constructed, and operated, its electric railway, light and power properties, as parts of one business for nearly 40 years,' these rights, powers, and privileges became inseparably bound together and cannot be separated. As contended by the petitioners (respondents here), 'such diversity as there was in the conditions of the former franchises became obliterated and extinguished by the major purpose of the new Act-namely the consolidation of all powers into one Company for the greater benefit of the public.\"\n In the light of the familiar rule that franchises are to be strictly construed, and that construction adopted which works the least harm to the public, see Blair v. Chicago, \n201 \nU.S. 400, 471\n, 26 S. Ct. 427; Northwestern Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park, \n97 U.S. 659\n, 666; Slidell v. Grandjean, \n111 \nU.S. 412\n, 4 S. Ct. 475, we cannot say that this interpretation of statutes of the state of South Carolina, by its highest court, so departs from established principles as to be without substantial basis, or presents any ground for the protection, under the Constitution, of rights or immunities which the state court has found to be nonexistent. It follows that it was within the constitutional power of the state to refuse to \n\n[281 U.S. 537, 544]\n\u00a0\n permit any partial abandonment of the consolidated franchise. United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission of Kentucky, \n278 \nU.S. 300, 308\n, 49 S. Ct. 150; Fort Smith, Light & Traction Co. v. Bourland, \n267 \nU.S. 330\n, 45 S. Ct. 249; Puget Sound Traction Co. v.

Ct. 183, upon which petitioners rely, is not apposite. It was there held that, where a railroad serving the public is owned and operated by a corporation which also conducted a private business, it is the business of the railroad and not the entire business of the company which determined whether the railroad franchise may be abandoned as unprofitable. The private business was not devoted to a public use or a part of the public franchise. Nor, as petitioners contend, are we here concerned with the rule that a public service company may not be compelled to serve, even in a branch of its business, at a rate which is confiscatory. See Northern Pacific R. R. Co. v. North Dakota, \n236 \nU.S. 585\n, 35 S. Ct. 429, L. R. A. 1917F, 1148, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 1. The order compelling petitioners to serve does not involve a determination whether or not the rate is confiscatory, nor does it foreclose a consideration of that question upon appropriate proceedings. Woodhaven Gas Light Co. v. Public Service Comm'n of N. Y., supra, page 249 of \n269 U.S. 46\n S. Ct. 83.\n But petitioners contend that, even if the franchise of the Consolidated Company be deemed a unified one, the privilege of operating the street railway system was separated from the franchise to operate the power system by the corporate reorganization under the so-called Merger Act of March 19, 1925, S. C. Acts of 1925, p. 842. \n\n[281 U.S. 537, 545]\n\u00a0\n The passage of this act was procured by those interested in promoting the interests of the Consolidated Company and its subsidiaries, apparently for the purpose of facilitating the financing of the power business apart from the street railway business. It is entitled 'An Act to Authorize' the Consolidated and six other named companies, or any of them, 'to Merge, Consolidate or Sell, Transfer and Convey all or Any Part of Their Respective Properties, Assets, Franchises and Charter or Other Rights to Any One or More of Them or to Broad River Power Company ... and to Authorize the Broad River Power Company or Any One or More of Them to Merge, Consolidate or Purchase the Same and to Vest in Said Broad River Power Company or Any Other of Said Companies the Property, Assets, Franchises and Charter or Other Rights so Sold, Transferred, Conveyed, Merged, Consolidated or Purchased ....' Section 1, entitled 'Merger of Certain Corporations Authorized,' permits the named companies or any of them 'to merge or consolidate with or to sell, transfer and convey to any one or more of them or to the Broad River Power Company all or any part of their respective properties, assets, franchises ... and each and every of said companies and the Broad River Power Company are hereby authorized to merge or consolidate with or to purchase and to receive and hold all or any part of the properties, assets, franchises ... so sold, transferred and conveyed. ...' Section 2 declares 'that in furtherance of the purposes of Section 1 ... all franchises heretofore granted by the State to any of the said companies may be transferred and assigned in pursuance of the provisions of Section 1 of this Act,' and that the company to which the transfer is made 'shall hold the same with all the rights, powers and privileges granted to the original holder thereof, subject only to the restrictions, requirements and conditions in said franchises contained.' \n\n[281 U.S. 537, 546]\n\u00a0\n The Broad River Power Company had been organized in July, 1924, for the purpose of acquiring the entire outstanding capital stock of the Consolidated Company. Proceeding under the Merger Act, all the property and franchises of the six subsidiaries, excepting only the street railway property and so much of its franchises as authorized it to operate and maintain its street railway system, were vested in the Broad River Company. That company thus acquired the entire power business, leaving only the street car business and property in the Consolidated Company. The deed, however, expressly conveyed to the Broad River Power Company all its poles, including those used for the street railway, which carried both the trolley wires for the operation of the street railway and those for the transmission of other electric power. The Broad River Power Company then issued its own stock to the extent of approximately three and a half million dollars in exchange for the common stock of the Consolidated Company and one of its subsidiaries, and for certain cash subscriptions. After the acquisition of the common stock of the Consolidated Company by the Broad River Company, the capital stock of the former was reduced to a relatively nominal amount, all of which was held by the Broad River Company, except 190 shares of preferred stock which remained outstanding. The record indicates that the petitioners have deposited a fund in a special bank account for the retirement of this stock. Since this reorganization, the same persons have been executive officers of the Broad River Company and the Consolidated Company, and for all practical purposes the railway business of the Consolidated Company has been carried on as a branch or department of the Broad River Power Company.\n Upon these and more detailed findings of fact both the referee and the state court held that the reorganization resulted in a merger by which all the properties and \n\n[281 U.S. 537, 547]\n\u00a0\n franchises of the several companies concerned were brought under the complete domination and control of the Broad River Power Company, which carried on the street railway branch of its business through the merely nominal agency of the Consolidated Company. For that reason the Supreme Court reached the conclusion that there had been no effective splitting up of the franchise or the public obligations of the Consolidated Company, and that they had devolved upon the Broad River Power Company, which was liable to carry out the obligation of the Columbia Gas & Electric Company to furnish an electric street railway service.\n But we need not consider this aspect of the case, for we think that there was substantial basis for the further conclusion of the state court that the Merger Act cannot be taken to authorize the breaking up of the unified franchise of the Consolidated Company in such manner as to relieve it or any successor company from its duties and obligations as they existed before the merger. Nowhere in this legislation is there any affirmative disclosure of a purpose to relieve any of the corporations of existing duties and obligations or to enlarge their privileges. As appears from the title of the act and also that of section 1, the dominant purpose was to effect a merger or consolidation. The authority given by section 1 to transfer 'all or any part' of the franchises affords but slender basis for the argument that there was any purpose to effect such a separation. The use of this phrase seems only subsidiary to the dominant purpose to authorize a merger or consolidation. It is not repeated or in terms referred to in section 2, which deals with franchises, and it is declared to be in furtherance of the purpose of section 1. In any case, the limitation in this section that the company acquiring any franchise shall take it subject to existing restrictions, requirements, and conditions may, we think, reasonably be deemed to preclude the possibility of relieving from franchise duties \n\n[281 U.S. 537, 548]\n\u00a0\n and obligations when no such purpose is disclosed in the body of the legislative act.\n The very fact that legislative acts of this character are commonly prepared by those interested in the benefits to be derived from them, and that the public interest requires that they should be in such unequivocal form that the legislative mind may be impressed with their character and import so that privileges may be intelligently granted or purposely withheld, has firmly established the rule that they must be strictly construed, and that any ambiguity or doubts as to their meaning and purpose must be resolved in favor of the public interest. See Blair v. Chicago, supra, page 471 of 201 U. S., 26 S. Ct. 427. Northwestern Fertilizer Company v. Hyde Park, supra, page 666 of 97 U. S.. 'The rule is a wise one; it serves to defeat any purpose concealed by the skillful use of terms, to accomplish something not apparent on the face of the act, and thus sanctions only open dealing with legislative bodies.' Slidell v. Grandjean, supra, page 438 of 111 U. S., 4 S. Ct. 475, 487.\n We conclude that the judgment below is supported by a state ground which we may rightly accept as substantial.\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","15":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROAD RIVER POWER CO. v.

A rehearing afterwards was ordered by the Court (\n282 \nU.S. 795\n, 51 S. Ct. 38, 75 L. Ed. -) and the rehearing recently has been had. Upon this further consideration the Court adheres to the view that the writ of certiorari should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, but the members of the Court differ in the reasons which lead to that decision:\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur in this disposition of the case, upon the rehearing, for the following reasons: The state court found that the petitioners here 'did not make a bona fide effort to make the street railway business a success,' but planned to discontinue it and pursued a course tend- \n\n[282 U.S. 187, 193]\n\u00a0\n ing to depress the business and make it unremunerative; that 'if the street car system had been properly maintained, as it could and should have been, the same would have been patronized by the public generally'; and that the 'street railway system can be made to yield a fair return if properly managed and properly maintained.' These findings, although opposed to part of the evidence, have such support in other parts that they should be accepted here. In the presence of such findings, so supported, it is apparent that on the present record petitioners are not in a position to maintain that enforced operation of the street railway system will be in contravention of rights secured by the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. An essential basis in matter of fact for the right sought to be asserted under that constitutional provision is wanting; and, as this is true regardless of whether the electric street railway franchise be independent or so unified with other franchises as to be interdependent, there is no present need to consider or determine its status in that regard.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice HOLMES, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice STONE, adhere to the views expressed in the opinion heretofore delivered. \n281 \nU.S. 537\n, 50 S.

John Fletcher Caskey and Charles Dickerman Williams, both of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases deal with the power of the Commissioner of Prohibition to revoke basic permits to use intoxicating liquors in the manufacture of medicinal preparations. Section 6 of the National Prohibition Act, October 28, 1919, c. 85, title 2, 42 Stat. 305, 310 (27 USCA  16), declares: 'No one shall manufacture, sell, purchase, transport, or prescribe \n\n[281 U.S. 599, 602]\n\u00a0\n any liquor without first obtaining a permit from the commissioner so to do . ... All permits to manufacture, prescribe, sell, or transport liquor, may be issued for one year, and shall expire on the 31st day of December next succeeding the issuance thereof: Provided, ... That permits to purchase liquor for the purpose of manufacturing or selling as provided in this chapter shall not be in force to exceed ninety days from the day of issuance.'\n Section 4 of title 2 of the act (27 USCA  13) provides that the 'articles' therein enumerated, including toilet, medicinal and antiseptic preparations, although containing intoxicating liquor, 'shall not, after having been manufactured and prepared for the market, be subject to the provisions of' the act; and that the use of intoxicating liquor in the manufacture of such 'articles' is authorized under certain restrictions. Manufacturers are required under this section to procure two permits: One, the basic permit here involved, granting general authority to manufacture such preparations with an alcoholic content; the other, a supplemental permit granting special authority to purchase liquor for that purpose and limited by section 6 to not more than ninety days from the date of issuance. Treasury Dept., Bureau of Internal Revenue, Regulations 60 (1924 ),  200, 201, 221, 403; Prohibition Bureau, Regulations 2 (1927)  201, 203, 404.\n Section 5 of title 2 of the act (27 USCA  14) prescribes that, upon due notice and hearing, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (after Act of March 3, 1927, c. 348, 44 Stat. 1381 (5 USCA  281 et seq.)), the Commissioner of Prohibition) may revoke permits granted under section 4 for failure to conform the manufactured 'articles' with the 'descriptions and limitations' of that section; and gives to the manufacturer the right to have the action of the Commissioner reviewed 'by appropriate proceeding in a court of equity.' Section 9 of title 2 (27 USCA  21) provides that, upon due notice and hearing, the Commissioner may revoke the permit of 'any person who has a permit' and who \n\n[281 U.S. 599, 603]\n\u00a0\n 'is not in good faith conforming to the provisions of this chapter, or has violated the laws of any State relating to intoxicating liquor'; and subjects the action of the Commissioner to judicial review as provided in section 5. Compare Ma-King Products Co. v. Blair, \n271 \nU.S. 479\n, 46 S. Ct. 544\n\n\n For some years prior to October 1, 1927, the plaintiffs in these two cases had been engaged in the business of manufacturing medicinal preparations and held basic permits issued under section 4 of the act. Each permit authorizes the use of whisky in the manufacture of a particular product in accordance with a special formula; was issued pursuant to regulations in force at the time of issuance; and declares that it shall remain in force 'until revoked, suspended or renewed as provided by law or regulations.' \n1\n On September 2, 1927, the Treasury Department, Bureau of Prohibition, issued Regulations 2, effective October 1, 1927, in which it is provided by section 218 that 'all permits issued and in force and effect on the effective date of these regulations shall expire on December 31, 1928, unless renewed in the manner hereinafter specified, ...' and that thenceforth only annual permits shall be issued. 2 The provision was made ap- \n\n[281 U.S. 599, 604]\n\u00a0\n plicable to the basic permits issued under section 4 of the act to persons engaged in the business of manufacturing medicinal preparations 'that are unfit for use for beverage purposes.' The plaintiffs, without indicating any intention to waive their rights under existing permits and for the purpose of safeguarding themselves, accordingly filed applications for renewal of their permits.\n On December 1, 1928, the Commissioner of Prohibition, having concluded that the use of whisky by such permittees under section 4 was susceptible of grave abuse and that proper supervision of manufacturing operations involving the use of whisky could not be maintained by the inspection force, instructed all federal prohibition administrators to grant hearings to applicants for renewal of such permits for the purpose of determining whether or not whisky is a necessary ingredient in the articles produced by them; to afford them an opportunity to present such evidence as they could to establish that alcohol or other spirits would not properly serve for extraction and solution of the ingredients contained in their products and for the preservation thereof; and to deny permits for the use of whisky after December 31, 1928, unless its indispensability was clearly demonstrated. The Federal Administrator for the district, acting on these instructions, \n\n[281 U.S. 599, 605]\n\u00a0\n notified the several plaintiffs accordingly and fixed dates for their hearings. Compare Liscio v. Campbell (C. C. A.) 34 F.(2d) 646.\n These suits were then brought by the permittees in the federal court for Southern New York, against the Prohibition Administrator, the Commissioner of Prohibition, and the Secretary of the Treasury to enjoin them from enforcing section 218 of Regulations 2; from proceeding with the proposed hearings concerning the use of whisky; and from otherwise interfering with the permits held by them. The plaintiffs alleged that their permits contained no date of expiration and had never been revoked, canceled, or surrendered; that they were entitled to have their permits remain in force until they should be revoked pursuant to proceedings under sections 5 and 9; and that no proceeding for such revocation had been brought. They charged that in so far as Regulations 2 purported to revoke, limit, or suspend, without the hearing provided for in sections 5 and 9, permits theretofore granted to the plaintiffs, it is void as in violation of the act; that the proposed hearings are without legal warrant; and that the threatened action of denying the further use of whisky is unauthorized and illegal. The trial court granted an injunction in each case. 3 The decrees were affirmed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \n4\n Lion \n\n[281 U.S. 599, 606]\n\u00a0\n Laboratories, Inc. v. Campbell, 34 F.(2d) 642. This court granted writs of certiorari. Campbell v. Galeno Chemical Co., 280 U. S. -, 50 S. Ct. 85, 74 L. Ed. -.\n First. The government contends that section 1, title 2, of the act ( 27 USCA  4), defines the word 'liquor' as meaning not only the beverages specifically named but also any liquids 'containing one-half of 1 per centum or more of alcohol by volume which are fit for use for beverage purposes'; that liquids which are not immediately fit for use as beverages are yet 'fit for use for beverage purposes' if they can be made potable by a simple process; that plaintiffs' preparations are of that character;5 that they are expressly excluded from the act only 'after having been manufactured and prepared for the market'; that, \n\n[281 U.S. 599, 607]\n\u00a0\n at the time of manufacture and before preparation for the market, they fall within the term 'liquor' as used in the act; that permits to manufacture the 'articles' enumerated in section 4 of the act are, therefore, permits to manufacture 'liquor' within the meaning of the provision in section 6 that 'permits to manufacture, prescribe, sell, or transport liquor ... shall expire on the 31st day of December next succeeding the issuance thereof'; and that, although by their own terms the plaintiffs' permits are to be in force 'until revoked, suspended or renewed as provided by law or regulations,' they have expired ere this by the operation of section 6. Cywan v. Blair (D. C.) 16 F.(2d) 279; Chicago Grain Products Co. v. Mellon (C. C. A.) 14 F.(2d) 362.6\n We are of opinion that the quoted provision of section 6 is inapplicable to the permits held by the several plaintiffs. Whether or not the preparations manufactured by the plaintiffs are 'liquor' while being manufactured and before they are prepared for the market is wholly immaterial. We are not here concerned with the nature of the preparations in their varying stages of development. Our concern is with the object of the permits. This object, and the permission granted, is not simply to manufacture varyingly unfinished products; but to manufacture specified articles containing whisky, alcohol, or other spirits. The products are, by section 4, called 'articles' and are expressly excluded from the effect of the term 'liquor.' Moreover, section 4 authorizes the issuance of permits for the use of whisky, etc., in the manufacture of medicinal and \n\n[281 U.S. 599, 608]\n\u00a0\n other preparations only 'that are unfit for use for beverage purposes'; while 'liquor' is defined in section 1 as meaning liquids, in addition to those enumerated, 'Which are fit for use for beverage purposes.' The two definitions are mutually exclusive. If the article to be manufactured is fit for use for beverage purposes, and therefore liquor, a permit under section 4 cannot be issued; and vice versa. By express and obvious enactment, therefore, the permits held by the plaintiffs are not permits to manufacture liquor and are not within the expiration limit prescribed by section 6.\n Second. The government contends also that because plaintiffs' permits, whatever their character, do not provide a calendar date of expiration, they are void or voidable for failure to comply with the further provision of section 6 that every permit 'shall designate and limit the acts that are permitted and the time when and place where such acts may be performed,' even though they complied with the regulations in force at the time of issuance. This contention rests wholly upon the assertion that the grant of a permit to be in force until 'revoked, suspended or renewed as provided by law or regulation' is not definite.\n It has been questioned whether Congress intended to make this provision apply to permits issued under section 4; but we do not express any opinion on that question. Even if applicable, this provision in section 6 does not declare that permits must expire by the calendar. The limitation that the permits shall be in force until revoked, suspended, or renewed in accordance with the law or regulations is a sufficient compliance with the general requirement of the designation of the time when the permitted acts may be performed. When a calendar date is required, section 6 so states specifically. Ninety days for permits to purchase liquor for the purpose of manufacturing and selling; thirty days for permits to purchase for any other purpose; December 31st next succeeding the date of issuance for permits to manufacture, prescribe, sell, or transport liquor. \n\n[281 U.S. 599, 609]\n\u00a0\n It is true that permits for short periods terminating upon definite dates would leave the Bureau much freer in the exercise of its discretion than it could be under indeterminate permits revocable only for cause, established pursuant to sections 5 or 9. Every permittee applying for a renewal has the burden of establishing his fitness; whereas, if permits are terminable only by revocation pursuant to the provisions in sections 5 and 9, the burden to justify closing the business because of some violation of the act or of the regulations is put upon the government. But section 6, as well as the rest of the act, draws an obvious distinction between the manufacture, etc., of intoxicating liquor and that of industrial alcohol and the preparations enumerated in section 4. The former is forbidden, except for certain specified purposes for which liquor is deemed necessary. The latter is ordinarily lawful; and it is the express purpose of the act to encourage it. United States v. Katz, \n271 \nU.S. 354, 359\n, 46 S. Ct. 513. Regulations are imposed only for the purpose of guarding against the diversion of this lawful business into the unlawful business of supplying intoxicating liquor. 7 It is entirely consistent with the avowed purposes of the act, that the restrictions on the one business should be more severe than those on the other.\n Third. Finally, the government contends that even if Congress did not provide for the termination on some definite date of permits issued under section 4, it left the matter continuously open to control by regulations to be issued from time to time; that sections 5 and 9 are not limitations upon this quasi-legislative police power; that the express provisions of the permits cannot have the effect of bargaining away such later exercise of that power as may be deemed appropriate; and that the regulation of \n\n[281 U.S. 599, 610]\n\u00a0\n October 1, 1927, is a valid exercise of that power. This contention, also, is unsound.\n The limits of the power to issue regulations are well settled. International Ry. Co. v. Davidson, \n257 \nU.S. 506, 514\n, 42 S. Ct. 179. They may not extend a statute or modify its provisions. The regulation of October 1, 1927, purports to revoke unexpired permits as of December 31, 1928, without resort to the proceedings prescribed by sections 5 and 9. It thus attempts to deprive permittees of rights secured to them by these sections of the act. As was said in Higgins v. Foster (C. C. A.) 12 F.(2d) 646, 648: 'We cannot see that the Commissioner, under the guise of legislation, may do in gross what he had no power to do in detail.' Whether or not the power to make regulations, or the provision in section 6, authorizes the Bureau to fix expiration dates for permits when issued, it does not authorize the revocation of existing permits in violation of the express provisions of the act.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The permits provide also: 'If this permit requires a supporting bond, the failure to keep such bond in force will ipso facto suspend this permit; and this permit may be revoked, supended, modified, amended, supplemented, extended, or renewed in the manner and for the causes set forth in regulations 60, or specifically set forth herein, or agreed to by the permittee, or otherwise provided by law.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The original regulations issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue under title 2 of the act, called Regulations 60, effective January 17, 1920, provided in section 18 for permits of annual duration only. On March 14, 1924, Regulations 60 were revised and section 260 provided that all basic permits should be of annual duration; but that type 'H' permits to use liquor in the manufacture of articles 'unfit for use for beverage purposes,' which are the permits held by these plaintiffs, should be valid 'so long as the supporting bond required by these regulations remains in full force and effect, or until canceled, suspended, revoked, or voluntarily surrendered by the permittee.' Internal Revenue Treasury Decision 3773, made on November 14, 1925, announced that all permits theretofore granted would expire on December 21, 1925, and that thereafter only annual permits would be issued. See also T. D. 3774. The decision was declared void on June 1, 1926, by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Higgins v. Foster, 12 F.(2d) 646. Thereupon, the Bureau, by T. D. 3925, approved on September 1, 1926, declared that 'H' permits would be deemed valid until surrendered or revoked. But on November 9, 1926, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held in Chicago Grain Products Co. v. Mellon, 14 F.(2d) 362, that a permit to manufacture denatured alcohol was subject to the one year limitation prescribed by section 6 of the act. Thereafter, section 218 here in question was incorporated in Regulations 2, revising Regulations 60. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The injunctions granted were interlocutory only. As to two of the original plaintiffs, Lion Laboratories, Inc., and Max Daub, an order of dismissal was granted, because their permits had expired by the express terms contained therein. These two plaintiffs appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, where the dismissal was affirmed. But they are not parties in this court. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue had been joined as defendant; but the Circuit Court of Appeals held he was not a proper party and the bills were dismissed as against him. The plaintiffs acquiesced in this holding. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] In the Circuit Court of Appeals, the cases were presented by all parties as tests of the merits of the bills. That court, therefore, passed 'the question whether it was proper to grant an injunction pendente lite at all,' saying: 'If the bill rested upon section 9 of title 2, National Prohibition Act (27 USCA  21), certainly it was not; if it depended upon the general equity powers of the court, we do not decide whether the policy manifested in section 9 applies, when there has been no hearing before the commissioner, and when, as here, the revocation was by regulation (section 218, Regulation 2, Oct. 1, 1927).' 34 F. (2d) 642, 643. In this court, too, the decrees were treated as final decrees on the merits of the bills.\n The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals on the merits is in accord with its prior decision in Higgins v. Foster, supra, note 2, and with Casper v. Doran, 30 F.(2d) 400 (D. C. E. D. Pa.), but is in direct conflict with the Chicago Grain Products Case, supra, note 2, and also with Cywan v. Blair, 16 F. (2d) 279 (D. C. N. D. Ill.), which expressly refused to follow the Higgins Case. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The argument is that pure alcohol is not immediately fit for beverage use; but that it may be mediately fitted for that purpose by adding water. Alcohol is unquestionably liquor. It is therefore urged that the same is true of any liquid which, like alcohol, is immediately or mediately fit for use as a beverage and otherwise answers the definition of 'liquor.' Aside from the argument developed in the text, there are two short answers to this contention. First, alcohol is expressly included in the definition of 'liquor' in section 1. No argument can, therefore, be based on the fact that pure alcohol is not immediately fit for use as a beverage. Second, there is no evidence whatever in the record that the plaintiffs' preparations can mediately be fitted for that purpose by the simple process of adding water, or by any other process. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It is unnecessary for us to consider in these cases whether future applicants for basic permits under section 4 may insist on the grant of permits containing no calendar date of expiration; or whether future permits may properly restrict the use of whiskey only to cases where whiskey is an absolutely necessary ingredient and no other spirits or alcohol will properly serve for the extraction and solution of ingredients contained in the preparations and for the proper preservation thereof. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Compare 'Industrial Alcohol,' a monograph issued by the Treasury Department, Bureau of Prohibition (Gov't Ptg.

Ed. -, decided this day, and involve, in the main, the same questions.\n In Nos. 445 and 510, the permits involved authorize the operation of denaturing plants, the purchase and receipt of alcohol thereat, and the removal therefrom of the denatured alcohol. In No. 511, the permit authorizes the use of specially denatured alcohol1 in the manufacture of toilet preparations. 2 In each of the three cases the permit was issued prior to October 1, 1927, and was in accordance with the regulations in force at the date of issuance. \n3\n Each permit provides in terms that it shall be in force 'from the date hereof until surrendered by the holder or cancelled by the Commissioner of Internal \n\n[281 U.S. 610, 614]\n\u00a0\n Revenue for violation of the national prohibition act 4 or regulations made pursuant thereto.'\n While the permits of the several plaintiffs were still in force, the Treasury Department, Bureau of Prohibition, promulgated Regulations 3, effective October 1, 1927. Article 95 thereof provides that all basic permits theretofore issued to operate denaturing plants and manufacture denatured alcohol shall expire on December 31, 1928, unless renewed; and that thereafter only annual permits shall be issued. Article 113 makes the same provision for permits to use specially denatured alcohol in the manufacture of toilet and other preparations. The plaintiffs, insisting on the effectiveness of their original permits, filed applications for renewal, which were denied. These suits were then brought to enjoin interference with their permits otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of section 9 of the act (27 USCA  21), considered in the Galeno Case. In No. 445 an injunction was issued by the trial court; the decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ( 34 F.(2d) 645); and we granted certiorari (\n280 \nU.S. 548\n, 50 S. Ct. 85, 74 L. Ed. -). Injunctions were granted by the trial court also in Nos. 510 and 511 (30 F.(2d) 4005); appeals were taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit; and these cases are here on certificates from that court.\n Among the 'articles' enumerated in section 4, title 2, of the National Prohibition Act (Oct. 28, 1919, c. 85, 41 Stat. 305, 309 (27 USCA  13)), which may be manufactured with the use of liquor, under permits, and which are excepted from operation of the act 'after having been manufactured and prepared for the market,' are: '(a) Denatured al- \n\n[281 U.S. 610, 615]\n\u00a0\n cohol ... produced and used as provided by laws and regulations now or hereafter in force. ... (d) Toilet ... preparations and solutions that are unfit for use for beverage purposes.' Title 3, headed 'Industrial Alcohol,' provides, in section 10 (27 USCA  80): 'Upon the filing of application and bond and issuance of permit denaturing plants may be established ... and shall be used exclusively for the denaturation of alcohol by the admixture of such denaturing materials as shall render the alcohol, or any compound in which it is authorized to be used, unfit for use as an intoxicating beverage. Alcohol lawfully denatured may, under regulations, be sold free of tax either for domestic use or for export.' There is no provision in the act specifically requiring permits for the manufacture of toilet preparations with denatured alcohol.\n First. The contentions of the government in Nos. 445 and 510 are those already considered in Campbell v. Galeno Chemical Co., supra. The questions certified in No. 510 are:\n'1. Is denatured alcohol, during its manufacture and preparation for the market, 'liquor' within the meaning of sections 1 and 6, Title II of the national prohibition act, the latter of which provides that permits to manufacture 'liquor' may be issued for only one year?\n\n'2. Does the provision of section 6, Title II of the national prohibition act, which directs that every permit 'shall designate and limit the ... time when' the authorized acts may be performed, apply to a permit to operate a denaturing plant, i. e., to use alcohol in the manufacture of denatured alcohol?\n\n'3. Does a provision in a permit that it shall be in force until 'surrendered by the holder or canceled by the Commission of Internal Revenue for violation of the national prohibition act or regulations made pursuant thereto,' comply with the above-mentioned requirement of section 6 of Title II of the national prohibition act, that \n\n[281 U.S. 610, 616]\n\u00a0\n every permit 'shall designate and limit the ... time when' the authorized acts may be performed?\n\n'4. May a permit to operate a denaturing plant, which permit provides that it shall be in force 'until surrendered by the holder or canceled by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for violation of the national prohibition act or regulations made pursuant thereto,' be terminated by a general regulation providing that all such permits shall expire on a date named?'\n\n We interpret the first question as inquiring whether a permit to manufacture denatured alcohol is a permit to manufacture liquor within the cited provision of title 2,  6 (27 USCA  16).6 As thus construed, we answer it in the negative. For, whether issued under section 4, title 2 ( 27 USCA  13), or under section 10, title 3 (27 USCA  80), the permits held by plaintiffs authorize them to convert something which is undoubtedly liquor into a product which is required to be unfit for use as a beverage; that is, to convert liquor into something which is not liquor. 7 Campbell v. Galeno Chemical Co., supra. For \n\n[281 U.S. 610, 617]\n\u00a0\n the reasons stated in that case, our answer to the third question is in the affirmative; and to the fourth question in the negative. In view of the answer to the third question, the second question need not be answered.\n Second. In No. 511, the Circuit Court of Appeals certified the following questions:\n'1. Does the provision of section 6, Title II, of the national prohibition act, which directs that every permit 'shall designate and limit the ... time when' the authorized acts may be performed, apply to a permit to use specially denatured alcohol?\n\n'2. (Same as question 3 in No. 510).8\n\n'3. May a permit to use specially denatured alcohol in the manufacture of toilet preparations, which permit provides that it shall 'be in effect until surrendered by the holder or cancelled by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for violation of the provisions of Title III of the national prohibition act or the regulations made pursuant thereto,' be terminated by a general regulation providing that all such permits shall expire on a date named?'\n\n In this court, the government concedes that the permit here involved is not one to manufacture liquor within the meaning of either the special or the general time provisions of title 2,  6. It contends, however, that since toilet preparations and denatured alcohol used in their manufacture are both excluded by title 2,  4 from the operation of the act, the plaintiff's business is not one for which a permit is required by the statute; that if the plaintiff used so-called completely denatured alcohol, no permit would be required at all (Regulations 61 (1920), art. 108; Regulations 3 (1927), art. 106); that permits for the use of specially denatured alcohol are required only by the regulations of the Bureau pursuant to its general authority, conferred, among other sections, by section 13, title 3 (27 USCA  83), to \n\n[281 U.S. 610, 618]\n\u00a0\n make regulations to guard against the diversion of alcohol for unlawful purposes and to protect the public revenue; that the power to issue regulations includes the power to repeal and amend them; that section 9, title 2 (27 USCA  21) applies only to the permits required by statute and does not abridge the regulatory power with respect to permits required only by administrative regulation. The conclusion is, in our opinion, unsound.\n Since no question has been raised as to the propriety of plaintiff's permit, we do not inquire whether the permit is required by the act or whether its requirement by regulations is authorized thereby. But, if the requirement of the permit is proper, it is so only because it is authorized by the act, either explicitly or otherwise. There is no suggestion that the regulations were made under any other authority. If, then, the permit was issued under authority of the Prohibition Act, the plaintiff comes within the description in title 2,  9 (27 USCA  21), of 'any person who has a permit'; and that section provides the exclusive procedure for the revocation of the permit. The attempt to revoke it by regulations without complying with that section exceeds the authority, and violates rights, conferred by the Act. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n[281 U.S. 610, 619]\n\u00a0\n We answer the third question in the negative. For reasons stated in connection with questions 2 and 3 in No. 510, we answer the second question in the affirmative; and do not answer the first. \n No. 445\n-Affirmed.\n No. 510-Question 1 answered No.\n Question 2 not answered.\n Question 3 answered Yes.\n Question 4 answered No.\n No. 511-Question 1 not answered.\n Question 2 answered Yes.\n Question 3 answered No. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Completely denatured alcohol is alcohol which has been denatured by a limited number of fixed formulae, for sale to the general public with very little supervision. Specially denatured alcohol is alcohol which is not as completely denatured as the 'completely,' and can only be obtained under a heavy bond for use in manufacturing processes in which the alcohol is always protected by the bond.'-Treasury Dept., Internal Revenue Regulations 61, Jan. 31, 1920 (T. D. 2986), art. 92. 'Specially denatured alcohol is ethyl alcohol so treated with denaturants as to permit its use in a greater number of specialized arts and industries than completely denatured alcohol.' Regulations 61, revised July 1925, art. 88. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] As in Nos. 443 and 444, two permits are required from the plaintiffs in these cases: One, the basic permit conferring general authority to engage in the business; the other, a supplemental permit, issued from time to time, granting authority for specific withdrawals of alcohol or specially denatured alcohol. Only the basic permits are here involved. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The first regulations promulgated under the Prohibition Act, Regulations 61, January 31, 1920, provided that permits to operate denaturing plants and permits to use specially denatured alcohol in manufacture should 'remain in force until voluntarily surrendered or cancelled.'-Articles 97 and 115. These provisions were continued in articles 93 and 111 of Regulations 61, revised July, 1925. These Regulations were superseded by Regulations 3, discussed in the text. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The permit in No. 511 reads: 'For violation of the provisions of Title III of the national,' etc. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The District Court's opinion in No. 510 is reported in 41 F.(2d) 784, under title Swanson Chemical Corp v. Doran. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] If read literally, the first question is irrelevant to a decision and need not be answered. For, calling the solution 'liquor' during its manufacture and preparation for the market-that is, before it is fully denatured and becomes the 'article,' denatured alcohol-does not aid in determining whether or not a permit to operate a denaturing plant and manufacture denatured alcohol is a permit 'to manufacture ... liquor.' The character of the permit is determined, not by the nature of the solution in the process of manufacture, but by the character of the finished article authorized to be produced. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] We are not told what denaturants plaintiffs use; but we are asked to take judicial notice that denatured alcohol may be fitted for beverage purposes by extracting the denaturant. We may also take judicial notice that some denaturants cannot be successfully extracted; and that any denaturant must be 'such that it can not be removed from the mixture and the treated product made fit for beverage purposes without great difficulty.' See 'Industrial Alcohol,' a monograph issued by the Treasury Dept., Bureau of Prohibition, p. 4 (Gov't Ptg. Office, 1930). Moreover, from the standpoint of caution, denatured alcohol, however treated, is not fit for beverage purposes. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Except for the slight variation in the language of the permit mentioned in note 1, supra, and quoted in the third question. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The government urges that under Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16,  IV, N, subsec. 2, 38 Stat. 114, 199, and Act of June 7, 1906, c. 3047, 34 Stat. 217 (U. S. C., tit. 26,  481-187 (26 USCA  481-487)), the requirement of permits for the manufacture and denaturation of alcohol tax free, in special cases, was governed entirely by regulations; that permits under the regulations made pursuant to those acts were limited to specific amounts of alcohol (Regulations 30, arts. 60, 61, 77-90); that sections 10 and 11, title 3 of the act (27 USCA  80, 81), treat of similar subjects; and that the Prohibition Act, as shown by the report of the House Judiciary Committee (H. R. Report No. 91, 66th Cong., 1st sess., p. 2), purports to continue the policy of the prior acts and regulations. There is a decisive difference between the Prohibition Act and those statutes. The former are silent on the whole subject of permits; the latter specifically provides how permits should be revoked. Moreover, the plaintiffs in Nos. 443 and 444, relying on the same and even more specific portions of the House Committee report referring to the Lever Act, August 10, 1918, c. 53,  15 and 16, 40 Stat. 276, 282, the Revenue Act of 1918, February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1105-1116, and Internal Revenue T. D. 2788, make quite as cogent an argument for a contrary conclusion. We need not consider the merits of either argument. For, we are of opinion that title 2,  9 (27 USCA  21), is applicable to the permits involved in all these cases. There is no need to seek light from debatable inferences from a general statement in the Committee report.\n The government also points out that, aside from the decisions in Nos. 443, 444, 445, and 510, its contentions in No. 511 are of great importance to the administrative officers in promulgating regulations governing the use of specially denatured alcohol. Our decision merely denies the power to revoke unexpired permits in a way other than that prescribed in the act. As in Nos. 443 and 445, we refrain from deciding whether or not the regulations are effective as to future applicants for permits. \n\n\n\n\n","18":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCARLEY & HAMILTON v. SNOOK(1930)\nNo. 267\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1930\n\n\n\nIn No. 86: \n\n[281 U.S. 66, 67]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edwin C. Ewing, of Seattle, Wash., and W. R. Crawford, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellants.\n Messrs. U. S. Webb and William F. Cleary, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees.\nIn No. 267:\n Messrs. W. R. Crawford, of San Francisco, Cal., and Henry G. Hotchkiss, of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 66, 68]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are appeals under section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380), from final decrees of District Courts of three judges for the Northern District of California. Each, on motion to dismiss the complaint, dissolved a temporary injunction, dismissed the complaint, and upheld the constitutionality of section 77(b) and (c) of the Motor Vehicle Act of California, 1923 California Statutes, c. 266, as amended, 1927 California Statutes, c. 844. Section 36(a) requires every motor vehicle operated upon the public highways of the state to be registered. Under section 77(a) an annual fee of $3 is exacted for the registration of all motor vehicles. By subsections (b) and (c), printed in the margin so far as relevant,1 a graduated license or registration fee, payable \n\n[281 U.S. 66, 69]\n\u00a0\n in advance, is exacted for registration of motor vehicles used for transportation 'of passengers for hire or for transportation of property.' The duty of enforcing the act is committed to the respondent, the chief of the division of motor vehicles, who is required to deposit the fees collected in the state treasury to the credit of the 'motor vehicle fund.' After deductions for the support of the division of motor vehicles, the fund is required to be expended, one half by paying it over to the counties, to be used by them in the construction and maintenance of public roads, the other half for the maintenance of state roads.\n Under sections 51, 153(c), operation of a motor vehicle for which the registration fees have not been paid is a \n\n[281 U.S. 66, 70]\n\u00a0\n misdemeanor, punishable by fine of not more than $500, or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. By section 81, fees not paid for 30 days after they become due are doubled. Their payment is secured by a lien upon the vehicles required to be registered, enforceable by seizure and sale.\n Incorporated cities in California may enact ordinances requiring license fees for the operation of motor vehicles used in transporting passengers for hire, and property, within city limits. Constitution of California, art. 11,  11, 12; section 145, Motor Vehicle Act. It is conceded that all California cities have passed ordinances imposing such registration fees, varying from $5 to $42 per motor vehicle, in addition to those scheduled in section 77, and that 75 per cent. of the fees collected under these ordinances are applied to the maintenance of streets in cities.\n The petitioners in both suits are owners of motor vehicles of various types, described in section 77(b) or (c), which petitioners in No. 86 operate exclusively over highways within the limits of incorporated cities, and which petitioners in No. 267 operate over highways principally within but partly without city limits. Both complaints assail the validity of the act under the Constitution of California and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The bill in No. 86 was filed December 29, 1928. Its allegations, admitted by the motion to dismiss, are that the petitioners will be required to pay license fees for the ensuing year on or before January 31, 1929, in order to use their motor vehicles upon streets of incorporated cities, and to avoid the destruction of their business and irreparable loss by the seizure and sale of their motor vehicles and the imposition of the penalties of the act, which respondent threatens to enforce. See Packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140\n, 44 S. Ct. 257.\n Petitioners insist that the registration fees imposed by section 77(b) and (c) are in effect tolls for the use of the high \n\n[281 U.S. 66, 71]\n\u00a0\n ways maintained by the state, see Matter of Schuler, 167 Cal. 282, 290, 139 P. 685, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 706; Bacon Service Corp. v. Huss, 199 Cal. 21, 29, 248 P. 235, and as they pay the license tax imposed by the cities for the use of city streets, the exaction of the additional 'tolls' with respect to highways outside of cities, which petitioners in No. 86 do not use and which the petitioners in No. 267 use less than the city streets, is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n This argument is based upon cases in this court arising, not under the Fourteenth Amendment, but the commerce clause of the Constitution, where the tax assailed was levied by a state on interstate carriers and purported to be exacted for their use of the state highways. In such cases this court must ascertain whether a forbidden burden is imposed on interstate commerce. For that purpose it may inquire whether the tax bears some reasonable relation to the use of the state facilities by the carrier. Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163\n, 48 S. Ct. 502, 62 A. L. R. 45; Interstate Busses Corporation v. Blodgett, \n276 \nU.S. 245, 246\n, 48 S. Ct. 230; Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 619\n, 35 S. Ct. 140; Kane v. State of New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160\n, 37 S. Ct. 30; Clark v. Poor, \n274 \nU.S. 554\n, 47 S. Ct. 702\n\n\n But we are now concerned only with the use of motor cars in intrastate commerce, and in any case, not the precise name which may be given to the money payment demanded, but its effect upon the persons paying it, is of importance in determining whether the Constitution is infringed. Whatever other descriptive term may be applied to the present registration fees, they are exactions, made in the exercise of the state taxing power, for the privilege of operating specified classes of motor vehicles over public highways, and expended for state purposes. Such fees, if covered into the state treasury and used for public purposes, as are general taxes, obviously would not offend against the due process clause. Nor can we see that they do so the more because the state has designated the particular public purposes for \n\n[281 U.S. 66, 72]\n\u00a0\n which they may be used. There is nothing in the Federal Constitution which requires a state to apply such fees for the benefit of those who pay them. See Thomas v. Gay, \n169 \nU.S. 264, 280\n, 18 S. Ct. 340.\n A corollary of this contention is that although the fees are not per se disproportionate to the privilege of operating over all the highways of the state, petitioners are nevertheless entitled to receive licenses limiting the operation of their motorcars to the few highways which they wish to use, upon payment of correspondingly reduced fees. But no constitutional principle is suggested, and we know of none, which would enable a licensee thus to regulate the extent of the privilege granted or to assail an otherwise valid tax upon it merely because a reduction of the privilege and the tax would better suit his convenience or his pocketbook.\n The objection that the petitioners should not be required to pay the challenged fees because they are already paying the city license tax is but the familiar one, often rejected, that a state may not, by different statutes, impose two taxes upon the same subject-matter, although, concededly, the total tax, if imposed by a single taxing statute, would not transgress the due process clause. See Swiss Corporation v. Shanks, \n273 \nU.S. 407, 413\n, 47 S. Ct. 393; St. Louis, Southwestern Ry. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 367\n, 368 S., 35 S. Ct. 99; Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 58\n, 40 S. Ct. 221; Ft. Smith Lumber Co. v. Arkansas, \n251 \nU.S. 532, 533\n, 40 S. Ct. 304.\n Only a word need be said of petitioner's contention that the exemption of all vehicles weighing less than 3,000 pounds, although their loaded weight may be much more than vehicles not exempt, infringes the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the similar section 21 of article 1 of the State Constitution. \n2\n That the Legislature \n\n[281 U.S. 66, 73]\n\u00a0\n may graduate the fees according to the propensities of the vehicles to injure or to destroy the public highways, and may exempt those with respect to which this tendency is slight or nonexistent, cannot be doubted. We may not assume that vehicles weighing less than 3,000 pounds, with loads which they usually carry, are not of this class, or that vehicles weighing more than 3,000 pounds with their accustomed burden added do not have this tendency. It is for the Legislature to draw the line between the two classes. Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 300\n, 301 S., 18 S. Ct. 594; Clark v. Titusville, \n184 \nU.S. 329, 331\n, 22 S. Ct. 382; Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59, 62\n, 32 S. Ct. 192; Citizens' Telephone Co. v. Fuller, \n229 \nU.S. 322\n, 33 S. Ct. 837; Watson v.

Fifth Avenue Coach Co. v. New York, \n221 \nU.S. 467, 484\n, 31 S. Ct. 709; Packard v. Banton, supra; Silver v. Silver, \n280 \nU.S. 117, 123\n, 50 S. Ct. 57.\n These conclusions are decisive of the like questions raised in No. 267. An additional objection raised in that suit is that the registration fees under section 77 are 'tolls' prohibited by the Federal Highway Act, 42 Stat. 212 (23 USCA  1-25), under which the state has received grants of federal aid for the construction and reconstruction of highways. Section 9 of the Federal Highway Act (23 USCA  9) provides 'that all highways constructed or reconstructed under the provisions of this Act shall be free from tolls of all kinds.'\n The present registration fees cannot be said to be tolls in the commonly accepted sense of a proprietor's charge for the passage over a highway or bridge, exacted when and as the privilege of passage is exercised. See Huse v. Glover, \n119 \nU.S. 543, 548\n, 7 S. Ct. 313; Sands v. Manistee River Imp. Co., \n123 \nU.S. 288, 293\n, 8 S. Ct. 113; St. Louis v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n148 \nU.S. 92, 97\n, 13 S. Ct. 485. The fact that registration fees are imposed generally upon all residents who use motor vehicles within the state, without reference to any \n\n[281 U.S. 66, 74]\n\u00a0\n particular highways or to the extent or frequency of the use, and that, as in California, they are not exacted of nonresident automobilists passing through the state (1923 California Statutes, c. 266,  47), marks them as demands of sovereignty, not of proprietorship, and likens them to taxes rather than tolls. The fact that they may have been held justified, in other connections, because of their similarity to 'tolls for the use of highways,' affords no basis for saying that the present fees are prohibited tolls within the meaning of the Federal Highway Act.\n Such fees were a common form of state license tax before the Federal Highway Act was adopted in 1921. That act contemplated the continued maintenance by the states of state highways, constructed with federal aid, the expense of which must necessarily be defrayed from revenues derived from state taxation. It cannot be supposed that Congress intended to procure the abandonment by the states of this well-recognized type of taxation without more explicit language than that prohibiting tolls found in section 9 (23 USCA  9). Judgments in both cases.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 77. Registration fees.

The state court denied recovery on the ground that the tax is imposed only on the oil and gas when severed from the land, and so is a tax upon personalty not embraced within the exemption. 134 Okl. 35, 272 P. 393.\n In Choate v. Trapp, \n224 \nU.S. 665\n, 32 S. Ct. 565, the history of the Atoka Agreement was reviewed by this court. It was there held that the provision for the exemption conferred, upon the allottees, property rights which were within \n\n[280 U.S. 363, 366]\n\u00a0\n the protection of the Fifth Amendment, and hence it was not subject to repeal by later Congressional legislation; that the restriction, being one imposed in the exercise of the plenary power of Congress over the Indian tribes and tribal lands and in the performance of its duty as the guardian of its Indian wards, see Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, \n187 \nU.S. 553, 565\n, 23 S. Ct. 216, and having been accepted by the state of Oklahoma in its constitution upon admission to statehood, was a limitation upon the taxing power of the state. See, also, Ward v. Board of Com'rs of Love County, \n253 \nU.S. 17\n, 40 S. Ct. 419.\n Until the removal by the act of May 27, 1908, of existing restrictions on alienation of the allotted lands, state taxation even more remotely affecting the interests of allottees than the present tax would concededly have been forbidden as a tax upon an instrumentality of the national government. See Choctaw, O. & Gulf R. R. v. Harrison, \n235 \nU.S. 292\n, 35 S. Ct. 27; Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, \n271 \nU.S. 609\n, 46 S. Ct. 592; Gillespie v. Oklahoma, \n257 \nU.S. 501\n, 42 S. Ct. 171; Howard v. Gipsy Oil Company, \n247 \nU.S. 503\n, 38 S. Ct. 426; Large Oil Company v. Howard, \n248 \nU.S. 549\n, 39 S. Ct. 183. But it is urged that, as the restrictions have now been removed, Congress, by its attempted repeal of the exemption and by later legislation of May 10, 1928 (45 Stat. 496), subjecting oil and gas, produced from restricted allotted lands of members of the five civilized tribes, to state and federal taxes, has evidenced an intention to subject the Indians to all taxes imposed upon citizens of Oklahoma. From this it is concluded that the exemption in section 29 must be narrowly construed to effect the Congressional purpose. See Shaw v. Gibson- Zahniser Oil Corp., \n276 \nU.S. 575\n, 46 S. Ct. 333.\n While in general tax exemptions are not to be presumed and statutes conferring them are to be strictly construed, Heiner v. Colonial Tr. Co., \n275 \nU.S. 232\n, 48 S. Ct. 65, the contrary is the rule to be applied to tax exemptions secured to the Indians by agreement between them and the national government. Choate v. Trapp, supra, page 675 of 224 U. S., 32 S. Ct. 565. \n\n[280 U.S. 363, 367]\n\u00a0\n Such provisions are to be liberally construed. Doubtful expressions are to be resolved in favor of the weak and defenseless people who are the wards of the nation, dependent upon its protection and good faith. Hence, in the words of Chief Justice Marshall: 'The language used in treaties with the Indians should never be construed to their prejudice. If words be made use of, which are susceptible of a more extended meaning than their plain import, as connected with the tenor of the treaty, they should be considered as used only in the latter sense.' Worcester v. The State of Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 582. See the Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737. And they must be construed, not according to their technical meaning, but 'in the sense in which they would naturally be understood by the Indians.' Jones v. Meehan, \n175 U.S. 1\n, 11 20 S. Ct. 1.\n Whatever was the meaning of the present exemption clause at the time of its adoption must be taken to be its effect now, since it may not be narrowed by any subsequently declared intention of Congress. Choate v. Trapp, supra. Having in mind the obvious purpose of the Atoka Agreement to protect the Indians from the burden of taxation with respect to their allotments and this applicable principle of construction, we think the provision that 'the lands allotted shall be non-taxable while the title remains in the allottees' cannot be taken to be restricted only to those taxes commonly known as land or real estate taxes, but must be deemed at least to embrace a tax assessed against the allottees with respect to a legal interest in their allotment less than the whole, acquired or retained by them by virtue of their ownership.\n Where a federal right is concerned we are not bound by the characterization given to a state tax by state courts or Legislatures, or relieved by it from the duty of considering the real nature of the tax and its effect upon \n\n[280 U.S. 363, 368]\n\u00a0\n the federal right asserted. Choctaw, O. & Gulf R. R. v. Harrison, supra; Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Ry. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 227\n, 28 S. Ct. 638. We think it plain that the tax imposed on the royalty interest of the present petitioners is not a tax on oil and gas severed from the realty, but is, by its very terms, a tax upon the right reserved in them as lessors and owners of the fee. The tax is imposed on the 'royalty interest ... except such interests of the State of Oklahoma or such royalty interests as are exempted from taxation under the laws of the United States' and is made 'a lien on such interest.' It is in lieu of all other taxes 'upon any property rights attached to or inherent in the right' to the specified minerals and 'upon the mining rights and privileges for the minerals aforesaid belonging to or appertaining to the land.'\n It sufficiently appears, were that controlling, that numerous decisions of the Oklahoma courts since the Atoka Agreement have treated the royalty interest of the lessor as a right attached and incident to his ownership or reversionary interest in the land.

But even if this did not appear to be the case, an interest commonly so regarded and practically so associated with the use and enjoyment of the allotted lands cold not, under the rule of liberal construction rightly invoked by the petitioners, be deemed excluded from the benefits of the exemption granted by section 29.

Compare Pollock v. Farmers Loan & Tr. Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429\n, 15 S. Ct. 673.\n The Supreme Court of Oklahoma also rested its denial to petitioners of the right to recover the 1926 tax upon the ground that, having failed to pay the tax for the year when due, they were barred by the provisions of sections 9971 and 9973 of the Compiled Oklahoma Statutes for 1921. Under these sections, relief by injunction against the collection of any tax is forbidden and a suit to recover a tax alleged to be illegally assessed is allowed only if paid 'at the time and in the manner provided by law.' But the petitioners' allegations, admitted on demurrer, are that the tax was paid under duress and compulsion to prevent the issue of respondent's warrant for its collection, to prevent the stopping by respondent of further royalty payments to them, and to prevent the accumulation of statutory penalties. These allegations are sufficient to bring the case within the ruling of this court in Ward v. Board of Com'rs of Love County, supra, that a denial by a state court of a recovery of taxes exacted in violation of the laws or Constitution of the United States by compulsion is itself in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The judgment below will be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHARTER SHIPPING CO. v.

Bailey, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, a British corporation, filed in the District Court for Southern New York a libel in personam against petitioner, also a British corporation, to recover a general average deposit made in London. The libel alleged that the petitioner received on its vessel, the Charterhague, at various Gulf and Atlantic ports in the United States, shipments of rosin and turpentine for transportation to London, bills of lading for which were indorsed to the respondent. As grounds for recovery it was set up that the general average act was due to unseaworthiness of the vessel at the beginning of the voyage, unknown to respondent when it made the deposit in order to release the cargo from the general average lien.\n On the libel, the general appearance and exceptions of the libelee, the petitioner here, and an answering affidavit setting up that after the libel in the present suit was filed respondent commenced suit in England involving the same subject-matter, the District Court dismissed the libel, saying that contribution for general average is to \n\n[281 U.S. 515, 517]\n\u00a0\n be determined by law of the port of discharge and that 'under all the circumstances' jurisdiction should be declined. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the jurisdiction should have been retained. 33 F.( 2d) 280. It pointed out that the suit did not involve a restatement of a general average adjustment and said that if the bills of lading contained a 'Jason clause' or incorporated the provisions of the Harter Act (46 USCA  190-195), the question of due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy would be an issue in the case, citing The Jason, \n225 \nU.S. 32\n, 32 S.

C.) 88 F. 528; that the rule that general average is controlled by the law at the port of destination was consequently an insufficient reason for declining jurisdiction, and, in view of the statement of the affidavit that there were American witnesses as to seaworthiness, concluded that it was expedient under all the circumstances for the court to retain jurisdiction. This court granted certiorari, \n280 \nU.S. 545\n, 50 S. Ct. 39, 74 L. Ed. -.\n The retention of jurisdiction of a suit in admiralty between foreigners is within the discretion of the District Court. The exercise of its discretion may not be disturbed unless abused. The Belgenland, \n114 \nU.S. 355, 368\n, 5 S. Ct. 860; The Maggie Hammond, 9 Wall. 435, 457.\n The affidavit states that the bills of lading contain a clause providing for general average, but the bills of lading are not in the record and it does not appear that they embraced Jason or other clauses modifying the liability in general average. As that liability arises not from contract but from participation in the common venture, see Hobson v. Lord, \n92 U.S. 397\n; Barnard v. Adams, 10 How. 270, 303; The Roanoke (C. C. A.) 59 F. 161, 163; Milburn v. Jamaica Fruit, etc., Co., (1900) 2 Q. B. 540, 550, its extent \n\n[281 U.S. 515, 518]\n\u00a0\n in the absence of such limiting clauses is, under the admiralty rule, fixed by the law of the port of destination. Hobson v.

Even if so limited, the extent and effect of the limitation cannot be determined apart from consideration of the rule limited.\n Both the parties being British subjects and the present litigation, as well as the suit pending abroad, apparently involving the application of English law to the fund located there, it was for the Distirct Court to say, as it did, upon a consideration of all the circumstances, whether it should decline 'to take cognizance of the case if justice would be done as well by remitting the parties to the home forum.' See The Maggie Hammond, supra, page 457 of 9 Wall..\n Even if we assume, as did the court below, that the bills of lading may have modified the liability in general average so as to put in issue the care taken to make the vessel seaworthy before sailing, we cannot say that the District Court improvidently exercised its discretion. While some witnesses as to seaworthiness were 'American repairmen,' it does not appear that any were in or near the southern district of New York. The libel alleges that the Charterhague plied as a common carrier between American ports and London where, so far as appears, her officers and crew would be available as witnesses as to the alleged unseaworthy condition of engines and boilers. It was for the District Judge to consider the facts appearing and the inferences which he might draw from them and reach his own conclusion as to the convenience of witnesses as well as the other factors upon which he decided that justice would be best served by leaving the parties to their suit in England.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHESAPEAKE & O R.

UNITED STATES(1930)\nNo. 389\nArgued: Decided: May 5, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 385, 386]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Stanton C. Peelle and C. F. R. Ogilby, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Seth W. Richardson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit under the Dent Act, March 2, 1919, c. 94, 40 Stat. 1272 (50 USCA  80 note), to recover upon a contract said to be implied in fact, to pay the cost of installing a very large telephone switchboard for the War Department during the late war, less the amounts realized from the parts when the switchboard was removed. The Court of Claims dismissed the petition, and a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court.\n The decision of the Court of Claims went upon the ground that the installation was covered by a written contract between the plaintiff and the Secretary of the Treasury (Act of June 17, 1910, c. 297, 36 Stat. 468, 531,  4, U. S. Code, tit. 41,  7 (41 USCA  7)), and that there was no subsequent contract enlarging the obligation of the Government; it being expressly found that the only persons to whom any suggestion was made that additional pay was expected had no authority to bind the Government, Jacob Reed's Sons v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 200, 202\n, 47 S. Ct. 339; Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 592, 596\n, 43 S. Ct. 425, and that the Secretary of War never heard the suggestion or knew that a claim would be made until after the \n\n[281 U.S. 385, 387]\n\u00a0\n armistice. We are of opinion that on the findings the decision was right.\n The contract in force when the work was completed, June 22, 1918, bound the Telephone Company to 'install, equip, and maintain such telephone equipment as may be required in the District of Columbia, and furnish service in connection therewith' at rates set forth, one item being 'common battery private branch exchange switchboards, including one operator's set of telephones for each operator's position, each, per annum , $24.00.' Although it is argued that neither the Act of June 17, 1910, c. 297, nor the contract covered this unusually large switchboard, we think it too plain for discussion that the words used, taken literally, covered it in terms. The only suggestion that needs a short answer is that this work was so wholly outside anything that was contemplated that a special agreement was necessary or at least just. But war had been approaching and large additions had been made without question until after war was declared, April 6, 1917. A little later the present structure was placed in a separate building erected for it by the United States. The understanding of the parties is shown by the fact that a contract with similar terms was made for the next year on September 25, 1918. The plaintiff sent in and was paid bills for rental at the old rate, for increased rates for the lines and stations, and other unquestioned bills, without any attempt to charge for the expenses of the new structure. The explanation of the slight charges for rentals is simple and makes the whole business clear. The settled policy of the Company was to rely for its chief revenue on mileage charges upon station lines, charges for telephone stations, and local messages. Had the war gone on another year probably it would have made a good deal of money. The American Telegraph and Telephone Company regarded the problem of increased telephone service at the War Department as largely its own, and in fact \n\n[281 U.S. 385, 388]\n\u00a0\n has more than reimbursed the plaintiff for its loss. When the plaintiff's district manager told his superior officer that the installation ought to be held up until they got a written order, he was told that they wanted to do everything possible for the Government and would take their chances of getting paid.\n There is nothing upon which the Company can found a claim except that in January, 1918, it advised the person who was in charge of the telephone service of the War Department, but whose salary the plaintiff paid, and another under whose general direction the service was, that it expected the Government to pay the cost of the new switchboard, less salvage. There was no assent to this expectation, nor did these officers have any authority to give such assent, and as we have said there was neither assent nor knowledge on the part of those higher up. The fact that plans of the building to be erected by the Government showing the switchboard and equipment proposed were submitted to the Secretary of War is no help to the plaintiff. Of course they were, whichever was to pay the bills. Neither was the continued use of the structure after the plaintiff had made its claims. The Government had to use it, and had the right to use it, whether the Government was bound to pay, or whether, as the plaintiff's engineer said to its district manager, the Telephone Company took the chances of getting paid. The Government had the plaintiff's contract and would have had the right to rely upon it even if it had been informed that the plaintiff was dissatisfied. It seems to us that the dissent of two of the Judges of the Court below is directed rather to the findings than to the statement of the law upon the findings as they stand. These are not open to question before us.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO & N.

Co.\n Mr. F. De Journel, of Fresno, Cal., for Lindell.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n October 17, 1925, appellee delivered to the railroad of the Southern Pacific Company at Kingsburg, Cal., a shipment of grapes for transportation to Chicago for \n\n[281 U.S. 14, 15]\n\u00a0\n delivery to a named consignee. The appellant received the car at Omaha, hauled it to Chicago, and there delivered it to the consignee without collecting the freight and other charges, which amounted to $683.79. Because of unreasonable delay on the part of appellant and its failure to use reasonable care to keep the car properly iced, the grapes were delivered in a damaged condition. Appellant sued in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California to recover such charges; and appellee by answer set up the loss. While claiming to have suffered damages of $1,011.70, he asked no affirmative relief, but only that the loss be held to be a set-off against appellant's claim. The court allowed the set-off.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, under section 239 of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C.,  346 (28 USCA  346) certified to this court the following question:\n'Where an interstate railroad carrier delivers to the consignee at destination a consignment of freight without collecting the transportation and other lawful charges and thereafter brings an action at law to recover from the shipper the amount thereof, in a United States court in a district where the state law provides that if a defendant omits to set up a counterclaim arising out of the transaction constituting the foundation of the plaintiff's claim he cannot thereafter maintain an action upon the same, and, further, that where such cross-claims have existed 'the two demands shall be deemed compensated,' is the shipper, acting in good faith and without collusion, debarred by the Interstate Commerce Acts, particularly the Hepburn Act (34 Stat. 587) from pleading, by way of set-off, a counterclaim for a loss suffered by him as a result of the carrier's failure to perform its obligations touching the transportation and delivery of the identical shipment?'1 \n\n[281 U.S. 14, 16]\n\u00a0\n The appellant is liable to the appellee for damages in an amount at least equal to the charges sued for. 49 U. S. C.  20(11), 49 USCA  20(11 ). And, unless the Hepburn Act stands in the way, the shipper has the right, under established practice in California, to set up his loss as a counterclaim. 28 U. S. C.  724 (28 USCA  724); California Code of Civil Procedure,  437, 438, 439, 440; Payne v. Clarke (D. C.) 271 F. 525.\n\n The provision follows: '... Nor shall any carrier charge or demand or collect or receive a greater or less or different compensation for such transportation of passengers or property, or for any service in connection therewith, ... than the rates, fares and charges which are specified in the tariff ...; nor shall any carrier refund or remit in any manner or by any device any portion of the rates, fares, and charges so specified, nor extend to any shipper or person any privileges or facilities in the transportation of passengers or property, except such as are specified in such tariffs.' 49 U. S. C.  6(7), 49 USCA  6(7).\n The purpose of the act to prevent discrimination has been emphasized by this court, and is well known. Since \n\n[281 U.S. 14, 17]\n\u00a0\n its enactment, carriers may not accept services, advertising, property, or a release of claim for damages in payment for transportation. They are required to collect the established rates, charges, and fares from all alike in cash. Louisville & Nashville R. R. v. Mottley, \n219 \nU.S. 467\n, 31 S. Ct. 265, 34 L. R. A. (N.

S.) 657.\n The adjustment of defendant's demand by counterclaim in plaintiff's action rather than by independent suit is favored and encourage by the law. That practice serves to avoid circuity of action, inconvenience, expense, consumption of the courts' time, and injustice. North Chicago Rolling Mill Co. v. Ore & Steel Co., \n152 \nU.S. 596, 615\n, 616 S., 14 S. Ct. 710; Florida Railroad Co. v. Smith, 21 Wall. 255, 261; Partridge v. Insurance Co., 15 Wall. 573, 579. In the case last mentioned the court, speaking through Mr. Justice Miller, said (page 580 of 15 Wall.): 'It would be a most pernicious doctrine to allow a citizen of a distant State to institute in these courts a suit against a citizen of the State where the court is held and escape the liability which the laws of the State have attached to all plaintiffs of allowing just and legal set-offs and counter claims to be interposed and tried in the same suit and in the same form.'\n The practice of determining claims of shippers for loss or damage in suits brought by carriers to collect transportation charges is not repugnant to the rule prohibiting the payment of such charges otherwise than in money. The adjudication in one suit of the respective claims of plaintiff and defendant is the practical equivalent of charging a judgment obtained in one action against that secured in another. Neither is to be distinguished from payment in money. \n\n[281 U.S. 14, 18]\n\u00a0\n It is well understood that payment by carriers to shippers under the guise of settling claims for loss and damage may in effect constitute discrimination that the act was intended to prevent. But it is not suggested how opportunity for collusion in respect of such matters would be lessened by abolishing counterclaims in cases such as this. Collusion and fraud may be practiced in the defense and settlement of separate actions brought on such claims, as well as when the same matters are put forward as offsets or counterclaims.\n The act ought not to be construed to put aside state laws and long- established practice in respect of pleading unless the intention of Congress so to do is plain. There appears no reasonable probability that the relegation of shippers to separate actions for the enforcement of their claims for loss or damage would operate more effectively to enforce the purpose of Congress to prevent discrimination.

Neely, both of Omaha, Neb., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. O. S. Spillman, of Norfolk, Neb., and Hugh La Master, of Lincoln, Neb., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on writ of error, allowed under section 237, Jud. Code (28 USCA  344), before the amendment of January 31, 1928 (28 USCA  861a), to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nebraska, which sustained an order of the State Railway Commission. 115 Neb. 727, 214 N. W. 746. The order directed plaintiff in error to install, at an estimated cost of $1,153 to it and of $453 to the landowner, an underground cattle pass under its tracks, so as to connect the farm lands of defendant in error lying on either side of and adjacent to plaintiff's right of way. The Commission acted under authority purporting to be given by section 5527, Comp. Stat. Neb. 1922, as amended (Laws of Neb. 1923, c. 167), printed in the \n\n[282 U.S. 162, 164]\n\u00a0\n margin. \n1\n The plaintiff assails the statute, as applied in this instance, as depriving it of property without due process of law (Amendment 14) and as impairing the obligation of contract (article 1,  10) in violation of the Federal Constitution.\n Defendant's farm comprises a quarter section of land, divided approximately in half by plaintiff's track, which crosses from the northwest corner to the southeast. For fifteen or more years plaintiff has maintained a farm crossing at grade, now equipped with gates, which connects the parts of the farm near its northwest corner. The state court assumed that the crossing was established before 1921 and while the statute (Rev. St. Neb. 1913,  6042) provided only that, where the same person owns land on both sides of a railroad, the latter 'shall, when required so to do, make and keep in good repair one causeway or other adequate means of crossing the same.' Amendments (Laws of Neb. 1921, c. 261, and that of 1923) added the provisions authorizing the commission to entertain complaint by the landowner that a crossing 'is not adequate or is unsafe and dangerous to the life and property of \n\n[282 U.S. 162, 165]\n\u00a0\n those who use' it, and to require an overhead or underground crossing 'if circumstances warrant.'\n The proceeding now under review was begun in 1924 by defendant's petition to the commission, setting up, as the sole basis for the order sought, that the surface crossing was inadequate. The only ground of inadequacy alleged or sought to be proved was that the crossing could not be reached without passing through defendant's cultivated fields on both sides of the track, to avoid which, defendant was compelled, in transferring his cattle from water supply to pasture and return, to drive them back and forth a distance of three-fourths of a mile on a public highway which crosses plaintiff's line at grade. The petition stated that an underground pass could easily be established at another point on plaintiff's line, where there was a depression on each side, so as to connect defendant's pasture with the southwest part of his farm, and with a cattle runway extending to his yards and water supply.\n The commission, after a hearing, found the facts as alleged, and others showing that defendant's farm could be more conveniently operated if the proposed pass were established, concluded that the present crossing was 'inadequate and impracticable,' and granted the order asked. The commission did not find, nor was there evidence before it tending to show, that the crossing was not adequate for the passing and repassing of such persons and cattle as would normally go from one part of defendant's farm to the other in conducting usual farm operations.\n The state court, in passing on the order, had before it only the evienc e given and proceedings had before the commission. Saying that the record did not adequately present the point, it assumed, upon the basis of concessions stated to be in briefs before it, that plaintiff ac- \n\n[282 U.S. 162, 166]\n\u00a0\n quired its right of way by condemnation prior to 1921. It pointed out that at that time the statute required plaintiff to maintain a causeway or 'other adequate means of crossing' between the two parts of the farm. It said that compensation for the land condemned must be taken to have been assessed in view of the provisions of the statute, and that plaintiff took its right of way subject to the statutory obligation to construct and maintain the 'adequate' farm crossing defined by the statute. It mooted, without deciding, the question whether the present crossing was adequate within the meaning of the statute as originally enacted, suggested that there might be 'a further definition' of adequacy 'by the state in proper exercise of its police power,' and supported the order of the commission on the ground that the state could, in the exercise of its police power, 'eliminate the perils of grade crossings.'\n There is no occasion for us to consider how far, if at all, the state's power to remove the dangers of public grade crossings (see Erie Railroad Co. v. Board of Public Utility Commissioners, \n254 \nU.S. 394\n, 41 S. Ct. 169) extends to private farm crossings when unsafe to the traveling public or individual users. The Nebraska statute has delegated to the State Railway Commission authority to order farm crossings underground because either inadequate or dangerous, if circumstances warrant. But there is nothing in this record to suggest that the order of the commission was either asked or granted as a safety measure. The commission did not find that the crossing was dangerous either to the public, the litigants, or their property. Neither did it find that this crossing was in anywise different from the usual farm crossing at grade. True, there was testimony that cattle passing over the crossing \n\n[282 U.S. 162, 167]\n\u00a0\n needed to be attended and controlled to prevent injury to them by trains. But this was no more true of that crossing than of surface farm crossings in general. The case is one of a single track branch line. The track is straight, and it was conceded on argument before this court that there were only four trains a day. While there are bare assertions in the testimony that the private crossing was dangerous, there was no evidence of any danger beyond that which would attend the use of any farm crossing. Neither the commission nor the state court regarded the statute as condemning all such crossings, doubtless because the statute distinctly includes that type of crossing among those which it authorizes the commission to require; its words being, 'the commission may require overhead, underground or grade crossings' as the circumstances may warrant. It is plain that the commission proceeded upon the assumption that the statute authorized it to compel plaintiff to establish the underground pass for the convenience and benefit of defendant in the use of his own property, and that that alone was the ground and purpose of the order. The application thus given to the statute deprives plaintiff of property for the private use and benefit of defendant, and is a taking of property without due process of law, forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.

VESTER(1930)\nNo. 372\nArgued: Decided: May 19, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 439, 440]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John D. Ellis and Ed. F. Alexander, both of Cincinnati, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Mr. John Weld Peck, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These three cases were heard together. The suits were brought by owners of land in the city of Cincinnati to restrain the appropriation of their property by the city, upon the grounds that the taking was not in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Constitution and statutes of Ohio and would constitute a deprivation of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, it being alleged that the appropriation was not for a public use. Under the law of Ohio these questions could be raised only by injunction proceedings. Pittsburgh, C. C . & St. L. Railway Co. v. Greenville, 69 Ohio St. 487, 496, 69 N. E. 976; Sargent v. Cincinnati, 110 Ohio St. 444, 144 N. E. 132. Decrees in favor of plaintiffs for a permanent injunction \n\n[281 U.S. 439, 441]\n\u00a0\n were entered in the District Court and were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 33 F.(2d) 242. This Court granted writs of certiorari, \n280 \nU.S. 545\n, 50 S. Ct. 38, 74 L. Ed. -.\n The immediate purpose of the city of Cincinnati in the condemnation proceedings was the widening of Fifth street, one of the principal thoroughfares of the city. A resolution of the city council, passed July 6, 1927, declared its intention to appropriate for this purpose a strip of land 25 feet in width, adjacent to the south side of Fifth street, and no question is raised as to the validity of the appropriation of this strip.\n The controversy relates to what is known as 'excess condemnation,' that is, the taking of more land than is needed to be occupied by the improvement directly in contemplation. The Constitution of Ohio provides ( article 18,  10):\n'A municipality appropriating or otherwise acquiring property for public use may in furtherance of such public use appropriate or acquire an excess over that actually to be occupied by the improvement, and may sell such excess with such restrictions as shall be appropriate to preserve the improvement made. Bonds may be issued to supply the funds in whole or in part to pay for the excess property so appropriated or otherwise acquired, but said bonds shall be a lien only against the property so acquired for the improvement and excess, and they shall not be a liability of the municipality nor be included in any limitation of the bonded indebtedness of such municipality prescribed by law.'\n\n In this instance, the city proposes to appropriate property in excess of that actually to be occupied by the widened street, and this excess condemnation embraces the following properties of the plaintiffs:\n The Vester property. This is a lot, with a three-story brick residence, on Broadway, a street intersecting Fifth street. The lot is 27 feet wide by 90 feet deep running \n\n[281 U.S. 439, 442]\n\u00a0\n parallel to Fifth street. It lies 44 feet south of Fifth street, and is thus 19 feet south of the 25-foot strip taken for the street widening. No part of this property is taken for the 25-foot strip or abuts on the widened street, and the entire lot is sought to be appropriated in the proceeding for excess condemnation. Between the Vester property and the 25- foot strip is the lot of another owner.\n The Richards property. This is a leasehold of an improved lot 23 feet wide running from Fifth street 100 feet through to Buchanan street, which is parallel to Fifth street on the South. It is held by the plaintiffs, Richards, with privilege of purchase. The north 25 feet of this lot is taken as a part of the strip for the widened street, and the remaining 75 feet to Buchanan street is sought to be taken in excess condemnation.\n The Reakirt property. This is a tract at the corner of Fifth street and Sycamore street (an intersecting street), 138 feet on the south side of Fifth street and 149 feet on the west side of Sycamore street. The tract, which is vacant except for a small gasoline filling station, embraces several lots, two of which are not contiguous to the 25-foot strip.\n Among the statutory provisions of Ohio relating to the condemnation of property by municipal corporations is the following with respect to the declaration of the purpose of the appropriation (General Code of Ohio,  3679):\n'Sec. 3679. Resolution shall be Passed.-When it is deemed necessary to appropriate property, council shall pass a resolution, declaring such intent defining the purpose of the appropriation, setting forth a pertinent description of the land, and the estate or interest therein desired to be appropriated. For water works purposes and for the purpose of creating reservoirs to provide for a \n\n[281 U.S. 439, 443]\n\u00a0\n supply of water, the council may appropriate such property as it may determine to be necessary.'\n\n The excess condemnation of the properties in question is proposed by the resolution adopted by the city council, but the purpose of the appropriation is stated in the resolution only in the most general terms as being 'in furtherance of the said widening of Fifth Street' and 'necessary for the complete enjoyment and preservation of said public use.' The ordinance providing for the excess appropriation was not more specific, declaring simply that it is 'in furtherance of the public use,' described as the widening of Fifth street, and 'for the more complete enjoyment and preservation of the benefits to accrue from said public use.' In what way the excess condemnation of these properties was in furtherance of the widening of the street, and why it was necessary for the complete enjoyment and preservation of the public use of the widened street, are not stated and are thus left to surmise.\n The plaintiffs alleged in their bills of complaint that the excess condemnation is 'a mere speculation upon an anticipated increase in the value of the properties adjacent to said improvement,' and that the properties were taken 'with the design of reselling the same at a profit to private individuals to be used for private purposes, and no use of said property by or for the public is intended or contemplated.' The answers of the city denied these allegations, and summed up the position of the city by saying that the application of the principle of excess condemnation in these cases would enable the city (1) 'to further the appropriate development of the south side of Fifth Street' by using or disposing of the excess properties in tracts 'with such size and with such restrictions as will inure to the public advantage,' and (2) that the increase in value of the properties in question which may accrue by reason of the improvement contemplated by the \n\n[281 U.S. 439, 444]\n\u00a0\n city 'will pay in part the very heavy expense to which the City will be put in effecting the improvement.'\n On the hearing in the District Court, the plaintiffs and the defendant introduced evidence as to the condition and the value of plaintiffs' properties. There was also a stipulation of evidence as to the amount of money available for the street widening, the expense of the appropriation of the 25-foot strip, and the total expense of the entire proposed appropriation. The stipulation gave a general description of Fifth street and of the improvements of the squares adjoining the widened street. None of the evidence defined in any specific manner the purpose of the excess condemnation.\n The city argues that in resorting to excess condemnation legislative bodies generally have had in view the following three purposes: (1) The avoidance of remnant lots; (2) the preservation and amplification of the improvement; and (3) the recoupment of expense from increased values. Both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the theory of remnants, and of the protection and preservation of the improvement, were not applicable to the present cases. Both courts considered that the sole purpose of the city was the recoupment by the resale of the properties in question of a large part of the expense of the street widening. In this view, both courts held that the excess condemnation was in violation of the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs upon the ground that it was not a taking for a public use 'within the meaning of that term, as it heretofore has been held to justify the taking of private property.' The Circuit Court of Appeals added that the provision of the Constitution of Ohio relating to excess condemnation, supra, 'would seem to mean in furtherance of the normal use to which the property that is occupied by the improvement is devoted-here the use and preservation of the street for the purposes of travel,' \n\n[281 U.S. 439, 445]\n\u00a0\n and the court held that, if the provision means that property may be taken 'for the purpose of selling it at a profit and paying for the improvement, it is clearly invalid.'\n In this Court, the city challenges the propriety of the assumption upon which these rulings below were based, that is, that the city was proceeding on the theory of the recoupment of expense by resale of the properties. While contending that this would be a valid purpose under the Constitution of Ohio, and would constitute a taking for public use, and therefore would be consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, the city insists that its purpose in the present cases cannot thus be delimited. The city calls attention to the general statements in the resolution and ordinance adopted by the city council and declares that these broad declarations constitute 'practically all the evidence which directly shows the purpose of the city.' While reference is made to what is said in its pleadings with respect to its position, the argument for the city adds that 'obviously an impersonality such as a city cannot very well testify as to what its plans and hopes are.' The Court is asked to take judicial notice of certain desirable objects which the city might have in view. The city urges that, when the improvement is completed, the city council will doubtless be in a position to determine what sized tracts and what kinds of restriction will be best suited for the harmonious development of the south side of Fifth street. But the city also insists that it may never resell the excess; that it is not compelled to do so by the Constitution; that the question is one to be determined in the future; that recoupment can come only from a sale; and that, until by some act the city evidences an intent to sell, it cannot be said to be proceeding only on a theory of recoupment. The city says that it may preserve the public use in many ways, and that sale with restrictions is one that may hereafter be \n\n[281 U.S. 439, 446]\n\u00a0\n chosen, but that there is no warrant upon this record for discarding every possible use in favor of a use by sale that may, among other things, result in a possible recoupment.\n We are thus asked to sustain the excess appropriation in these cases upon the bare statements of the resolution and ordinance of the city council, by considering hypothetically every possible, but undefined, use to which the city may put these properties, and by determining that such use will not be repugnant to the rights secured to the property owners by the Fourteenth Amendment. We are thus either to assume that whatever the city, entirely uncontrolled by any specific statement of its purpose, may decide to do with the properties appropriated, will be valid under both the state and Federal Constitutions, or to set up some hypothesis as to use and decide for or against the taking accordingly, although the assumption may be found to be foreign to the actual purpose of the appropriation as ultimately disclosed and the appropriation may thus be sustained or defeated through a misconception of fact.\n It is well established that, in considering the application of the Fourteenth Amendment to cases of expropriation of private property, the question what is a public use is a judicial one. In deciding such a question, the Court has appropriate regard to the diversity of local conditions and considers with great respect legislative declarations and in particular the judgments of state courts as to the uses considered to be public in the light of local exigencies. But the question remains a judicial one which this Court must decide in performing its duty of enforcing the provisions of the Federal Constitution. \n1\n In the present in- \n\n[281 U.S. 439, 447]\n\u00a0\n stance, we have no legislative declaration, apart from the statement of the city council, and no judgment of the state court as to the particular matter before us. Under the provision of the Constitution of Ohio for excess condemnation when a city acquires property for public use, it would seem to be clear that a mere statement by the council that the excess condemnation is in furtherance of such use would not be conclusive. Otherwise, the taking of any land in excess condemnation, although in reality wholly unrelated to the immediate improvement, would be sustained on a bare recital. This would be to treat the constitutional provision as giving such a sweeping authority to municipalities as to make nugatory the express condition upon which the authority is granted.\n To the end that the taking shall be shown to be within its authority, the municipality is called upon to specify definitely the purpose of the appropriation. This is the clear import of the provision of the Ohio statute (Ohio General Code,  3679, supra) that the city council, when it is deemed necessary to appropriate property, shall pass a resolution 'defining the purpose of the appropriation.' It cannot be said that this legislative requirement relates only to the principal appropriation and not to the excess appropriation. It must be deemed to apply, according to its express terms, to every appropriation of private property by a municipality. The importance of the definition of purpose would be even greater in the case of taking property not directly to be occupied by a proposed public improvement than in the case of the latter which might more clearly speak for itself. \n\n[281 U.S. 439, 448]\n\u00a0\n The general declaration of the resolution of the city council, and of the ordinance, if that may be read with the resolution, for the excess condemnation in the present cases, is plainly not a definition. To define is to limit, and that which is left unlimited, and is to be determined only by such future action as the city may hereafter decide upon, is not defined. The city's contention is so broad that it defeats itself. It is not enough that property may be devoted hereafter to a public use for which there could have been an appropriate condemnation. Under the guise of an excess condemnation pursuant to the authority of the constitutional provision of Ohio, private property could not be taken for some independent and undisclosed public use. Either no definition of purpose is required in the case of excess condemnation, a view of the statute which cannot be entertained, or the purpose of the excess condemnation must be suitably defined. In this view, in the absence of such a definition, the appropriation must fail by reason of noncompliance with statutory authority.\n We understand it to be the rule in Ohio, as elsewhere, that the power conferred upon a municipal corporation to take private property for public use must be strictly followed. Harbeck v. Toledo, 11 Ohio St. 219, 222, 223; Grant v. Village of Hyde Park, 67 Ohio St. 166, 172, 173, 65 N. E. 891; Farber v. Toledo, 104 Ohio St. 196, 200, 135 N. E. 533; Roosevelt Hotel Building Co. v. Cleveland, 25 Ohio App. 53, 63, 64, 155 N. E. 233. The validity of the excess condemnation upon the ground of noncompliance with the state law was challenged in the bills of complaint in these suits. The respondents have made the same contention here. The city has not met it by referring us to any decision of the courts of Ohio construing the statute involved or sustaining the excess appropriation in the absence of a definition of purpose. It is an established principle governing the exercise of the jurisdiction of this Court that it will not decide im- \n\n[281 U.S. 439, 449]\n\u00a0\n portant constitutional questions unnecessarily or hypothetically. Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia Steamship Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, \n113 \nU.S. 33, 39\n, 5 S. Ct. 352; Siler v.

The present cases call for the application of this principle. Questions relating to the constitutional validity of an excess condemnation should not be determined upon conjecture as to the contemplated purpose, the object of the excess appropriation not being set forth as required by the local law.\n We conclude that the proceedings for excess condemnation of the properties involved in these suits were not taken in conformity with the applicable law of the state, and in affirming the decrees below upon this ground we refrain from expressing an opinion upon the other questions that have been argued.\n Decrees affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Fallbrook Irrigation District v.

The question turns of the Revenue Act of 1918 ( Act of February 24, 1919), c. 18,  234(a)(7), 40 Stat. 1057, 1078, allowing as deductions, inter alia, 'A reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property used in the trade or business, including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence.' The good will was that of a brewery and is found to have been destroyed by prohibition legislation. The deduction claimed is for the fiscal year ending May 31, 1919, it having been apparent early in 1918 that prohibition was imminent, and the officers having taken steps to prepare for the total or partial liquidation of the Company. The amount of the deduction to be made is agreed upon if any deduction is to be allowed.\n We shall not follow counsel into the succession of regulations or the variations in the law before the date of the Act that we have to construe. In our opinion the words now used cannot be extended to cover the loss in this case and it is needless to speculate as to what other cases it might include. It seems to us plain without help from Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623\n, 8 S. Ct. 273, that when a business is extinguished as noxious under the Constitution the owners cannot demand compensation from the Government, or a partial compensation in the form of an abatement of taxes otherwise due. It seems to us no less plain that Congress cannot be taken to have intended such a partial compensation to be provided for by the words 'exhaustion' or 'obsolescence.' Neither word is apt to describe \n\n[280 U.S. 384, 387]\n\u00a0\n termination by law as an evil of a business otherwise flourishing, and neither becomes more applicable because the death is lingering rather than instantaneous. It is incredible that Congress by an Act approved on February 24, 1919, should have meant to enable parties to cut down their taxes on such grounds because of an amendment to the Constitution that it had submitted to the legislatures of the States in 1917 and that had been ratified by the legislatures of a sufficient number of States the month before the present Act was passed.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice STONE concur in the result. \n\n\n\n","27":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOCHRAN v. LOUISIANA STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION(1930)\nNo. 468\nArgued: April 15, 1930Decided: April 28, 1930\n\n\n\n Messrs. Challen B. Ellis and Wade H. Ellis, both of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n\n\n[281 U.S. 370, 373]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellants, as citizens and taxpayers of the state of Louisiana, brought this suit to restrain the State Board of Education and other state officials from expending any part of the severance tax fund in purchasing school books and in supplying them free of cost to the school children of the state, under Acts No. 100 and No. 143 of 1928, upon the ground that the legislation violated specified provisions of the Constitution of the state and also section 4 of article 4 and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The Supreme Court of the state affirmed the judgment of the trial court which refused to issue an injunction. 168 La. 1030, 123 So. 664. \n\n[281 U.S. 370, 374]\n\u00a0\n Act No. 100 of 1928 provided that the severance tax found of the state, after allowing funds and appropriations as required by the state Constitution, should be devoted 'first, to supplying school books to the school children of the State.' The Board of Education was directed to provide 'school books for school children free of cost to such children.' Act No. 143 of 1928 made appropriations in accordance with the above provisions.\n The Supreme Court of the state, following its decision in Borden v. Louisiana State Board of Education, 168 La. 1005, 123 So. 655, held that these acts were not repugnant to either the state or the Federal Constitution.\n No substantial Federal question is presented under section 4 of article 4 of the Federal Constitution guaranteeing to every state a republican form of government, as questions arising under this provision are political, not judicial, in character. State of Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron Metropolitan Park District, \n281 \nU.S. 74\n, 50 S. Ct. 228, 74 L. Ed. -, decided March 12, 1930, and cases there cited.\n The contention of the appellant under the Fourteenth Amendment is that taxation for the purchase of school books constituted a taking of private property for a private purpose. Citizens' Sav. & Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655. The purpose is said to be to aid private, religious, sectarian, and other schools not embraced in the public educational system of the state by furnishing text-books free to the children attending such private schools. The operation and effect of the legislation in question were described by the Supreme Court of the state as follows (168 La. page 1020, 123 So. 655, 660): 'One may scan the acts in vain to ascertain where any money is appropriated for the purchase of school books for the use of any church, private, sectarian, or even public school. The appropriations were made for the specific purpose of purchasing school books for the use of the school children of the state, free of cost to them. It was \n\n[281 U.S. 370, 375]\n\u00a0\n for their benefit and the resulting benefit to the state that the appropriations were made. True, these children attend some school, public or private, the latter, sectarian or nonsectarian, and that the books are to be furnished them for their use, free of cost, whichever they attend. The schools, however, are not the beneficiaries of these appropriations. They obtain nothing from them, nor are they relieved of a single obligation, because of them. The school children and the state alone are the beneficiaries. It is also true that the sectarian schools, which some of the children attend, instruct their pupils in religion, and books are used for that purpose, but one may search diligently the acts, though without result, in an effort to find anything to the effect that it is the purpose of the state to furnish religious books for the use of such children. ... What the statutes contemplate is that the same books that are furnished children attending public schools shall be furnished children attending private schools. This is the only practical way of interpreting and executing the statutes, and this is what the state board of education is doing. Among these books, naturally, none is to be expected, adapted to religious instruction.' The court also stated, although the point is not of importance in relation to the Federal question, that it was 'only the use of the books that is granted to the children, or, in other words, the books are lent to them.'\n Viewing the statute as having the effect thus attributed to it, we cannot doubt that the taxing power of the state is exerted for a public purpose. The legislation does not segregate private schools, or their pupils, as its beneficiaries or attempt to interfere with any matters of exclusively private concern. Its interest is education, broadly; its method, comprehensive. Individual interests are aided only as the common interest is safeguarded.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOLLIE v. FERGUSSON(1930)\nNo. 423\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1930\n\n\n\n Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz, of Newport News, Va., for petitioners. \n\n[281 U.S. 52, 53]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leon T. Seawell and Henry Bowden, both of Norfolk, Va., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on writ of certiorari, granted October 28, 1929, to review a decree (31 F.(2d) 1010) of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which affirmed, without opinion, a decree of the District Court of Eastern Virginia, denying, also without opinion, the claims of petitioners, who are seamen, for double wages for 'waiting time,' under Rev. St.  4529, Tit. 46, U. S. Code,  596 (46 USCA  596) (Act of July 20, 1790, c. 29,  6, 1 Stat. 133; Act June 7, 1872, c. 322,  35, 17 Stat. 269, as amended, Act December 21, 1898, c. 28,  4, 30 Stat. 756; Act March 4, 1915, c. 153,  3, 38 Stat. 1164).\n The power boat Dola Lawson, licensed for coastwise trade, and Fergusson, her owner, were libeled for repairs and materials supplied to the vessel. Intervening petitions were filed, setting up claims for wages and the statutory allowance for waiting time in the case of the present petitioners, and for repairs, materials, and supplies in the case of other libelants. The vessel was sold by order of the court, and the proceeds, which are insufficient to satisfy the claims allowed, were paid into the registry of the court to the credit of the cause.\n The employment of two of the petitioners was terminated by the seizure of the vessel. That of the third, Rowe, was terminated by mutual consent some six months before the seizure. There was evidence from which the trial court might have concluded that he consented to deferred payment of his wages because of the financial necessities of the owner. It was admitted on the argument that the owner, because of his insolvency, was unable to pay seamen's wages and that petitioners must look alone to the proceeds of the vessel for the satisfaction of their \n\n[281 U.S. 52, 54]\n\u00a0\n claims, admissions which find support in the confused, and in many respects unsatisfactory, record.\n The District Court denied petitioners' claims for double wages for waiting time, but decreed payment of the wages due, with interest, as prior liens. Although the other lienors did not appeal, the court, at their instance, but for reasons which do not appear, suspended the decree pending the appeal, so that the wages allowed could not be paid from the proceeds of the vessel. To the amounts found due the petitioners, the Court of Appeals added interest until payment.\n Section 4529 (46 USCA  596), so far as relevant, provides: 'The master or owner of any vessel making coasting voyages shall pay to every seaman his wages within two days after the termination of the agreement under which he was shipped, or at the time such seaman is discharged, whichever first happens. ... Every master or owner who refuses or neglects to make payment in the manner hereinbefore mentioned without sufficient cause shall pay to the seaman a sum equal to two days' pay for each and every day during which payment is delayed, ... which sum shall be recoverable as wages in any claim made before the court. ...'\n The claim for double wages which, when valid, is by the terms of the statute 'recoverable as wages,' has been held to be embraced in the seaman's lien for wages, with priority over other liens, and governed by the procedure applicable to suits for the recovery of seamen's wages. The Trader (D. C.) 17 F.(2d) 623; Gerber v. Spencer (C. C. A.) 278 F. 886; The Nika (D. C.) 287 F. 717; The Great Canton (D. C.) 299 F. 953; The Fort Gaines (D. C.) 18 F.(2d) 413; The St. Paul (D.

The Morning Star (D. C.) 1 F.(2d) 410, 411. \n\n[281 U.S. 52, 55]\n\u00a0\n With these rulings as a premise, petitioners argue that the statutory allowance is compensatory; that it accrues upon mere delay in payment of wages, and may be recovered by including it in petitioners' liens for wages, which have priority over the liens of materialmen, notwithstanding the general rule that events subsequent to the seizure do not give rise to liens against a vessel in custodia legis. See The Young America (D. C.) 30 F. 789, 790; The Nisseqogue (D. C.) 280 F. 174, 181; The Grapeshot (D. C.) 22 F. 123. Cf. New York Dock Co. v. The Poznan, \n274 \nU.S. 117\n, 47 S. Ct. 482.\n But the increased payment for waiting time is not denominated wages by the statute, and the direction that it shall be recovered as wages does not purport to affect the condition prerequisite to its accrual that refusal or neglect to pay shall be without sufficient cause. The phrase 'without sufficient cause' must be taken to embrace something more than valid defenses to the claim for wages. Otherwise, it would have added nothing to the statute. In determining what other causes are sufficient, the phrase is to be interpreted in the light of the evident purpose of the section to secure prompt payment of seamen's wages (H. R. Rep. 1657, Committee on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries, 55th Cong., 2d Sess.), and thus to protect them from the harsh consequences of arbitrary and unscrupulous action of their employers, to which, as a class, they are peculiarly exposed.\n The words 'refuses or neglects to make payment ... without sufficient cause' connote, either conduct which is in some sense arbitrary or willful, or at least a failure not attributable to impossibility of payment. We think the use of this language indicates a purpose to protect seamen from delayed payments of wages by the imposion of a liability which is not exclusively compensatory, \n\n[281 U.S. 52, 56]\n\u00a0\n but designed to prevent, by its coercive effect, arbitrary refusals to pay wages, and to induce prompt payment when payment is possible. Hence we conclude that the liability is not imposed regardless of the fault of the master or owner, or his retention of any interest in the vessel from which payment could be made. It can afford no such protection and exert no effective coercive force where delay in payment, as here, is due to the insolvency of the owner and the arrest of the vessel, subject to accrued claims beyond its value. Together these obstacles to payment of wages must be taken to be a sufficient cause to relieve from the statutory liability. The Trader, supra; Feldman v. American Palestine Line, Inc. (D. C.) 25 F.( 2d) 1002. Cf. Gerber v. Spencer, supra. Otherwise, it would not be imposed on the owner directly or through his interest in the ship, but only upon the lienors, who are neither within the letter nor the spirit of the statute.\n That the liability is not incurred where the refusal to pay is in some reasonable degree morally justified, or where the demand for wages cannot be satisfied either by the owner or his interest in the ship, has been the conclusion reached with practical unanimity by the lower federal courts.

C., for defendants James Duane Duncan and others.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In September, 1928, the commonwealth of Kentucky and the state of Indiana, by their respective highway commissions, entered into a contract for the building of a bridge across the Ohio river between Evansville, Ind ., and Henderson, Ky. The contract was approved by the Governor, and as to legality and form, also by the Attorney General, of each state. The contract recited the acts of Congress and of the state Legislatures which were deemed to authorize the enterprise. Acts of Congress of July 11, 1916, 39 Stat. 355, 356; March 2, 1927, 44 Stat. 1337; March 3, 1927, 44 Stat. 1398, Indiana, Act of 1919, c. 53; Act of 1927, c. 10, Kentucky, Acts of 1928, chapters 172 and 174. The state of Indiana immediately began the performance of the covenants of the contract on its part, and thereupon nine citizens and taxpayers of Indiana brought suit in the superior court of Marion county in that state to enjoin the members of the highway commission and other officers of Indiana from carrying out the contract upon the ground that it was unauthorized and void.\n The commonwealth of Kentucky then asked leave to file the bill of complaint in this suit against the state of Indiana and the individuals who were plaintiffs in the suit in the state court, seeking to restrain the breach of the contract and the prosecution of that suit, and for specific performance. In its return to the order to show \n\n[281 U.S. 163, 170]\n\u00a0\n cause why this leave should not be granted the state of Indiana said that it had 'no cause to show'; that the state intended ultimately to perform the contract, if performance were permitted or ordered by the courts in which the litigation over the contract was pending, but that it did not intend to do so until after that litigation had finally been disposed of favorably to its performance; that the state of Indiana had entered into the contract by virtue of authority of its own statutes and of the Act of Congress of March 2, 1927; that, as there was no court having complete jurisdiction over the parties and subject-matter, other than this court, the state yielded to the jurisdiction of this court, and that it was in the public interest that an early adjudication be had which would be final and binding upon all parties interested.\n Leave being granted, the bill of complaint herein was filed. It set forth the contract and the pertinent statutes, the pendency of the Indiana suit (to which the commonwealth of Kentucky was not, and could not be made, a party), that the delay in the construction of the bridge would cause irreparable injury to the commonwealth of Kentucky, and that the complainant had no adequate remedy other than through this suit. The complaint further alleged that the northern approach to the bridge would rest on and extend over Indiana soil and the southern approach would be on Kentucky soil; that the state of Indiana as well as the commonwealth of Kentucky had full authority to enter into the contract under the state statutes cited, and that the contract was also authorized by the acts of Congress to which reference was made. The complaint was later amended to correct an inaccurate citation.\n Separate answers were filed by the state of Indiana and by the individual defendants. The answer of the state of Indiana admitted that the allegations of the complaint were true. The answer then averred:\n\n\n[281 U.S. 163, 171]\n\u00a0\n 'The only excuse which the State of Indiana offers for failure to perform the contract set out in plaintiff's complaint is the litigation, mentioned in the complaint, instituted by her above-named co-defendants against the officers of the State of Indiana whose function it is to perform said contract. The resulting delay in performance of said contract is in breach of its terms, which contemplate immediate and continued performance.'\n After stating that, as the validity of the contract had been drawn in question in the litigation in the state court, the state did not feel warranted in proceeding until there was a final adjudication establishing its right to perform, the answer added:\n'The State of Indiana believes said contract is valid. If this honorable court shall grant the relief prayed against Indiana by plaintiff Commonwealth of Kentucky in either of its paragraphs of complaint, the State of Indiana will thereupon immediately proceed with the performance of said contract and will continue such performance until the objects of said contract shall have been fully attained as contemplated by the terms thereof.'\n\n The individual defendants filed an answer and, it the same time, moved to dismiss the complaint upon the ground that there was no controversy between the two states or between the commonwealth of Kentucky and the individual defendants; that under section 265 of the Judicial Code no injunction should be granted staying proceedings in the suit in the state court; that the proceedings involved the interpretation of the statutes and laws of Indiana; that the contract was not binding on the State of Indiana, being made without authority of law; and that the commonwealth of Kentucky had an adequate remedy at law. The answer of the individual defendants admitted the making of the contract, but denied its validity. The parties, pursuant to a stipulation, \n\n[281 U.S. 163, 172]\n\u00a0\n moved to submit the case upon the pleadings and briefs, including the separate motion of the individual defendants to dismiss. The motion to submit was denied, the motion to dismiss was postponed, and the case was assigned for oral argument. Later, the commonwealth of Kentucky moved to strike out the answers and for a decree pro confesso.\n After hearing argument, the court overruled the motion to dismiss in so far as it questioned the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the bill of complaint and to proceed to a hearing and determination of the merits of the controversy, and directed that all other questions sought to be presented by that motion be reserved for further consideration at the hearing upon the merits.\n A statement of facts, to which the complainant, the defendant state, and the individual defendants agreed, was then filed. It admitted the allegations of the complaint with respect to the enactment of the various statutes mentioned and the making of the contract. It set forth that the state of Indiana by its highway commission and proper officers were 'now ready and anxious to perform said contract,' but would not do so until there was a final adjudication by the Supreme Court of Indiana or by this court; that it was of great interest and concern to both states that the litigation should be determined as early as possible, consistently with the convenience of the court; that the failure of the state of Indiana promptly to perform the covenants of the contract on its part had caused and will cause the commonwealth of Kentucky injury and damage for which no adequate remedy at law exists; and that the commonwealth of Kentucky was, and had been, 'ready, able and willing' to perform the covenants of the contract on its part. It was also stated that all the allegations made by the state of Indiana in its answer were true. There was fur- \n\n[281 U.S. 163, 173]\n\u00a0\n ther agreement to the effect that the blueprints and drawings filed herein correctly showed the location approved for the bridge by both states, the boundary line between the states, the location of the spans, bridge structure and approaches, the high-water lines, and the topography at the site of the bridge. It was agreed that the individual defendants were citizens, voters, and taxpayers of Indiana and the operators of automobiles on which they paid license fees to that state. Pursuant to a stipulation, the highway commission of Indiana filed a statement showing the appropriations made by that state bearing upon the construction of the bridge.\n A motion to set the cause for hearing upon the pleadings and the agreed statement of facts was granted, and the cause has been heard.\n The question of the jurisdiction of this court was determined on the hearing of the motion to dismiss. The state of Indiana, while desiring to perform its contract, is not going on with its performance because of a suit brought by its citizens in its own court. There is thus a controversy between the states, although a limited one.\n A state suing, or sued, in this court, by virtue of the original jurisdiction over controversies between states, must be deemed to represent all its citizens. The appropriate appearance here of a state by its proper officers, either as complainant or defendant, is conclusive upon this point. Citizens, voters, and taxpayers, merely as such, of either state, without a showing of any further and proper interest, have no separate individual right to contest in such a suit the position taken by the state itself. Otherwise, all the citizens of both states, as one citizen, voter, and taxpayer has as much right as another in this respect, would be entitled to be heard. An individual citizen may be made a party where relief is properly sought as against him, and in such case he should have \n\n[281 U.S. 163, 174]\n\u00a0\n suitable opportunity to show the nature of his interest and why the relief asked against him individually should not be granted.\n If the controversy within the original jurisdiction of this court is over a contract alleged to have been made between two states, to which an individual defendant is not a party, it is manifest that such an individual defendant, merely as a citizen, voter, and taxpayer of the defendant state, is not entitled to enter upon a separate contest in relation to the merits of the controversy so far as it relates to the making of the contract by the two states, and the obligations that the contract imposes upon his state, and does not relate to any separate and proper interest of his own. The fact that an individual citizen in such a case is made a party defendant in order that the complainant may obtain some particular relief against him, which is merely incidental to the complete relief to which the complainant would be entitled if it should prevail as against the defendant state, gives such an individual defendant no standing to litigate on his own behalf the merits of a controversy which, properly viewed, lies solely between the states, but only to contest the propriety of the particular relief sought against him in case the decision on the merits is against his state. This gives an individual defendant in such a suit between states full opportunity to litigate the only question which concerns him individually as distinguished from the questions which concern him only in common with all the citizens of his state.\n In the present instance, there is no showing that the individual defendants have any interest whatever with respect to the contract and its performance other than that of the citizens and taxpayers, generally, of Indiana, an interest which that state in this suit fully represents. The individual defendants have presented no defense \n\n[281 U.S. 163, 175]\n\u00a0\n other than that which they seek to make on behalf of their state with respect to the making of the contract by that state and the obligations thereby imposed upon it. The particular relief asked against them is sought only as an incident to the relief which the commonwealth of Kentucky seeks against the state of Indiana. The individual defendants were made parties solely for the purpose of obtaining an injunction against them restraining the prosecution of the suit in the state court. Such an injunction is not needed, as a decree in this suit would bind the state of Indiana, and, on being shown, would bar any inconsistent proceedings in the courts of that state. As no sufficient ground appears for maintaining the bill of complaint against the individual defendants, it should be dismissed as against them.\n The question, then, is as to the case made by the commonwealth of Kentucky against the state of Indiana. By admitting in its answer that the allegations of the complaint are true, the state of Indiana admits the making of the contract and the authority of its officers to make it under the applicable legislation. Not only are the allegations of fact in the complaint conceded to be true, but there is also no dispute as to the legal import of these facts. Instead of presenting any legal ground for contesting the validity of the contract, the state of Indiana expressly asserts in its answer that it believes the contract is valid. There is no suggestion of any inadvertence in the answer. On the contrary, it is the deliberate statement of the position of the state of Indiana in the light of the litigation in the state court and of the questions there sought to be raised. The only suggestion of a defense for its failure to perform the contract, that is, what the state of Indiana in its answer characterizes as its 'only excuse,' is the pendency of this litigation in the state court. The state of Indiana avers that it \n\n[281 U.S. 163, 176]\n\u00a0\n does not feel warranted in proceeding in the absence of a final determination establishing its right to proceed under the contract.\n It is manifest that if, in accordance with the pleading of each state, the contract for the building of the bridge is deemed to be authorized and valid, the mere pendency of a suit brought by citizens to restrain performance does not constitute a defense. In that aspect, the question would be, not as to a defense on the merits, but whether this court should withhold a final determination merely because of the fact that such a suit is pending. This question raises important considerations. It cannot be gainsaid that in a controversy with respect to a contract between states, as to which the original jurisdiction of this court is invoked, this court has the authority and duty to determine for itself all questions that pertain to the obligations of the contract alleged. The fact that the solution of these questions may involve the determination of the effect of the local legislation of either state, as well as of acts of Congress, which are said to authorize the contract, in no way affects the duty of this court to act as the final, constitutional arbiter in deciding the questions properly presented It has frequently been held that, when a question is suitably raised whether the law of a state has impaired the obligation of a contract, in violation of the constitutional provision, this court must determine for itself whether a contract exists, what are its obligations, and whether they have been impaired by the legislation of the state. While this court always examines with appropriate respect the decisions of state courts bearing upon such questions, such decisions do not detract from the responsibility of this court in reaching its own conclusions as to the contract, its obligations and impairment, for otherwise the constitutional guaranty could not properly be enforced. Larson v. South Dakota, \n278 \nU.S. 429, 433\n, 49 S. Ct. 196, and cases there cited. Where the \n\n[281 U.S. 163, 177]\n\u00a0\n states themselves are before this court for the determination of a controversy between them, neither can determine their rights inter sese, and this court must pass upon every question essential to such a determination, although local legislation and questions of state authorization may be involved. Virginia v. West Virginia, 11 Wall, 39, 56; Id., \n220 \nU.S. 1, 28\n, 31 S. Ct. 330. A decision in the present instance by the state court would not determine the controversy here.\n It is none the less true that this court might await such a decision, in order that it might have the advantage of the views of the state court, if sufficient grounds appeared for delaying final action. The question is as to the existence of such grounds in this case. The gravity of the situation cannot be ignored. The injury to the commonwealth of Kentucky by the delay in the performance of the contract by the state of Indiana is definitely alleged and expressly admitted. That injury is concededly irreparable, without adequate remedy at law. It is specifically set forth in the agreed statement of facts that 'it is of great interest and concern to the States of Indiana and Kentucky and the United States and the citizens thereof generally who will travel said Route 41' (the highway through the states which will be made continuous by the construction of the bridge) 'to have as early determination of this litigation as is possible.' In these circumstances there would appear to be no adequate ground for withholding the determination of this suit because of objections raised by individuals, merely in their capacity as citizens, voters, and taxpayers of Indiana, objections which the state itself declines to sponsor.\n It would be a serious matter, where a state has entered into a contract with another state, the validity of the contract not being questioned by either state, if individual citizens could delay the prompt performance which was admittedly important, not only to the com- \n\n[281 U.S. 163, 178]\n\u00a0\n plainant state but to the people of both states, merely by bringing a suit. It is not difficult to institute suits, and contracts between states, of increasing importance as interstate interests grow in complexity, would be at the mercy of individuals, if the action of the latter, without more, unsupported by any proper averments on the part of the state itself questioning its obligations, should lead this court to stay its hand in giving the relief to which the complainant state would otherwise be entitled, and of which it stood seriously in need.\n On such a record as we have in this case, it is unnecessary for the court to search the legislation underlying the contract in order to discover grounds of defense which the defendant state does not attempt to assert. The state of Indiana concludes its answer by saying that, if a decree goes against it as prayed for, the state will at once proceed with the performance of the contract and fully complete that performance according to its terms.\n We conclude that the controversy between the states is within the original jurisdiction of this court; that the defendant state has shown no adequate defense to this suit; that nothing appears which would justify delay in rendering a decree; and that the commonwealth of Kentucky is entitled to the relief sought against the state of Indiana.\n The complainant and the defendant state will be accorded twenty days within which to submit a form of decree to carry these conclusions into effect. Costs will be divided equally between the states.\n Dismissed as to individual defendants.\n Decree for complainant against the defendant state. \n\n\n\n","31":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOOPER v.

Hughes, Jr., Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., \n\n[280 U.S. 409, 410]\n\u00a0\n for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner paid income taxes assessed according to her return for the calendar year 1921; thereafter, by suit in the Court of Claims, she sought to recover a portion of the same ($8,474.90), with interest, which she alleged had been improperly exacted.\n Her return showed $36,670 as gain derived from the sale of 380 shares of bank stock sold November 7, 1921, at $210 per share. She acquired this stock November 1, 1921, by gift from her husband. On that day its fair market value was $210 per share; in 1918 it cost her husband $113.50 per share.\n The challenged assessment was made under section 202(a)(2), Revenue Act, November 23, 1921, effective (section 263) January 1, 1921. Chapter 136, 42 Stat. 227, 229.\n'Sec. 202(a).

In the case of such property acquired by gift on or before December 31, 1920, the basis for ascertaining gain or loss from a sale or other disposition thereof shall be the fair market price or value of such property at the time of such acquisition. ...'\n\n The Court of Claims decided against the petitioner; and the cause is here upon certiorari. She maintains- \n\n[280 U.S. 409, 411]\n\u00a0\n First, that section 202(a)(2) should not be construed as applicable to transactions fully completed before enactment of the statute. Second, that if construed to apply where both gift and sale were consummated before such enactment, the section is arbitrary and capricious, and, therefore invalid under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n The support the first point Shwab v. Doyle, \n258 \nU.S. 529\n, 42 S. Ct. 391, 26 A. L. R. 1454, is cited; for the second Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081; Blodgett v.

Ct. 353, are relied upon.\n We think the purpose of Congress to apply the provisions of section 202(a)(2) to the transaction here involved is clear. Shwab v. Doyle grew out of the Revenue Act of September 8, 1916 (39 Stat. 758). There, after considering the relevant circumstances, we declared there was no intention to give retroactive effect to the enactment. Here, the contrary design is not doubtful.\n The power of Congress to tax as part of a donee's income the difference between what the gift cost the donor and the price received therefor when sold by the donee was affirmed in Taft v. Bowers, \n278 \nU.S. 470\n, 49 S. Ct. 199, and is not now denied.\n That the questioned provision cannot be declared in conflict with the Federal Constitution merely because it requires gains from prior but recent transactions to be treated as part of the taxpayer's gross income has not been open to serious doubt since Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R., \n240 \nU.S. 1\n, 36 S. Ct. 236, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713, and Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 \nU.S. 339\n, 38 S. Ct. 543\n\n\n Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081, held arbitrary and capricious a statute which required executors to pay an excise ostensibly laid upon the transfer of property by death, but reckoned upon its value plus the value of other property conveyed by the decedent before the enactment in entire good faith, and without contemplation of death, and said that to enforce it would amount to confiscation. \n\n[280 U.S. 409, 412]\n\u00a0\n Blodgett v. Holden, \n275 \nU.S. 142\n, 48 S. Ct. 105, and Untermyer v. Anderson, \n276 \nU.S. 440\n, 48 S. Ct. 353, considered the validity of an enactment which laid a tax upon donors because of gifts fully consummated prior to its passage. We held this was beyond the power of Congress. None of these cases is in point; they gave no consideration to the power of Congress to require that taxable income should include profits from transactions consummated within the year.\n We can find nothing unusual, arbitrary, or capricious in the provision of the taxing act here involved, and the judgment of the court below must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCORLISS v. BOWERS(1930)\nNo. 344\nArgued: Decided: April 28, 1930\n\n\n\n Mr. Joseph M. Hartfield, of New York City, for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Charles E. Hughes, Jr., Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for respondent. \n\n[281 U.S. 376, 377]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover the amount of an income tax paid by the plaintiff, the petitioner, under the Revenue Act of 1924, June 2, 1924, c. 234,  219(g) (h), 43 Stat. 253, 277 (U. S. C. tit. 26,  960 (26 USCA  960, note)). The complaint was dismissed by the District Court, 30 F.(2d) 135, and the judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 34 F.( 2d) 656. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court.\n The question raised by the petitioner is whether the above section of the Revenue Act can be applied constitutionally to him upon the following facts. In 1922 he transferred the fund from which arose the income in respect of which the petitioner was taxed, to trustees, in trust to pay the income to his wife for life with remainder over to their children. By the instrument creating the trust the petition reserved power 'to modify or alter in any manner, or revoke in whole or in part, this indenture and the trusts then existing, and the estates and interests in property hereby created,' etc. It is not necessary to quote more words because there can be no doubt that the petitioner fully reserved the power at any moment to abolish or change the trust at his will. The statute referred to provides that 'where the grantor of a trust has, at any time during the taxable year, ... the power to revest in himself title to any part of the corpus of the trust, then the income of such part of the trust for such taxable year shall be included in computing the net income of the grantor.' Section 219(g) with other similar provisions as to income in section 219(h ). There can be no doubt either that the statute purports to tax the plaintiff in this case. But the net income for 1924 was paid over to the petitioner's wife and the petitioner's argument is that however it might have been in different circumstances \n\n[281 U.S. 376, 378]\n\u00a0\n the income never was his and he cannot be taxed for it. The legal estate was in the trustee and the quitable interest in the wife.\n But taxation is not so much concerned with the refinements of title as it is with actual command over the property taxed-the actual benefit for which the tax is paid. If a man directed his bank to pay over income as received to a servant or friend, until further orders, no one would doubt that he could be taxed upon the amounts so paid. It is answered that in that case he would have a title, whereas here he did not. But from the point of view of taxation there would be no difference. The title would merely mean a right to stop the payment before it took place. The same right existed here although it is not called a title but is called a power. The acquisition by the wife of the income became complete only when the plaintiff failed to exercise the power that he reserved. Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260, 271\n, 48 S. Ct. 225; Chase National Bank v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 327\n, 49 S. Ct. 126, 63 A. L. R. 388; Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339\n, 49 S. Ct. 123. Still speaking with reference to taxation, if a man disposes of a fund in such a way that another is allowed to enjoy the income which it is in the power of the first to appropriate it does not matter whether the permission is given by assent or by failure to express dissent. The income that is subject to a man's unfettered command and that he is free to enjoy at his own opinion may be taxed to him as his income, whether he sees fit to enjoy it or not. We consider the case too clear to need help from the local law of New York or from arguments based on the power of Congress to prevent escape from taxes or surtaxes by devices that easily might be applied to that end.\n Judgment affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in this case. \n\n\n\n","33":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCORN EXCHANGE BANK v. COLER(1930)\nNo. 36\nArgued: November 27, 1929Decided: January 6, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 218, 219]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Spotswood D. Bowers, of New York City, for appellant.\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 218, 220]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Joseph Lilly and George P. Nicholson, both of New York City, for appellee.\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 218, 221]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The commissioner of public welfare complained to the Domestic Relations Court that, while residing with them in New York City, Raffaele De Stefano abandoned his wife and infant child and absconded from the state, leaving them without means and likely, unless relieved, to become public charges. Upon the wife's supporting affidavit, two magistrates of the court issued a warrant authorizing seizure of all the absconding husband's right, title, and interest in his deposit with appellant bank and make return to the County Court. After service and demand, the bank refused to pay. Thereupon the commissioner by complaint in the City Court sought to reduce the fund to his possession. The bank moved for judgment upon the ground that the statute-basis of the warrant-failed to provide for notice, either actual or constructive, to the absconder, and could not be enforced without denying the due process of law guaranteed by both State and Federal Constitutions. It prevailed in the City Court. The Appellate Term (Coler v. Corn Exchange Bank, 132 Misc. Rep. 449, 230 N. Y. S. 86) reversed that action and directed judgment for the commissioner, and this was approved by the Court of Appeals. 250 N. Y. 136, 164 N. E. 882.\n Sections 921, 922, 923, 924, 925, New York Code of Criminal Procedure, under which the original warrant issued, provide, in substance: That the commissioner of public welfare may apply to two magistrates for a warrant to seize the property of an absconding husband or father leaving wife or child likely to become charges on the public; that, upon due proof of the facts, the warrant may be issued; that the officer receiving it may seize the \n\n[280 U.S. 218, 222]\n\u00a0\n property wherever found within his county, and shall be vested with all the rights and title thereto which the person absconding then had; that return of all proceedings under the warrant shall be made to the next term of the County Court; that thereupon that court, upon inquiring into the circumstances of the case, may confirm or discharge the warrant and seizure; that, in the event of confirmation, the court shall from time to time direct what part of the property shall be sold, and how the proceeds shall be applied to the maintenance of spouse or children; and, on the other hand, that, if the party against whom the warrant has issued, shall return and support the spouse or children so abandoned, or give satisfactory security for such support, then the warrant shall be discharged, and the property restored.\n The Court of Appeals ruled that jurisdiction of the magistrates to issue the warrant and of the County Court to enter a confirmatory judgment depend upon existence of the relation sought to be regulated; that 'the victim of the seizure may nullify the whole proceedings, including any adjudication attempted in his absence, if there is lacking the jurisdictional relation which is the basis of his duty.' Thus limited, it upheld the enactment as a proper regulation of family relation and affirmed the judgment in the Commissioner's favor for the amount claimed in his complaint.\n The challenged procedure is an ancient one. In 1718 the Parliament of England enacted a statute reciting a like ill and prescribing like remedy. The New York colonial Legislature passed a substantially similar law in 1773; the state Legislature in 1784, and again in 1788. This passed into the Revised Laws of 1813; afterwards, broadened to subject choses in action to seizure, into the Revised Statutes of 1829. Without material change it has continued in effect, and has been enforced unquestioned until the present action. \n\n[280 U.S. 218, 223]\n\u00a0\n In Ownbey v. Morgan, \n256 \nU.S. 94, 112\n, 41 S. Ct. 433, 438, 17 A. L. R. 873, we upheld certain rather harsh legislation of the state of Delaware modeled on the custom of London and dating back to colonial days. Its validity, challenged because of alleged conflict with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, was sustained because of the origin and antiquity of the provisions.\n'However desirable it is that the old forms of procedure be improved with the progress of time, it cannot rightly be said that the Fourteenth Amendment furnishes a universal and self-executing remedy. Its function is negative, not affirmative, and it carries no mandate for particular measures of reform. For instance, it does not constrain the states to accept particular modern doctrines of equity, or adopt a combined system of law and equity procedure, or dispense with all necessity for form and method in pleading, or give untrammeled liberty to make amendments. Neither does it, as we think, require a state to relieve the hardship of an ancient and familiar method of procedure by dispensing with the exaction of special security from an appearing defendant in foreign attachment.'\n\n Following the reasoning of that cause, we think the statute here under consideration cannot be said to offend the Federal Constitution.\n That the appellant bank under some remote possibility may be called upon to pay a second time is true; but, when voluntarily contracting with the depositor, it knew this and accepted the consequent responsibility. Under the approved practice there was abundant opportunity to make defense- to require proof of all essential facts. At all events, its position is not materially worse than that of a debtor who must pay one who holds letters testamentary issued upon proof of death, though in truth the creditor may be alive with power to repudiate the appointment.

Ratliff, both of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellants.\n Mr. Robert M. Rainey, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the appellee, William Lowe, to restrain the Corporation Commission of Oklahoma from issuing a license to the Farmers' Union Co-operative Gin Company to construct and operate a cotton gin at Packingtown, Okl. The appellee operates a cotton gin at Capitol Hill, Oklahoma City, under a license issued by the Corporation Commission, and the ground of the suit was that the issuing of a license to the Farmers' Union Co-operative Gin Company, in view of the privileges with which that company would be able to operate under the applicable statute of Oklahoma, would constitute an injurious invasion of the appellee's business and an unreasonable discrimination against him, thus depriving him of his property without due process of law and denying him the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.\n The District Court, composed of three judges, entered a final decree granting a permanent injunction against the issuing of the license, and the defendants in the suit, the Corporation Commission and the Farmers' Union Co-operative Gin Company, have brought this appeal. \n\n[281 U.S. 431, 433]\n\u00a0\n Upon the hearing in the District Court there was an agreed statement of facts, from which it appears that the appellant company is a domestic corporation of Oklahoma organized under article 19 of chapter 34, Compiled Statutes of Oklahoma of 1921; that the company filed with the Corporation Commission an application for a license to operate a cotton gin as a public utility at Packingtown, a part of Oklahoma City; that the place where it was proposed to locate the gin is about two and one-half miles from appellee's gin at Capitol Hill; that the appellee also operates a cotton gin at Wheatland, Okl., about ten miles from the proposed site of the gin of the appellant company; and that these gins of the appellee and of the appellant company would be in the same cotton producing territory and would be in competition. It was also agreed that the appellee had filed with the Corporation Commission his written protest against the granting of the license to the appellant company; that the Corporation Commission had heard the application and considered the objection, and that, unless restrained by the court, the Corporation Commission would issue the license to the appellant company, and its proposed gin would be put in operation.\n The bill of complaint alleged that cotton gins are public utilities under the law of Oklahoma and that the Corporation Commission is vested with authority to regulate them and to fix the rates, charges, and rules to be observed in their operation. There is no controversy upon these points. The dispute grows out of the privileges accorded by statute to the appellant company as a corporation formed to conduct business upon a cooperative plan. Compiled Statutes of 1921,  5637-5652, as amended in 1923 (Laws Okl. 1923, c. 167). The particular statutory provision involved is found in section 5648, as follows:\n'Dividends and profits-reserve fund. The directors, subject to revision by the stockholders, at any general or \n\n[281 U.S. 431, 434]\n\u00a0\n special meeting lawfully called, shall apportion the net earnings and profits thereof from time to time at least once in each year in the following manner:\n\n'(1) Not less than ten per cent. thereof accruing since the last apportionment shall be set aside in a surplus or reserve fund until such fund shall equal at least fifty per cent. of the paid up capital stock.\n\n'(2) Dividends at a rate not to exceed eight per cent. per annum, may, in the discretion of the directors, be declared upon the paid up capital stock. Five per cent may be set aside for educational purposes.\n\n'(3) The remainder of such net earnings and profits shall be apportioned and paid to its members ratably upon the amounts of the products sold to the corporation by its members, and the amounts of the purchases of members from the corporation: provided, that if the by-laws of the corporation shall so provide the directors may apportion such earnings and profits in part to nonmembers upon the amounts of their purchases and sales from or to the corporation.'\n\n The precise contention of the appellee is that under this statute, if a license is granted to appellant company, it will be able to carry on its business on more favorable terms than are available to the appellee, since, it is said, it 'will be compelled, although engaged in a regulated public business as a public utility, to grant refunds and rebates to its patron members and will have the right and privilege of making such refunds and rebates to nonmember patrons upon the amount of their patronage.' The appellee argues that he is prohibited from making refunds and rebates, and is compelled, in the performance of his public duty, to charge rates fixed by the Corporation Commission, which will compel him to compete with appellant gin company upon unequal terms. \n\n[281 U.S. 431, 435]\n\u00a0\n In Frost v. Corporation Commission of Oklahoma, \n278 \nU.S. 515\n, 49 S. Ct. 235, the Court concluded that one who had complied with the statutes of Oklahoma, and had obtained a permit to operate a cotton gin, held a franchise which constituted a property right, and that, while this right did not preclude the state from making similar valid grants to others, it was an exclusive right as against attempts to operate a competing gin without a permit or under a void permit. In this view, it was decided that a state statute which permitted an individual to engage in such a business only upon his first showing a public necessity, but allowed a corporation to engage in the same business, in the same locality, without such a showing, discriminated against the individual in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The appellee invokes the principle of this decision upon the ground that in the present case he will be subject, under the state law, to an unjustifiable discrimination in the competition which will ensue if a license is granted to the appellant company.\n The appellants take issue with this contention. They urge, in substance, that at best the appellee's complaint is premature, that he has not yet suffered, and does not know that he will suffer, any injury as a result of the statutory provision of which he complains. But if the appellant company, by virtue of the statute, is placed on a more favorable basis in the conduct of its business, by being able to hold out to its patrons the prospect of returns which the appellee by reason of the law binding upon him cannot offer to his patrons, it is apparent that the injury of this discrimination may be inflicted at the outset.\n Assuming that the complaint is not premature in this respect, and that the discrimination, if it exists under the law, would be immediately effective, we are brought to \n\n[281 U.S. 431, 436]\n\u00a0\n the question whether the appellee is prevented by the law of Oklahoma from offering, and actually making, a distribution of profits to his patrons similar to that permitted by the statute in the case of the appellant company. The appellee is an individual, transacting business as such, as his bill of complaint shows, and he is not bound by provisions governing corporate organization. He must conduct the business of cotton ginning in conformity with the law of the state, but he may deal with the profits of that business as he sees fit, if he does not act contrary to that law. The question is not as to the mere economic advantage or disadvantage to an individual owner of a cotton gin of a distribution of net earnings upon a basis similar to that permitted by the statute in the case of the appellant company, or of the mere disinclination of an individual owner to make such a distribution. The question is whether the appellant company has a privilege under the statute in this respect which the law of the state refuses to the appellee, and hence the appellee is denied the equal protection of the laws.\n The statutes of Oklahoma characterize the business of cotton ginning as a 'public business,' and provide that the Corporation Commission 'shall have the same power and authority and be charged with the duty of regulating and controlling such cotton gins in all matters relating to the performance of public duties and the charges therefor and correcting abuses and preventing unjust discrimination and extortion, as is exercised by said Commission as to transportation and transmission companies and shall have the same power to fix rates, rules, charges and regulations to be observed by such person or persons or corporation operating gins and the affording of all reasonable conveniences, facilities and services as it may impose as to transportation or transmission companies.' Com- \n\n[281 U.S. 431, 437]\n\u00a0\n piled Statutes of Oklahoma of 1921,  3712, as amended by Laws 1929 (Sp. Sess.) c. 240, and section 3715, as amended by Laws 1923, c. 191,  3. Under this authority, the Corporation Commission establishes rates and charges for the ginning of seed cotton, and it is agreed that these rates are applicable to all engaged in the cotton ginning business for the general public. There is no basis for an assumption that there will be any difference in rates and charges as applied to the appellee and the appellant company for similar services.\n With respect to the distribution of net earnings, the Corporation Commission and the appellant company have argued 'that there is no law in the State of Oklahoma against rebates,' and, further, that the so-called 'patronage dividend,' or a ratable distribution of net earnings to patrons upon the basis of their purchases and sales, as contemplated by the statute in question, 'is not a rebate as embraced within any definition of the word as heretofore used.' Apart from terminology, the important point is whether, under the law of Oklahoma, appellee may do in his business what the appellant is permitted to do, in distributing net earnings. The appellants, both the Corporation Commission and the company, say that he may.\n The question was distinctly raised upon the oral argument of the present case before this Court. Nor only was the appellee unable to bring to our attention any provision of the law of the state, or any regulation of the Corporation Commission, denying to the appellee the privilege of distributing net earnings to his patrons upon the basis of purchases and sales in a manner similar to that provided in the statute relating to the appellant company, but the counsel for the Corporation Commission in response to direct inquiry stated to the Court that he knew of no such provision of law or regulation of the \n\n[281 U.S. 431, 438]\n\u00a0\n Corporation Commission. See Clark v. Poor, \n271 \nU.S. 554, 557\n, 558 S., 47 S. Ct. 702\n\n\n It was incumbent upon the appellee in invoking the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment to show with convincing clarity that the law of the state created against him the discrimination of which he complained. An infraction of the constitutional provision is not to be assumed. On the contrary, it is to be presumed that the state in enforcing its local policies will conform its requirements to the Federal guaranties. Doubts on this point are to be resolved in favor of, and not against, the state. Grenada County Supervisors v. Brogden, \n112 \nU.S. 261, 269\n, 5 S. Ct. 125; St. Louis Southwestern Railway Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 369\n, 35 S. Ct. 99; Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 621\n, 35 S. Ct. 140; Pullman Co. v. Richardson, \n261 \nU.S. 330, 340\n, 43 S. Ct. 366; South Utah Mines v. Beaver County, \n262 \nU.S. 325, 331\n, 43 S. Ct. 577.\n In the present instance, the authority given to the appellant company by the statute with respect to the distribution of net earnings may be regarded as a declaration that such a distribution of net earnings among patrons of cotton gins is not contrary to, but in accord with, the policy of the state, and, until the contrary appears, the assumption must be that, in giving effect to its policy, the state will not permit an injurious and unreasonable discrimination. If, hereafter, in the regulation of his business, the appellee is subject to such a discrimination in violation of his constitutional rights, he will have his appropriate remedy.\n The decree of the District Court is reversed, and the cause remanded, with direction to dismiss the bill of complaint.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCROOKS v. HARRELSON(1930)\nNo. 24\nArgued: October 31, 1930Decided: November 24, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 55, 56]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Providence, R. I., Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Frank S. Bright, of Washington, D. C., and S. L. Swarts, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Benjamin H. Harrelson, a resident of Missouri, died testate in 1920, leaving within the state property and assets which included real property valued at over $269,000. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, upon \n\n[282 U.S. 55, 57]\n\u00a0\n a final audit and review of the federal estate tax return of the executors made under the Revenue Act of 1918, included the real property as a part of the gross estate for the purpose of computing the tax. The executors paid $37,762.20, the amount attributable to the value of the real property, and subsequently claimed a refund thereof on the ground that the value of the decedent's real property having its situs in Missouri was not, under the law of that state and the terms of the federal statute, properly subject to an estate tax, and the amount was therefore illegally assessed and collected. The estate having been closed and distributed and the executors discharged, plaintiffs (respondents here), as sole beneficiaries and distributees, brought this action in a federal district court against the defendant (petitioner here) to recover the amount so paid and claimed, together with interest. Defendant demurred to the complaint on the ground that the facts stated were not sufficient to constitute a caue o f action. The district court overruled the demurrer, and, defendant having declined to plead further, rendered judgment against him for the sum claimed, with interest and costs. 28 F.(2d) 510. Upon appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. 35 F.(2d) 416.\n A correct determination of the question presented requires consideration of the provisions of section 402 of the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1097, 1098, the relevant portion of which follows:\n'Sec. 402. That the value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated-\n\n'(a) To the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of his death which after his death is subject to the payment of the charges against his estate and the expenses of its administration and is subject to distribution as part of his estate.' \n\n[282 U.S. 55, 58]\n\u00a0\n The court below held: (1) That by the express provisions of the foregoing section, the value of the interest of a decedent in any property at the time of his death may not be included in the gross estate for the purpose of the tax unless there be a concurrence of the requirements there set forth, namely, (a) that the interest of the decedent be subject to the payment of the charges against his estate, (b) that such interest be subject to the expenses of administration, and (c) that such interest be subject to distribution as part of his estate; and (2) that by the law of Missouri such interest in real property is not subject to the expenses of administration, and, therefore, the requirement in that respect is not met. Both propositions are controverted by the petitioner.\n\n First. The meaning of the provision in question, considered by itself, does not seem to us to be doubtful. The value of the interest of the decedent is not to be included unless it 'is subject to the payment of the charges against his estate and the expenses of its administration'-not one or the other, but both. We find nothing in the context or in other provisions of the statute which warrants the conclusion that the word 'and' was used otherwise than in its ordinary sense; and to construe the clause as though it said, 'to the payment of charges and expenses, or either of them,' as petitioner seems to contend, would be to add a material element to the requirement, and thereby to create, not to expound, a provision of law. Nor will it do to say that the words, 'charges against his estate,' include expenses of administration, for plainly they are different and district things, generally so classified in the settlement of estates of decedents, and so regarded by Congress, as evidenced by the discriminating terms of the statute.\n A similar question was presented to this court and decided in United States v. Field, \n255 \nU.S. 257\n, 41 S. Ct. 256, 18 A. L. R. 1461. It was there held that the interest of the decedent, Mrs. Field, \n\n[282 U.S. 55, 59]\n\u00a0\n was not taxable under section 202(a) of the Revenue Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 777), re-enacted as clause (a) of section 402 now under review, because it was not her property at the time of her death, nor subject to distribution as part of her estate. The court said (page 262 of 255 U. S., 41 S. Ct. 256, 257):\n'The conditions expressed in clause (a) are to the effect that the taxable estate must be (1) an interest of the decedent at the time of his death, (2) which after his death is subject to the payment of the charges against his estate and the expenses of its administration, and (3) is subject to distribution as part of his estate. These conditions are expressed conjunctively; and it would be inadmissible, in construing a taxing act, to read them as if prescribed disjunctively. Hence, unless the appointed interest fulfilled all three conditions, it was not taxable under this clause.'\n\n It is to be observed that the court, by combining under one head the provision in respect of charges against the estate and that in respect of expense of administration, treated clause (a) as containing three conditions instead of four; but this does not alter the fact that, whether stated separately or in combination, the second condition contains two distinct requirements, expressed conjunctively, and may not be read as though stated disjunctively. It seems clear enough that the Field Case is decisive of the question and requires us to hold that, if the value of the interest of the decedent now being considered is not subject, under the law of Missouri, to the expenses of administration, it forms no part of the gross estate for the purpose of the federal estate tax.\n It is urged, however, that if the literal meaning of the statute be as indicated above, that meaning should be rejected as leading to absurd results, and a construction adopted in harmony with what is thought to be the spirit and purpose of the act in order to give effect to the intent of Congress. The principle sought to be applied is that \n\n[282 U.S. 55, 60]\n\u00a0\n followed by this court in Holy Trinity Church v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 457\n, 12 S. Ct. 511; but a consideration of what is there said will disclose that the principle is to be applied to override the literal terms of a statute only under rare and exceptional circumstances. The illustrative cases cited in the opinion demonstrate that, to justify a departure from the letter of the law upon that ground, the absurdity must be so gross as to shock the general moral or common sense. Compare Pirie v. Chicago Title & Trust Co., \n182 \nU.S. 438, 451\n, 452 S., 21 S. Ct. 906. And there must be something to make plain the intent of Congress that the letter of the statute is not to prevail. Treat v. White, \n181 \nU.S. 264, 268\n, 21 S. Ct. 611.\n Courts have sometimes exercised a high degree of ingenuity in the effort to find justification for wrenching from the words of a statute a meaning which literally they did not bear in order to escape consequences thought to be absurd or to entail great hardship. But an application of the principle so nearly approaches the boundary between the exercise of the judicial power and that of the legislative power as to call rather for great caution and circumspection in order to avoid usurpation of the latter. Monson v. Chester, 22 Pick. (Mass.) 385, 387. It is not enough merely that hard and objectionable or absurd consequences, which probably were not within the contemplation of the framers, are produced by an act of legislation. Laws enacted with good intention, when put to the test, frequently, and to the surprise of the lawmaker himself, turn out to be mischievous, absurd, or otherwise objectionable. But in such case the remedy lies with the lawmaking authority, and not with the courts. See In re Alma Spinning Company, L. R. 16 Ch. Div. 681, 686; King v. Commissioners, 5 A. & E. 804, 816; Abley v. Dale, L. J. (1851) N. S. Pt. 2, Vol. 20, 233, 235. And see generally Chung Fook v. White, \n264 \nU.S. 443, 445\n, 44 S. Ct. 361; Commissioner of Immigration v. Gottlieb, \n265 \nU.S. 310, 313\n, 44 S. Ct. 528. \n\n[282 U.S. 55, 61]\n\u00a0\n In support of the claim that a literal construction is not admissible, it is said that by other provisions of section 402 certain interests in real property, such as dower, etc., are made subject to the tax without regard to the conditions set forth in subdivision (a), and that this results in an incongruity amounting to an absurdity. But unless the Constitution be violated, Congress may select the subjects of taxation and qualify them differently as it sees fit; and if it does so in plain terms, as it has done here, it is not within the province of the court to modify the law by construction. In any event, conceding that the conditions assailed have produced the incongruous results complained of, they fall far short of that degree of absurdity contemplated by the Holy Trinity Church Case, or by any other decision of this court.\n Finally, the fact must not be overlooked that we are here concerned with a taxing act, with regard to whichthe general rule requiring adherence to the letter applies with peculiar strictness. In United States v. Merriam, \n263 \nU.S. 179, 187\n, 188 S., 44 S. Ct. 69, 71, 29 A. L. R. 1547, after saying that 'in statutes levying taxes the literal meaning of the words employed is most important for such statutes are not to be extended by implication beyond the clear import of the language used,' we quoted with approval the words of Lord Cairns in Partington v. Attorney-General, L. R. 4 H. L. 100, 122, that 'if the crown, seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law, the subject is free, however apparently within the spirit of the law the case might otherwise appear to be. In other words, if there be admissible in any statute what is called an equitable construction, certainly such a construction is not admissible in a taxing statute, where you can simply adhere to the words of the statute.'\n Second. It is conceded by the petitioner, as it must be, that at common law real estate cannot be sold to pay expenses of administration, and that this rule of the common law is in effect in Missouri unless modified by statute. \n\n[282 U.S. 55, 62]\n\u00a0\n It is further conceded that there is no statute which permits real estate to be sold merely to pay such expenses. One contention, however, is that an executor or administrator may be authorized by the proper court to sell real estate to pay debts and legacies if the personal estate is insufficient; and that upon such sale the executor or administrator is entitled to a commission on the proceeds of the sale, which takes priority over the payment of debts against the estate. As to this it is sufficient to say, as the court below said, that this commission is not an expense of administration, but an expense incidental to the sale of the lands. The Missouri Court of Appeals, in Elstroth v. Young, 94 Mo. App. 351, 355, 356, 68 S. W. 100, held that the proceeds of the sale of lands so made could not be used to make good deficiencies in the expenses of administration.\n The further contention that, if the personal estate has been consumed by administration expenses and real estate is sold to pay debts and legacies, as a practical matter, real estate has been sold because of administration expenses, we put aside as inconsequential. In the case supposed it is perfectly evident that the real estate has been sold, not to pay administration expenses, but to pay debts and legacies, and that fact is in no wise altered because the sale was necessistated by the consumption of the personalty for such expenses. The cause of the sale must not be confused with its purpose.\n Nothing would be gained by a review of the numerous decisions of the Missouri courts. They are set forth and fully and well considered by the court below, and we entirely agree with that court's conclusion that these decisions establish 'that real estate of a decedent in that state cannot be sold for the payment of expenses of administration, nor can the proceeds of land sold to pay debts be lawfully used to pay expenses of administration.' \n\n[282 U.S. 55, 63]\n\u00a0\n We have not failed to note the decision of the Court of Claims in Steedman v. United States, 63 Ct. Cl. 226, as well as the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals in Bartlett v. Commissioner, 16 B. T. A. 811, 816, but, in so far as they conflict with the foregoing conclusions, they are disapproved.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDANOVITZ v. UNITED STATES(1930)\nNo. 424\nArgued: April 23, 1930Decided: May 5, 1930\n\n\n\n Messrs. Ward Bonsall and John W. Dunkle, both of Pettsburgh, Pa ., for petitioner.\n\n\n[281 U.S. 389, 392]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Charles P. Sisson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n[281 U.S. 389, 395]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a libel of the forfeiture of alleged contraband liquors, property and material designed for the manufacture of contraband liquors, specifically described, and alleged to have been unlawfully held in violation of section 23, tit. 2, of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA  39). The District Court found that the allegations of fact contained in the libel were sustained and ordered a decree of forfeiture. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 34 F.(2d) 30. A writ of certiorari was granted \n\n[281 U.S. 389, 396]\n\u00a0\n by this Court but confined to the single question whether the property seized is forfeitable under section 25, tit. 2, of the National Prohibition Act (27 USCA  39). \n280 \nU.S. 548\n, 50 S. Ct. 69, 74 L. Ed. -.\n The property in question was containers, barrels, bottles, corks, labels, cartons, etc. By the statute it is 'unlawful to have or possess any liquor or property designed for the manufacture of liquor intended for use in violating this chapter or which has been so used, and no property rights shall exist in any such liquor or property.' A search warrant may issue 'and such liquor, the containers thereof, and such property so seized shall be subject to such disposition as the court may make thereof. If it is found that such liquor or property was so unlawfully held or possessed, or had been so unlawfully used, the liquor, and all property designed for the unlawful manufacture of liquor, shall be destroyed, unless the court shall otherwise order.' Act of October 28, 1919, c. 85, tit. 2,  25, 41 Stat. 305, 315, U. S. Code, tit. 27,  39 (27 USCA  39). The argument for the petitioner, so far as it does not go beyond the limits set in granting the writ of certiorari, is that empty containers, bottles and the other apparatus described, cannot be used in or designed for the manufacture of liquor, because the manufacture is completed before that apparatus comes into play. There is a further argument that the containers were not designed in fact for the manufacture of liquor even if they could be, but the objection to this is that if the terms in which the writ was granted do not exclude it, the case having been tried without written waiver of jury, the sufficiency and effect of evidence are not open. Commissioner of Road District No. 2 v. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co ., \n257 \nU.S. 547, 562\n, 42 S. Ct. 250.\n The argument for the petitioner cannot be helped by amplification. It is obviously correct if the word 'manufacture' be taken in the strictest and most exact sense. But the word may be used in a looser way to express the whole process by which an article is made \n\n[281 U.S. 389, 397]\n\u00a0\n ready for sale on the open market. P. Lorrilard Co. v. Ross, 183 Ky. 217, 223, 209 S. W. 39. As the purpose of the Prohibition Act was to 'suppress the entire traffic' condemned by the act, United States v. Katz, \n271 \nU.S. 354, 357\n, 46 S. Ct. 513; Donnelley v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 505, 513\n, 48 S. Ct. 400, it should be liberally construed to the end of this suppression, and so directs. Title 2,  3, of the Act, Code, title 27,  12 (27 USCA  12). The decisions under the revenue acts have little weight as against legislation under the afflatus of the Eighteenth Amendment. We are of opinion that the word was used in this looser way, and that if the empty containers and the other objects seized were offered for sale in such a mode as purposely to attract purchasers who wanted them for the unlawful manufacture, as we interpret the word, they were designed for that manufacture and could be seized.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","37":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIS v. PRESTON(1930)\nNo. 188\nArgued: January 23, 1930Decided: February 24, 1930\n\n\n\n Messrs. W. L. Cook, of Houston, Tex., and Sidney F. Andrews, of Washington, D. C., for petitioners. \n\n[280 U.S. 406, 407]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert L. Cole, of Houston, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This proceeding relates to an action brought in a state court of Texas to recover for the death of a railroad employee occurring during federal control-while the railroad was being operated by the Director General. The action was begun by the deceased's widow, in her personal right, against Walker D. Hines, as Director General; but by amendments and substitutions the action came to be one prosecuted under the Federal Employers' Act of 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 (45 USCA  51-59) by the widow, as administratrix of the deceased's estate, against James C. Davis, as Federal Agent. Judgment went against the latter, and on successive appeals there was an affirmance by the Court of Civil Appeals, 264 S. W. 331, and the Supreme Court of the state, 16 S.W.(2d) 117. The final affirmance included a provision adjudging the corporate surety on the appeal bond jointly liable with Davis, as Federal Agent, for the costs in the two appellate courts.\n Within the allotted three months, Davis describing himself as Federal Agent, and the surety company petitioned this Court for a review on certiorari, and the petition was granted.\n It now appears that when the petition was presented Davis had ceased to be Federal Agent, and had been succeeded in that office by Andrew W. Mellon-thereby making the judgment unenforceable against Davis and possible of satisfaction only after the substitution of his successor, Mellon. Therefore Davis was not then in a position to complain of the judgment or to invoke a review of it by this Court. All right and discretion to do either had passed to his successor in office. Florida ex \n\n[280 U.S. 406, 408]\n\u00a0\n rel. Wailes v. Croom, \n226 \nU.S. 309\n, 33 S. Ct. 109; Taylor v. Savage, 1 How. 282, 286; Dolan v. Jennings, \n139 \nU.S. 385, 387\n, 11 S. Ct. 584; McClane v. Boon, 6 Wall. 244.\n It follows that the writ of certiorari granted on the petition of Davis (\n280 \nU.S. 540\n, 50 S. Ct. 26, 74 L. Ed. -) was improvidently allowed and must be dismissed. The fact that the surety company joined in the petition cannot alter the result. While the company was adjudged liable for the costs in the two appellate courts, that feature of the judgment of affirmance is not made a ground of complaint. Nor does it enable the company to complain of the judgment in other particulars. Smith v. Indiana, \n191 U.S. 138\n, 149-150, 24 S. Ct. 51.\n A motion is now made by Andrew W. Mellon, as Federal Agent, for his substitution in the present proceeding in the place of Davis. But the motion must be denied. The succession in office, as now appears, occurred before there was any effort to obtain a review in this Court. After the succession, Davis was completely separated from the office and without right to invoke such a review or exercise any authority or discretion in that regard. Therefore his petition must be disregarded. The time within which such a review may be invoked is limited by statute, and that time has long since expired. To grant the motion in these circumstances would be to put aside the statutory limitation and to subject the party prevailing in the state court to uncertainty and vexation which the limitation is intended to prevent.\n The provisions relating to substitution which were added to section 206 of the Transportation Act of 1920 by the Act of March 3, 1923, c. 233, 42 Stat. 1443 (49 USCA  74) are cited in support of the motion. But, even when they are liberally construed, as they probably should be, they disclose no purpose either (a) to enable a former Federal Agent to invoke a review by this Court of a judgment which is of no legal concern to him, or (b) to modify or \n\n[280 U.S. 406, 409]\n\u00a0\n enlarge the prescribed statutory period for invoking the reviewing power of this Court.\n Motion for substitution denied.\n Writ of certiorari dismissed. \n\n\n\n","38":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDE FOREST RADIO COMPANY v.

Code (1930), title 6, c. 9,  246, provides:\n'(a) No vehicle shall be operated upon any public highway in the District at a speed greater than twenty-two miles per hour except in such outlying districts and upon such highways as the director may designate. ...\n\n'(b) No individual shall operate a motor vehicle over any public highway in the District (1) recklessly; or (2) at a rate of speed greater than is reasonable and proper, having regard to the width of the public highway, the use thereof, and the traffic thereon; or (3) so as to endanger any property or individual; or (4) so as unnecessarily or unreasonably to damage the public highway.\n\n'(c) Any individual violating any provision of this section where the offense constitutes reckless driving shall, upon conviction for the first offense, be fined not less than $25 nor more than $100 or imprisoned not less than 10 days nor more than 30 days; and upon conviction for \n\n[282 U.S. 63, 72]\n\u00a0\n the second or any subsequent offense such individual shall be fined not less than $100 nor more than $1,000, and shall be imprisoned not less than 30 days nor more than one year, and the clerk of the court shall certify forthwith such conviction to the director, who shall thereupon revoke the operator's permit of such individual.\n\n'(d) Any individual violating any provision of this section except where the offense constitutes reckless driving, shall, upon conviction for the first offense, be fined not less than $5 nor more than $25; upon conviction for the second offense, such individual shall be fined not less than $25 nor more than $100; upon conviction for the third offense or any subsequent offense such individual shall be fined not less than $100 nor more than $500, and shall be imprisoned not less than 30 days nor more than one year, and the clerk of the court shall certify forthwith such conviction to the director, who shall thereupon revoke the operator's permit of such individual.'\n\n It will be seen that the respondent is not charged merely with the comparatively slight offense of exceeding the twenty-two mile limit of speed, subdivision (a), or merely with driving recklessly, subdivision (b)( 1); but with the grave offense of having driven at the forbidden rate of speed and recklessly, 'so as to endanger property and individuals.'\n By section 165 of title 18 of the D. C. Code, outlined above, the Constitution is made the test-as, of course, it must be-to determine whether the accused be entitled to a jury trial. Article 3,  2, cl. 3, of the Constitution provides that, 'The Trial of all Crimes, exceptin Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury.' This provision is to be interpreted in the light of the common law, according to which petty offenses might be proceeded against summarily before a magistrate sitting without a jury. See Callan v. Wilson, \n127 \nU.S. 540, 557\n, 8 S. Ct. 1301. That there may be many offenses called 'petty offenses' which do not rise to the \n\n[282 U.S. 63, 73]\n\u00a0\n degree of crimes within the meaning of article 3, and in respect of which Congress may dispense with a jury trial, is settled. Schick v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 65\n, 24 S. Ct. 826, 1 Ann. Cas. 585. And see Natal v. Louisiana, \n139 \nU.S. 621, 624\n, 11 S. Ct. 636; Lawton v. Steele, \n152 \nU.S. 133, 141\n, 14 S. Ct. 499; State v. Rodgers, 91 N. J. Law, 212, 214, 102 A. 433.\n Whether a given offense is to be classed as a crime, so as to require a jury trial, or as a petty offense, triable summarily without a jury, depends primarily upon the nature of the offense. The offense here charged is not merely malum prohibitum, but in its very nature is malum in se. It was an indictable offense at common law, United States v. John Hart, Pet. C. C. 390, 392, Fed. Cas. No. 15, 316, when horses, instead of gasoline, constituted the motive power. The New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals, in State v. Rodgers, supra, has discussed the distinction between traffic offenses of a petty character, subject to summary proceedings without indictment and trial by jury, and those of a serious character, amounting to public nuisances indictable at common law; and its examination of the subject makes clear that the offense now under review is of the latter character.\n An automobile is, potentially, a dangerous instrumentality, as the appalling number of fatalities brought about every day by its operation bear distressing witness. To drive such an instrumentality through the public streets of a city so recklessly 'as to endanger property and individuals' is an act of such obvious depravity that to characterize it as a petty offense would be to shock the general moral sense. If the act of the respondent described in the information had culminated in the death of a human being, respondent would have been subject to indictment for some degree of felonious homicide. Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 377\n, 33 S. Ct. 780; 1 Whar, Cr. Law,  343 et seq., 353- 356; 1 Bish, New Cr. Law,  313 et seq.; Story v. United States, 57 App. D. C. 3, 16 F.(2d) 342, 344, 53 A.

Such an act properly cannot be described otherwise than as a grave offense-a crime within the meaning of the third article of the Constitution-and as such within the constitutional guarantee of trial by jury.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA v. FRED(1930)\nNo. 229\nArgued: January 24, 1930Decided: February 24, 1930\n\n\n\n Messrs. Richmond B. Keech and William W. Bride, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. S. McComas Hawken, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent was convicted in the police court of the District of Columbia of the offense of operating a motor vehicle in the District during the unexpired period of his operator's permit after it had been revoked. Section 13(d) of the Traffic Acts of the District of Columbia, Act of March \n\n[281 U.S. 49, 50]\n\u00a0\n 3, 1925, 43 Stat. 1119, 1125, as amended by Act of July 3, 1926, 44 Stat. pt. 2, p. 812. The Court of Appeals of the District, on writ of error, set aside the conviction. 33 F.(2d) 375. This Court granted certiorari May 27, 1929, to review its judgment (\n280 \nU.S. 541\n, 50 S. Ct. 29, 74 L. Ed. -).\n Section 13(d) provides: 'Any individual found guilty of operating a motor vehicle in the District during the period for which his operator's permit is revoked or suspended, or for which his right to operate is suspended under this Act shall, for each such offense, be fined not less than $100 nor more than $500, or imprisoned not less than 30 days nor more than one year, or both.' The facts, proved at the trial, showed an unquestioned violation of this section by respondent, unless, as contended, his possession of a Virginia operator's permit or license, aided by the reciprocity provisions of the District Traffic Acts, exempts him from its operation.\n Following the revocation of his District of Columbia permit, respondent, who was then a resident of the District, took up his residence in Virginia, and procured from that state a motor vehicle registration card and automobile license tags, authorizing him to operate his motor car in Virginia. The alleged violation of  13(d) occurred while his Virginia registration license was in force and while respondent was temporarily in the District, driving his automobile equipped with the Virginia license tags.\n By section 7, all persons operating motorcars within the District are required to have an operator's permit, which permit, under section 13(a), may be suspended or revoked by the Director of Traffic for cause. By section 7(e) operation of a motor vehicle without a permit is punishable by fine of 'not more than $500 or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.' But by section 8(a) the requirement of an operator's permit is dispensed with in favor of nonresidents who have procured a permit or license \n\n[281 U.S. 49, 51]\n\u00a0\n from a state granting like exemptions to residents of the District, as has the state of Virginia. The language of the exemption is: 'Shall be exempt from compliance with  7 and with provisions of law or regulations requiring the registration of motor vehicles or the display of identification tags in the District.'\n The court below, in setting aside the conviction, rested its decision on the ground that this provision 'expressly relieves the nonresident owner or operator of a motor vehicle, who has complied with the laws of his state respecting registration and operators' licenses, from either registering his vehicle here or obtaining a local operator's permit, provided only that similar privileges are extended to residents of the District in that state.' But respondent was not charged with violation of section 7, which forbids operating without a license, or of any provision or regulation requiring the registration of motor vehicles, which are the only offenses exempted under section 8. He was charged with a different offense, under section 13(d), that of operating a vehicle within a specified time after the revocation of his permit, for which a different penalty is provided than for violations of section 7. It is significant that the exemption clause in section 8(a) specifically refers to section 7, but makes no mention of section 13(d).\n If the clause were ambiguous, or there were any room for construing it, examination of the whole act makes evident its general purpose not to extend to nonresidents any reciprocal privilege beyond relieving them from the necessity of procuring a District operator's license and complying with provisions for the registration of their vehicles, and that all other requirements of the act and penalties for noncompliance were left in full force and effect. By section 13(c) the right to operate a car in the District under the license or permit of a state may be suspended, and operation of the car in the District during the period of suspension is punishable under section 13(d). \n\n[281 U.S. 49, 52]\n\u00a0\n It cannot be supposed that any distinction was intended to be drawn between the consequences of operating a car within the District by one whose right to operate under a foreign license had been suspended and one whose right to operate under a District license had been revoked or suspended. We can find nothing in the sections cited or the Traffic Acts as a whole to suggest that there is.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","41":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA v. THOMPSON(1930)\nNo. 44\nArgued: December 4, 1929Decided: February 24, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 25, 26]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alexander H. Bell, Jr., and William W. Bride, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Wm. E. Furey and Paul V. Rogers, both of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 25, 28]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Pursuant to an Act of March 1, 1912,1 authorizing and directing them so to do, the Commissioners of the District of Columbia instituted in the Supreme Court of the District, under and in accordance with the District Code of Law, a proceeding in rem to condemn the land necessary to extend Lamont Street, northwest, with a width of ninety feet, through two designated squares west of its termination at 19th Street. \n2\n The strip of land necessary for this extension was condemned and title vested in the District, and the damages were awarded and the benefits assessed by a verdict of the jury. This was confirmed by the court in February, 1913. The sum of $200 was assessed as benefits against a lot owned by the respondent, Georgiana Thompson. Under the District Code this became a lien upon the lot, collectible as special improvement taxes and payable in five annual instalments. \n3\n In March, 1921, the lot was sold for nonpayment of the assessment, and in March, 1923, was redeemed by the respondent from such sale by the payment of the $200 and interest to the Collector of Taxes of the District.\n In June, 1927, the respondent-hereinafter called the plaintiff- brought an action against the District in the Municipal Court, alleging that she had paid the assessment of benefits under obligation of law; that the District had wholly failed to extend Lamont Street through the \n\n[281 U.S. 25, 29]\n\u00a0\n designated squares, the strip of land condemned being yet unimproved by a street extension, and had abandoned the purpose of the condemnation authorized by the Act of Congress; and that she was entitled to the repayment of the $200 assessment-for which she claimed judgment. The District filed a plea to the jurisdiction of the court over the cause of action; and also an affidavit of defense, denying that it had abandoned the purpose of the condemnation for the extension of Lamont Street, and alleging that more than three years had elapsed since the time when the plaintiff's right of action, if any, had accrued to her. It was not alleged that the District intended to extend Lamont Street over the condemned strip at any future time.\n At the trial the following facts-which are undisputed-were shown: Lamont Street, when the condemnation proceeding for its extension was instituted, had been paved, graded and laid out, east of 19th Street, with a roadway, sidewalks, curbing and parking spaces, and was open for vehicle and pedestrian traffic. Since the acquisition of the strip west of 19th Street and the confirmation of the verdict in 1913, no official action had been taken by the Commissioners or by Congress looking to the abandonment of the title thereto, or of the right of the District to improve it. However, since that time and up to the filing of the plaintiff's suit in 1927, Lamont Street had not been extended as an improved street, and the condemned strip had not been laid out for a roadway, sidewalk or parking space, nor graded, paved or otherwise improved for highway purposes; nor had Congress made any specific appropriation therefor. And although lying between two improved highways, 19th Street and Adams Mill Road, it still remained open, vacant property. For a short distance along its south side, at a time not shown, a cement sidewalk had been laid by a private person as an entrance to an apartment house, under a District per- \n\n[281 U.S. 25, 30]\n\u00a0\n mit. In March, 1924, the District had laid a cement sidewalk and curb along the west side of 19th Street and across the east end of the condemned strip, which constituted an effective obstruction to any vehicular traffic over it. And in January, 1926, in a letter declining to entertain an application made by the attorney for the plaintiff and others for a refund of the assessments on the ground that the District appeared to have abandoned the project for the extension of the street, the Auditor of the District had stated that the official files of the engineer department indicated that it had never been the intention to open the extension of Lamont Street to vehicular traffic because of the excessive grade, but that the principal reason for condemning the strip was to provide a vista and access to Zoological Park, and it was intended to treat the extension with terraces and steps. \n4\n It was not shown that the District had taken any step at any time looking towards the extension of Lamont Street over the condemned strip, or indicating its intention to make such extension at any future time.\n The Municipal Court gave judgment for the plaintiff; and this, on writ of error, was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the District. 58 App. D. C. 313, 30 F.(2d) 476.\n We think the judgment should be affirmed.\n\n 1. \nPursuant to the Act of Congress the strip of land was condemned for the extension of Lamont Street, an improved thoroughfare open for vehicular and pedestrian traffic and all the ordinary uses of a street. In the condemnation proceeding the jury were necessarily required \n\n[281 U.S. 25, 31]\n\u00a0\n to assess the benefits which would accrue from such extension, that is, from the extension of a street where one had not theretofore existed, and not from an unimproved strip of land merely. See Washington R. & E. Co. v. Newman, 41 App. D. C. 439, 445; and cases cited. That is, the consideration for the assessment of the benefits was the extension of Lamont Street over the condemned strip.\n\n 2. \nUnder the undisputed facts we think the District was under an obligation imposed by law to return, as for a failure of consideration, the assessment of benefits that had been paid by the plaintiff.\n In Valentine v. City of St. Paul, 34 Minn. 446, 448, 26 N. W. 457, 458, benefits had been assessed against the plaintiff's land by reason of the proposed opening and extension of a street, and he had been compelled to pay the amount of this assessment to redeem his land from sale. No part of the street having been opened, and the project for opening and extending it having been abandoned by the city, he was held entitled to recover the amount paid as upon a failure of the consideration for the assessment. The court said that 'the effect of the abandonment by the city of the project of 'extending and opening' the proposed street for and on account of which, and which only, the assessment was made, is that the consideration of the assessment has wholly failed. So that the city stands in the position of holding in its treasury money collected from the plaintiff which it has no right in equity, good conscience, or common honesty to retain, because the purpose for which it was collected has been completely abandoned. In such circumstances no statute is required to impose upon the city a legal obligation to make restitution. An action lies as at common law for money had and received. ... That the city is a municipal corporation does not distinguish it from a private person in this respect.' To the same effect are McConville v. City of St. \n\n[281 U.S. 25, 32]\n\u00a0\n Paul, 75 Minn. 383, 77 N. W. 993, 43 L. R. A. 584, 74 Am. St. Rep. 508; City of San Antonio v. Peters (Tex. Civ. App.) 40 S. W. 827; City of San Antonio v. Walker (Tex. Civ. App.) 56 S. W. 952, and Bradford v. City of Chicago, 25 Ill. 411, involving assessments for the opening, extension and widening of streets. And see Ward v. Board of County Com'rs of Love County, \n253 \nU.S. 17, 24\n, 40 S. Ct. 419, and cases cited.\n In two of these cases the abandonment of the proposed street improvement for which the benefits had been assessed, although not shown by any affirmative act on the part of the municipality, was established by circumstances; in one where there had been the lapse of a reasonable time during which the city had done nothing to carry on the improvement, and there was no claim in its answer or proof that it desired or ever intended so to do, McConville v. City of St. Paul, supra, 386 of 75 Minn., 77 N. W. 993, 43 L. R. A. 584, 74 Am. St. Rep. 508; and in the other where there had been the lapse of a reasonable time during which the city had done nothing to carry out the improvement, and there was no proof that it had been prevented by any obstacle in the way thereof, Bradford v. City of Chicago, supra, 417 of 25 Ill.\n Here, although the Commissioners had been instructed by Congress to condemn the strip of land for the extension of Lamont Street, more than fourteen years had elapsed during which the District had neither made this extension nor taken any step towards that end; it showed no obstacle which had prevented such extension; it had built a sidewalk and curb across the strip which constituted an obstruction to vehicular traffic; and it made no claim in its pleadings or proof that it desired or intended to make such extension at any future time. We think that these circumstances established, as a matter of reasonable and necessary inference, the fact that the District had abandoned the purpose of extending the street over the condemned strip; and that, this being so, for \n\n[281 U.S. 25, 33]\n\u00a0\n the reasons well stated in the Valentine Case, the District was properly required to return to the plaintiff, as for failure of consideration, the amount of the assessment that she had paid, which it had retained contrary to equity and good conscience and held, by implication of law, as money had and received to her use.\n\n 3. \nAs the basis of the plaintiff's cause of action was the obligation imposed by law upon the District by reason of the failure of consideration for the assessment of benefits, it was one, we think, of which the Municipal Court had jurisdiction as a claim for debt arising out of an 'implied' contract, not exceeding $300.5\n\n 4. \nNor was the plaintiff's right of action barred by the statute of limitations of three years. \n6\n The District contends that the plaintiff's claim accrued either when the verdict of the jury assessing benefits was confirmed in February, 1913, or when she paid the assessment in March, 1923. This contention entirely misconceives the nature of the plaintiff's cause of action, which is not based upon any illegality in the original assessment that would have given rise to any right of action when the benefits were either assessed or paid, but entirely upon the abandonment by the District of the proposed extension. See City of San Antonio v. Walker, supra, 953 of 56 S. W. The Court of Appeals held upon the evidence that such right of action did not accrue until January, 1926; and this is not controverted.\n The judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 37 Stat. 71, c. 48. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The act specifically provided that the amount awarded by the jury as damages for the land condemned for the extension, plus the costs and expenses of the proceeding, should be assessed by the jury as benefits. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] District Code of Law,  491j. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] This letter was introduced by the plaintiff and admitted over the defendant's objection, to show her first knowledge that the defendant intended to abandon or had abandoned the purpose of the condemnation; but the defendant's exception to the overruling of its objection was not brought up by any assignment of error in the Court of Appeals. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] District Code,  9; Act of Feb. 17, 1909, 35 Stat. 623, c. 134. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] District Code,  1265. \n\n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDOHANY v.

Brucker, both of Lansing, Mich., and H. R. Martin, of Detroit, Mich., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380) from a decree of a District Court of three judges, for the Eastern \n\n[281 U.S. 362, 364]\n\u00a0\n District of Michigan, dismissing appellant's complaint. The suit was brought to enjoin the state highway commissioner and others from acquiring a right of way for railway use, across land of the appellant, and from prosecuting a proceeding in the state courts for the acquisition of the right of way, by condemnation, on the ground that the state statutes under which the proceeding was had infringed the State Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.\n The state highway commissioner is engaged in carrying out a project for the construction and widening of a state highway between Detroit and Pontiac, Mich., which for several miles adjoins the right of way of the respondent Detroit, Grand Haven & Milwaukee Railway Company. As a part of the project, it is proposed to include in the highway the adjacent railroad right of way. This is to be acquired by relocating the railway on lands to be taken in the pending condemnation Proceedings, and exchanged for the present right of way. As authorized by No. 215 of the Michigan Public Acts of 1925 and No. 340 of the Acts of 1927, the commissioner has entered into a contract with the railroad company for the proposed exchange, to be effected when the commissioner has acquired, by purchase or eminent domain, the lands on which the railroad is to be relocated. Acting under No. 352 of the Michigan Public Acts of 1925, as amended by No. 92 of the Acts of 1927, the commissioner has begun, in the probate court of Oakland county, the proceeding which the appellant seeks to enjoin in the present suit.\n In proceedings brought under the act last mentioned, commissioners appointed by the court fix the compensation for lands taken, after a hearing, and are required to assess the benefits accruing to landowners by reason of the establishment of the highway. Review may be had by certiorari. Proceedings brought by incorporated rail- \n\n[281 U.S. 362, 365]\n\u00a0\n way companies for condemnation of property for railway use, so far as relevant to the present inquiry, are governed by other statutes. Railway Condemnation Statutes,  8249-8257, Michigan Comp. Laws 1915. Under them the landowner, it is contended, is accorded rights or privileges withheld from him by the Highway Condemnation Act. They are (a) the right to possession of his property until damages have been finally assessed and paid; (b) the right to consequential damages for diminution in value of any part of the tract not taken; (c) the right to damages without deduction of benefits accruing from the construction of the railroad; (d) the right to attorney's fees and expenses in addition to damages; (e) the right to trial by jury; and (f) the right to review by appeal instead of by certiorari. Other differences are of less importance.\n All questions of the propriety, under the State Constitution and laws, of condemning plaintiff's land in the pending proceeding, rather than under the Railroad Condemnation Law, have been resolved in respondent's favor by the Michigan Supreme Court in other suits, which involved lands taken for the same project under the same contract and by like procedure. Fitzsimons & Galvin, Inc., v. Rogers, 243 Mich. 649, 220 N. W. 881; Johnstone et al. v. Detroit, Grand Haven & Milwaukee Ry. Co., 245 Mich. 65, 222 N. W. 325. Accepting this interpretation of the local law by the highest court of the state, Rindge Co. v. Los Angeles County, \n262 \nU.S. 700, 708\n, 43 S. Ct. 689, we restrict our inquiry to the questions raised under the Federal Constitution.\n The appellant contends that the taking of his land for the purpose of exchange with the railway company is for a private and not a public purpose (see Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Nebraska, \n164 \nU.S. 403, 417\n, 17 S. Ct. 130), and that the statute which authorizes the condemnation of his property by a proceeding under the Highway Act, when it is to be devoted to railway use, deprives him of the special advan- \n\n[281 U.S. 362, 366]\n\u00a0\n tages named which are accorded to landowners whose property is taken under the Railway Condemnation Statutes, and so denies to him due process of law and the equal protection of the laws.\n We need not inquire whether, under the peculiar provisions of the Michigan statutes, the proposed taking of appellant's land is for highway or railway purposes. It is enough that, although the land is to be used as a right of way for a railroad, its acquisition is so essentially a part of the project for improving a public highway as to be for a public use. See Brown v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 78\n, 44 S. Ct. 92; Pitznogle v. Western Md. R. Co., 119 Md. 673, 87 A. 917, 46 L. R. A. (N. S .) 319; Rogers v. Bradshaw, 20 Johns. (N. Y.) 735. Nor is the requirement of the Highway Act that the appellant surrender possession of the property before payment of compensation in itself a denial of due process, so long as the payment of the award is insured, which is not questioned here. Section 20, Act No. 352 of 1925; Backus v. Ft. Street Union Depot Co., \n169 \nU.S. 557, 568\n, 18 S. Ct. 445; Joslin Mfg. Co. v. City of Providence, \n262 \nU.S. 668\n, 43 S. Ct. 684; Rindge Co. v. Los Angeles County, supra. In other respects the advantages of proceeding under the Railway Condemnation Act, alleged to be withheld from appellant, fall into two classes, those which affect the measure of his recovery and those which relate to details of procedure.\n The right to just compensation to which appellant is entitled under the due process clause, without regard to the particular procedure employed, is guaranteed both by the Fourteenth Amendment and article 13 of the Michigan Constitution. We cannot assume that, under the procedure prescribed by the state for the taking of appellant's land, he will not be entitled to receive or will in fact be denied the just compensation which the Constitution guarantees.\n On the contrary, the Supreme Court of Michigan has explicitly pointed out that the procedure and statutes \n\n[281 U.S. 362, 367]\n\u00a0\n presently involved not only insure just compensation in the constitutional sense, but allow the full measure of compensation for the taking provided by the Railway Act. In addition, it is emphasized that, even though the land be taken under the Highway Act, that act, like the Railway Act, does not permit the offset of benefits arising from railroad construction against damages for the taking, since it only permits deduction of benefits derived from the construction of a highway. Fitzsimons & Galvin, Inc., v. Rogers, supra, 243 Mich. 664, 220 N. W. 881.1 See Johnstone et al. v. \n\n[281 U.S. 362, 368]\n\u00a0\n Detroit, Grand Haven & Milwaukee Ry. Co., supra, 245 Mich. 68, 222 N. W. 325; In re Widening of Bagley Avenue, 248 Mich. 1, 226 N. W. 688; In re Widening of Fulton Street, 248 Mich. 13, 226 N. W. 690.\n As thus construed, the Michigan statutes afford no basis for anticipating that, in the pending proceeding, just compensation will be denied, or that any advantages given by the provisions of the Railway Act with respect to the amount of compensation for the land taken or the deduction of benefits will be withheld from appellant. Hence it is unnecessary to say, in response to the contention pressed upon us, how far these advantages if not secured to appellant by the Highway Act or embraced within just compensation are conferred upon him by constitutional guaranties. See McCoy v. Union Elevated Railroad Co., \n247 \nU.S. 354\n, 38 S. Ct. 504; Bauman v. Ross, \n167 \nU.S. 548\n, 17 S. Ct. 966.\n Attorneys' fees and expenses are not embraced within just compensation for land taken by eminent domain. See Joslin Mfg. Co. v. City of Providence, supra, \n262 \nU.S. 675\n, 43 S. Ct. 684. A state may allow the recovery of an attorney's fee in special classes of proceedings while withholding them in others. People of Sioux County v. National Surety Co., \n276 \nU.S. 238\n, 48 S. Ct. 239; C. & N. W. Ry. Co. v. Nye, etc., Co., \n260 \nU.S. 35\n, 43 S. Ct. 55; Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. v. Cade, \n233 \nU.S. 642\n, 34 S. Ct. 678; Farmers', etc., Ins. Co. v. Dobney, \n189 \nU.S. 301\n, 23 S. Ct. 565. In condemnation proceedings it may classify those whose property is taken and allow the one class expenses not granted to another. Joslin Mfg. Co. v. City of Providence, supra, \n262 \nU.S. 675\n, 43 S. Ct. 684. Since a permitted classification of those upon whom liability for attorneys' fees is imposed involves the denial of their recovery to some, appellant cannot object here to a classification allowing attorneys' fees in condemnation proceedings brought by railroad companies and denying them when brought by the state. If the classification is valid, he cannot complain; if invalid, \n\n[281 U.S. 362, 369]\n\u00a0\n the fees denied to him under the Highway Act could not have been recovered under the Railway Act.\n The due process clause does not guarantee to the citizen of a state any particular form or method of state procedure. Under it he may neither claim a right to trial by jury nor a right of appeal. Its requirements are satisfied if he has reasonable notice and reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present his claim or defense; due regard being had to the nature of the proceeding and the character of the rights which may be affected by it. Reetz v. Michigan, \n188 \nU.S. 505, 508\n, 23 S. Ct. 390; Hurwitz v. North, \n271 \nU.S. 40\n, 46 S. Ct. 384; Bauman v. Ross, \n167 \nU.S. 548, 593\n, 17 S. Ct. 966; Backus v. Union Depot Co., supra, \n169 \nU.S. 569\n, 18 S. Ct. 445.\n Nor does the equal protection clause exact uniformity of procedure. The Legislature may classify litigation and adopt one type of procedure for one class and a different type for another. That condemnation proceedings under the Highway Act are conducted on behalf of the state is in itself sufficient basis for the exercise of the legislative judgment in providing for it a different procedure from that prescribed for the exercise of eminent domain by a private corporation. See Backus v. Union Depot Co., supra, \n169 \nU.S. 570\n, 18 S. Ct. 445.\n The decree dismissing the appellant's bill was attested by only one of the three judges who heard the case. The appellant contends that it 'does not purport to be authorized or sanctioned' by either of the other two judges. The decree on its face purports to be by the District Court sitting in the cause. It recites in terms that 'the court, ... being fully advised in the premises, do now here order, adjudge and decree, ...' and the record shows that the court referred to was made up of three judges, required by section 266 (28 USCA  380). Even if, as appellant assumes, this statement by one judge is not to be relied upon, there is ample authorization and sanction for the decree in the \n\n[281 U.S. 362, 370]\n\u00a0\n opinion signed by two of the judges and the concurring opinion of the third. This we think equivalent for that purpose to an announcement in open court, three judges sitting. See Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Louisiana Public Service Commission, \n260 U.S. 212\n, 218 43 S. Ct. 75.\n We have considered, but do not discuss, other contentions of appellant of less moment.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'It is true that the highway law of this state provides that, in fixing compensation, the benefits accruing to the property owner are offset against the damage awarded. See Act 352 (Pub. Acts) 1925,  18; In re Macomb County Board of County Road Com'rs, 242 Mich. 239, 219 N. E. 74. But it does not follow from this that, in a proceeding wherein the state highway commissioner is seeking to secure a right of way, the damage to be awarded the property owner will be anything short of the 'just compensation' provided in section 2 of art. 13 of the Constitution. In the present case, as in an ordinary proceeding for condemning a right of way for a railroad, it will be the duty of the commissioners 'to compensate the owner for what his landed interest will suffer from the use proposed to be made of it by the railroad company.' Barnes v. Railway Co., 65 Mich. 251, 32 N. W. 426. Adequate compensation is such only as puts the injured party in as good condition as he would have been in if the injury had not been inflicted. It includes the value of the land, or the amount to which the value of the property from which it is taken is depreciated. Grand Rapids, etc., R. Co., v. Heisel, 47 Mich. 393, 11 N. W. 212. There is no provision in our statutes for offsetting benefits against damages incident to taking land for a railroad right of way; and, in the absence of an express statutory provision, such a deduction cannot be made. Detroit, etc ., R. Co. v. National Bank, 196 Mich. 660, 163 N. W. 97; State Highway Commissioner v. Breisacher, 231 Mich. 317, 204 N. W. 112. With this construction placed upon the Highway Act, it is not subject to the objection that it fails to provide adequate compensation for the property owner and is therefore unconstitutional. Nor does it leave force to plaintiff's contention that, since it is here sought to condemn a railroad right of way, the procedure must be under and in accordance with the general Railroad Act rather than under the highway law.'

FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF RICHMOND(1930)\nNo. 226\nArgued: Decided: March 12, 1930\n\n\n\n Messrs. George P. Barse, of Washington, D. C., and R. E. Whiting, of Columbia, S. C., for petitioner.[ Early v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond \n281 U.S. 84\n (1930) ]\n\n\n[281 U.S. 84, 87]\n\u00a0\n Mr. M. G. Wallace, of Richmond, Va., for respondent. \n\n[281 U.S. 84, 88]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the receiver of a national bank in South Carolina, a member of the Federal Reserve System, to recover the reserve balance of that bank in the hands of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond at the end of business on October 9, 1926, when the South Carolina Bank, being insolvent, closed its doors. Other matters tried below are not in question here. The Richmond Bank claims the right to retain the balance on the following facts. As authorized by agreement, on October 7 it forwarded to the South Carolina Bank checks drawn upon the latter which the Richmond Bank had received for collection. These checks were received the next day, marked paid and charged to the accounts of the drawers. Other checks were forwarded on October 8 and marked paid and charged to the drawers by the South Carolina Bank on October 9. After notice of the failure the Richmond Bank on October 11 charged the account of the South Carolina Bank with the amount of the checks forwarded on October 7 and the next day charged what was left with the amount sent on October 8.\n The relations between the two Banks were fixed by the following terms of a circular of the Richmond Bank which was authorized by law and agreed to by the other. 'Checks received by us drawn on our member banks will be forwarded in cash letters direct to such banks and each member bank will be required either to remit therefor in immediately available funds or to provide funds available to us to meet such cash letters within the agreed transit time to and from the member bank. Therefore, the \n\n[281 U.S. 84, 89]\n\u00a0\n amount of any cash letter to a member bank is chargeable against available funds in the reserve account of such member at the expiration of such transit time, which date will be shown on each cash letter. The right is reserved, however, to charge a cash letter to the reserve account of a member bank at any time when in any particular case we deem it necessary to do so.' The transit time or time allowed for collection in this case was three days, and had not expired when the South Carolina Bank closed its doors. The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the claim of the Richmond Bank. 30 F. (2d) 198. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court.\n The petitioner contends that his bank had until the end of the transit time to remit or to provide funds to meet the cash letters, that until then the Richmond Bank had a bare power of attorney to charge the reserve fund, and that the power was revoked by the insolvency of the petitioner's bank. He denies that the reserve fund was subject to any lien until that date, and calls attention to the right of his bank to draw checks against that fund reserved to it by the law. Code, Tit. 12,  464 ( 12 USCA  464).\n All parties must be taken to have dealt upon the terms of the circular that we have quoted. The right of the South Carolina Bank to draw against its reserve account was subject to the right of the Richmond Bank that held the account to charge it with a cash letter whenever deemed necessary. This power is reserved more obviously in the interest of the depositors of the checks than of the Richmond Bank. The latter received the checks for collection with responsibility only for its own negligence. The depositor took the chance of finding that his only debtor was a distant bank in place of the maker of the check discharged (Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond v. Malloy, \n264 \nU.S. 160, 166\n, 44 S. Ct. 296, 31 A. L. R. 1261)-a bank that might be insolvent, as this one was. His situation was the one that \n\n[281 U.S. 84, 90]\n\u00a0\n most needed the power to charge the reserve. The language of the circular pointed to the depositor's interest-for the cash letter that was to be charged was merely another name for the checks that the letter contained. The existence of the power must be assumed to have been one of the considerations inducing the owner of the check to give the Richmond Bank authority to send it directly to the drawee. All parties must be taken to have understood that in the event that happened it was the duty of the Richmond Bank when it knew the facts to charge the reserve account of the South Carolina Bank, and if so the account should be charged. There was no overt act necessary in addition to what the parties had agreed upon. The case of Equitable Trust Co. v. First National Bank of Trinidad, \n275 \nU.S. 359\n, 48 S. Ct. 167, cited by the petitioner, has no application because there in the opinion of the Court there was no attempt to create a lien upon an identified fund, whereas here the reserve was identified. The fact that the fund might be diminished by drafts of the South Carolina Bank does not invalidate the lien, any more than the right of a depositor to draw against his account invalidates a banker's lien, not to speak of the paramount power of the Richmond Bank mentioned above.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEARLY v. RICHARDSON(1930)\nNo. 133\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 496, 497]\n\u00a0\n Mr. R. E. Whiting, of Columbia, S. C., for Early.\n Messrs. A. C. Hinds, of Kingstree, S. C., and Henry E. Davis, of Florence, S. C., for Richardson.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The court below has certified to this court the following question of law upon which instruction is desired:\n'Is one, who purchases shares of stock of a national bank, liable for an assessment subsequently imposed by the Comptroller of the Currency upon the stock for the benefit of the creditors of the bank after the insolvency thereof, when it appears that the purchaser bought the stock from the registered holder thereof and received a certificate therefor endorsed in blank by the holder, with \n\n[280 U.S. 496, 498]\n\u00a0\n intent at the time of such purchase and delivery of giving the stock to his minor child, but without knowledge at that time of the failing condition of the bank, or intent to avoid the stockholder's liability, and when, after the acceptance of the endorsed certificate from the seller, and before the insolvency, the purchaser with like knowledge and intent, promptly presents the certificate to the bank, causes the shares to be registered and a new certificate to be issued in the child's name?'\n\n The suit was brought to recover the amount of an assessment upon 19 shares of the capital stock of the bank ordered by the Comptroller of the Currency because the assets of the bank were insufficient to pay creditors. Richardson had purchased the stock and received three certificates therefor indorsed in blank by the seller. He delivered these certificates to the bank with verbal instructions to register the stock and issue two new certificates for 16 shares in the name of his minor son, and another one for 3 shares in the name of his minor daughter. This was done, the new certificates being retained in the custody of the bank.\n When Richardson bought the stock and received the certificates therefor, indorsed by the seller, title passed, and the transfer was complete as between the parties. Johnston v. Laflin, \n103 U.S. 800\n, 804. Thereupon, as between seller and purchaser, the purchaser alone became liable for any assessment thereafter imposed; for, as between them, it would be in disregard of all equitable principles to continue against the seller the burdens of ownership after the purchaser had become entitled to all the benefits, including the receipt of dividends. Whether under the facts the liability of the seller continued, as between him and the creditors, is a different matter not necessary to be considered; for, in any event, the purchaser, who alone is sued, is not concerned with that question.\n\n\n[280 U.S. 496, 499]\n\u00a0\n That the actual owner of the stock may be held for the assessment, although his name does not appear upon the transfer books of the bank, is well settled. Ohio Valley National Bank v. Hulitt, \n204 \nU.S. 162, 167\n, 168 S., 27 S. Ct. 179; Davis v. Stevens, 17 Blatchf. 259, 7 Fed. Cas. 177, 178 (No. 3,653); Case v. Small (C. C.) 10 F. 722, 724; Houghton v. Hubbell (C. C. A.) 91 F. 453.\n The real question is whether the intent of Richardson to buy the stock for his minor children, and the fact that by his direction the transfer was made to them upon the books of the bank and certificates issued in their names, had the effect of relieving Richardson from liability. We think not, since the traneferees, being minors, were without legal capacity to assume the obligation. Upon coming of age they would have an election either to affirm or avoid the entire transaction. In the meantime, the transfer of the stock having resulted to their disadvantage, the law will avoid it for them, thus leaving the liability of Richardson for assessments unaffected. See Aldrich v. Bingham (D. C.) 131 F. 363; Foster v. Chase (C. C.) 75 F. 797; Foster v. Wilson, Id.\n In Foster v. Chase, supra, the father bought stock in the names of his minor children, and suit was brought against him for the amount of an assessment. Disposing of the point here presented the court well said:\n'The plaintiff claims that the defendant made himself liable for the assessment because of the incapacity of his children to take the stock and make themselves liable for it. He insists that they only are the shareholders, and liable, if any one is. Assent is necessary to becoming a shareholder, subject to this liability, in a national bank. Keyser v. Hitz, \n133 \nU.S. 138\n, 10 S. Ct. 290. Minors do not seem to have anywhere the necessary legal capacity for that. The principles upon which this disability rests are elementary and universal. 1 Bl. \n\n[280 U.S. 496, 500]\n\u00a0\n Comm. 492; 2 Kent Comm. 233. In buying and paying for this stock, and having it placed on the books of the bank, the defendant acted for himself; in having it placed there in the names of his children, as with their assent, he assumed to act for them. As they could not themselves so assent as to be bound to the liabilities of a shareholder, they could not so authorize him to assent for them as to bind them. To the extent that they could not be bound he acted without legal authority, and bound only himself. Story, Ag.  280.'\n\n There is no merit in the point, made in argument, that Richardson was a trustee for the minors, even if that would enable him to avoid personal liability, Johnson v. Laflin, 5 Dill. 65, 82, Fed. Cas. No. 7,393; and there is nothing certified by the court below which furnishes a basis for the suggestion. Richardson, having bought with his own money, became the owner of the stock. And although the purchase was made with the intent of giving the stock to his children, non constat that he would not change his mind, as he was perfectly free to do. The new certificates simply were issued and registered in the names of the children, and this, if effective, would have resulted only in consummating an ordinary gift. It no more created a trust than if the donees had been persons sui juris. The question must be answered in the affirmative.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nELIASON v. WILBORN(1930)\nNo. 347\nArgued: Decided: May 19, 1930\n\n\n\n Mr. Matthias Concannon, of Chicago, Ill. (Mr. Franklin E. Vaughan, of Chicago, Ill., of counsel), for appellants.\n Messrs. Floyd E. Thompson, J. Scott Matthews, Henry Jackson Darby, and Nathan William MacChesney, all of Chicago, Ill., for appellees.\n Mr. J. Scott Matthews, of Chicago, Ill., amicus curiae for Registrar of Titles of Cook County, Illinois. \n\n[281 U.S. 457, 458]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellants had been holders of a certificate of title under the Torrens Act of Illinois. As a result of negotiations they entrusted this certificate to one Napletone, who is alleged to have presented it together with a forged conveyance to himself to the Registrar and by those means to have obtained from the Registrar a new certificate of title in Napletone, on May 19, 1926. Napletone a few days later sold and conveyed to the Wilborns, appellees, whose good faith is not questioned. After the Wilborns had bought but before a new certificate was issued to them, they had notice of the appellants' claim and the appellants notified the Registrar of the forgery and demanded a cancellation of the deeds and certificates to Napletone and the Wilborns and the issue of a certificate to themselves. The Registrar refused and this petition is brought to compel him to do what the appellants demand. It was dismissed on demurrer by the Circuit Court of the State, and the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court. 335 Ill. 352, 167 N. E. 101. The Supreme Court construed the statutes as giving title to the Wilborns, who purchased in reliance upon the certificate held by Napletone. Whether we are bound to or not we accept that construction and its result. The petitioners appealed to this Court on the ground that the statute, construed as it was construed below, deprived the appellants of their property without due process of law contrary to the Constitution of the United States, by making the certificate of title issued by the Registrar upon a forged deed without notice to them conclusive against them.\n The sections objected to are appended. They are as in the original Act of 1897 (Laws 1897, p. 139), except section 40, amended by the Laws 1925, p. 250. 1 \n\n[281 U.S. 457, 459]\n\u00a0\n The appellants seem to claim a constitutional right to buy land that has been brought under the Torrens Act free from the restrictions that that Act imposes. But they have no right of any kind to buy it unless the present owner assents, and if, as in this case, the owner from whom the appellants bought, offered and sold nothing except a Torrens title we do not perceive how they can complain that that is all that they got. Even if the restrictions were of a kind that was open to constitutional objection the appellants bought knowing them and got what they paid \n\n[281 U.S. 457, 460]\n\u00a0\n for, and knew that they were liable to lose their title without having parted with it and without being heard. Even if they had been the original holders under the Torrens Act and had attempted to save their supposed rights by protest the answer would be that they were under no compulsion when they came into the system, that an elaborate plan was offered of which the provisions objected to were an important part, and that they could take it as it was or let it alone. There are plenty of cases in which a man may lose his title when he does not mean to. If he entrusts a check indorsed in blank to a servant or friend he takes his chance. So when he entrusts goods to a bailee under some factors' acts that are well known. So, more analogous to the present case, a man may be deprived of a title by one who has none; as when an owner who has conveyed his property by a deed not yet recorded executes a second deed to another person who takes and records the later deed without notice of the former. There are few constitutional rights that may not be waived. \n\n[281 U.S. 457, 461]\n\u00a0\n But there is a narrower ground on which the appellants must be denied their demand. The statute requires the production of the outstanding certificate, as a condition to the issue of a new one. The appellants saw fit to entrust it to Napletone and they took the risk. They say that according to the construction of the act adopted the Registrar's certificate would have had the same effect even if the old certificate had not been produced. But that, if correct, is no answer. Presumably the Registrar will do his duty, and if he does he will require the old certificate to be handed in. It does not justify the omission of a precaution that probably would be sufficient, to point out that a dishonest official could get around it. There is not the slightest reason to suppose that Napletone would have got a certificate on which the Wilborns could rely without the delivery of the old one by the appellants. As between two innocent persons one of whom must suffer the consequence of a breach of trust the one who made it possible by his act of confidence must bear the loss.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 40:\n'The registered owner of any estate or interest in land brought under this Act shall, except in cases of fraud to which he is a party, \n\n or of the person through whom he claims without valuable consideration paid in good faith, hold the same subject to the charges hereinabove set forth and also only to such estate, mortgages, liens, charges and interests as may be noted in the last certificate of title in the registrar's office and free from all others except:\n (1) Any subsisting lease or agreement for a lease for a period not exceeding five years, where there is actual occupation of the land under the lease.

The amount was two per cent. of the assets handed over and it is said that without pleading or evidence the record shows this to be a reasonable charge.\n To sustain the deduction the respondents rely upon the Trading with the Enemy Act of October 6, 1917, c. 106,  12, 40 Stat. 411, 423, amended by Act of March 28, 1918, c. 28, 40 Stat. 459, 460 (50 USCA Appendix  12), by which the Alien Property Custodian is 'vested with all of the powers of a common-law trustee' in respect of all property, 'other than money,' received by him under the Act and may exercise any powers appurtenant thereto 'as though he were the absolute owner thereof.' They also invoke Executive Order, February 26, 1918 (No. 2813) that the Custodian 'may pay all reasonable and proper expenses which may be incurred in or about securing possession or control of money or other property ... and in otherwise protecting and administering the same. So far as may be, all such expenses shall be paid out of, and in any event \n\n[281 U.S. 379, 384]\n\u00a0\n recorded as a charge against, the estate to which such money or other property belongs.' Also Order of July 16, 1918 (No. 2916), of which it is necessary to mention only the direction that the expenses 'shall be limited to and paid or satisfied out of only the property or business or undertaking involved and out of which' the expenses shall have arisen provided that if the property or assets of the business are insufficient, they may be satisfied out of other property 'received from, or as the property of, the same enemy.' Under these Acts and Orders the Custodian has adopted the course followed in this case and it is further urged that his conduct is tacitly ratified by the later Acts of March 4, 1923, c. 285, adding  24 to the original Act, which embodies so much of the above orders as limits the liability to expenses incurred in respect of the same property, and to the property concerned or other property of the same person, 42 Stat. 1511, 1516 (50 USCA Appendix  24); and May 16, 1628, c. 580, 45 Stat. 573, 574, that 'all expenses of the office ... including compensation of the Alien Property Custodian ... shall be paid from interest and collections on trust funds and other properties under the control of such Custodian.' It will be observed that the charge for the expenses of the office is upon interest and collections only; that is, a deduction from income for the cost of earning it, not as in the present case, a charge upon the corpus of the fund.\n We do not perceive even in 1928 anything that clearly suggests treating the property in the hands of the Custodian as one great trust, to be called on to bear the expenses of administration, as one homogeneous whole. On the contrary the directions are explicit that the expenses charged to a given property are those incurred in getting or protecting it, or at least others similarly due from the same owner. But, and this is the main thing, all of these provisions naturally are interpreted to refer to property that the Custodian is entitled to hold. It \n\n[281 U.S. 379, 385]\n\u00a0\n would be extraordinary if the charges incident to a seizure that the law did not intend the Custodian to make and a possession that the law requires him to surrender, were to be imposed upon the owner whose interests were sacrificed up to the moment of restitution. It seems to be going far enough to require him to bear the loss that he has suffered, without compelling him to pay the Government for its outlay in doing him harm. See Hobbs v.

C., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 204, 208]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Henry R. Taylor, while domiciled and residing in New York, died testate, December 4, 1925. He had long owned and kept within that state negotiable bonds and certificates of indebtedness issued by the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. worth above $300,000. Some of these were registered, others were payable to bearer. None had any connection with business carried on by or for the decedent in Minnesota. All passed under his will, which was probated in New York. There also his estate was administered and a tax exacted upon the testamentary transfer.\n Minnesota assessed an inheritance tax upon the same transfer. Her Supreme Court approved this and upheld the validity of the authorizing statute. The executor-appellant-claims that, so construed and applied, that enactment conflicts with the Fourteenth Amendment.\n When this cause first came before the Supreme Court of Minnesota, it held negotiable public obligations were something more than mere evidences of debt and, like tangibles, taxable only at the place where found, regardless of the owner's domicile. It accordingly denied the power of that state to tax the testamentary transfer. After Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1\n, 48 S. Ct. 410, upon a rehearing, considering that cause along with Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189\n, 23 S. Ct. 277, it felt obliged to treat the bonds and certificates like ordinary choses in action and to uphold the assessment.\n Registration of certain of the bonds we regard as an immaterial circumstance. So did the court below. Counsel do not maintain otherwise. \n\n[280 U.S. 204, 209]\n\u00a0\n Under Blodgett v. Silberman the obligations here involved were rightly regarded as if ordinary choses in action. The maxim mobilia sequuntur personam applied and gave them situs for taxation in New York- the owner's domicile. The testamentary transfer was properly taxed there. This is not controverted.\n But it is said the obligations were debts of Minnesota and her corporations, subject to her control; that her laws gave them validity, protected them, and provided means for enforcing payment. Accordingly, counsel argue that they had situs for taxation purposes in that state and maintain the validity of the challenged assessment.\n Blackstone v. Miller, supra, and certain approving opinions, lend support to the doctrine that ordinarily choses in action are subject to taxation both at the debtor's domicile and at the domicile of the creditor; that two states may tax on different and more or less inconsistent principles the same testamentary transfer of such property without conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment. The inevitable tendency of that view is to disturb good relations among the states and produce the kind of discontent expected to subside after establishment of the Union. The Federalist, No. VII. The practical effect of it has bren bad; perhaps two- thirds of the states have endeavored to avoid the evil by resort to reciprocal exemption laws. It has been stoutly assailed on principle. Having reconsidered the supporting arguments in the light of our more recent opinions, we are compelled to declare it untenable. Blackstone v. Miller no longer can be regarded as a correct exposition of existing law; and to prevent misunderstanding it is definitely overruled.\n Four different views concerning the situs for taxation of negotiable public obligations have been advanced. One fixes this at the domicile of the owner; another at the debtor's domicile; a third at the place where the in \n\n[280 U.S. 204, 210]\n\u00a0\n struments are found-physically present; and the fourth within the jurisdiction where the owner has caused them to become integral parts of a localized business. It each state can adopt any one of these and tax accordingly, obviously, the same bonds may be declared present for taxation i two, or three, or four places at the same moment. Such a startling possibility suggests a wrong premise.\n In this Court the presently approved doctrine is that no state may tax anything not within her jurisdiction without violating the Fourteenth Amendment. State Tax on Foreign-Held Bonds, 15 Wall. 300; Union Refrig. Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194\n, 26 S. Ct. 36, 39, 4 Ann. Cas. 493; Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia ( November 25, 1929) \n280 \nU.S. 83\n, 50 S. Ct. 59. Also no state can tax the testamentary transfer of property wholly beyond her power, Rhode Island Trust Co. v. Doughton, \n270 \nU.S. 69\n, 46 S. Ct. 256, 43 A. L. R. 1374, or impose death duties reckoned upon the value of tangibles permanently located outside her limits. Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473\n, 45 S. Ct. 603, 42 A. L. R. 316. These principles became definitely settled subsequent to Blackstone v. Miller and are out of harmony with the reasoning advanced to support the conclusion there announced.\n At this time it cannot be assumed that tangible chattels permanently located within another state may be treated as part of the universal succession and taken into account when estimating the succession tax laid at the decedent's domicile. Frick v. Pennsylvania is to the contrary.\n Nor is it permissible broadly to say that, notwithstanding the Fourteenth Amendment, two states have power to tax the same personalty on different and inconsistent principles or that a state always may tax according to the fiction that in successions after death mobilia sequuntur personam and domicile govern the whole. Upon Refrig. Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra; Rhode Island Trust Co. v. Doughton, supra; and Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia, supra, stand in opposition. \n\n[280 U.S. 204, 211]\n\u00a0\n Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, \n222 \nU.S. 63\n, 32 S. Ct. 13, indicates plainly enough that the right of one state to tax may depend somewhat upon the power of another so to do. And Coe v. Errol, \n116 \nU.S. 517, 524\n, 6 S. Ct. 475, 477, though frequently cited to support the general affirmation that nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits double taxation, does not go so far. It affirmed the rather obvious proposition that the mere fact of taxation of tangibles by one state is not enough to exclude the right of another to tax them.\n'If the owner of personal property within a state resides in another state, which taxes him for that property as part of his general estate attached to his person, this action of the latter state does not in the least affect the right of the state in which the property is situated to tax it also. ... The fact, therefore, that the owners of the logs in question were taxed for their value in Maine as a part of their general stock in trade, if such fact were proved, could have no influence in the decision of the case, and may be laid out of view.'\n\n If Maine undertook to tax logs permanently located in another state, she transcended her legitimate powers. Union Refrig. Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra. Of course, such action could not affect New Hampshire's rights in respect of property localized within her limits.\n While debts have no actual territorial situs, we have ruled that a state may properly apply the rule mobilia sequuntur personam and treat them as localized at the creditor's domicile for taxation purposes. Tangibles with permanent situs therein, and their testamentary transfer, may be taxed only by the state where they are found. And, we think, the general reasons declared sufficient to inhibit taxation of them by two states apply under present circumstances with no less force to intangibles with taxable situs imposed by due application of the legal fiction. Primitive conditions have passed; business is \n\n[280 U.S. 204, 212]\n\u00a0\n now transacted on a national scale. A very large part of the country's wealth is invested in negotiable securities whose protection against discrimination, unjust and oppressive taxation, is matter of the greatest moment. Twenty-four years ago Union Refrig. Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra, declared: 'In view of the enormous increase of such property (tangible personalty) since the introduction of railways and the growth of manufactures, the tendency has been in recent years to treat it as having a situs of its own for the purpose of taxation, and correlatively to exempt it at the domicile of the owner.' And, certainly, existing conditions no less imperatively demand protection of choses in action against multiplied taxation whether following misapplication of some legal fiction or conflicting theories concerning the sovereign's right to exact contributions. For many years the trend of decisions here has been in that direction.\n Taxation is an intensely practical matter, and laws in respect of it should be construed and applied with a view of avoiding, so far as possible, unjust and oppressive consequences. We have determined that in general intangibles may be properly taxed at the domicile reason for saying that they at the domicile of their owner, and we can are not entitled to enjoy an immunity against taxation at more than one place similar to that accorded to tangibles. The difference between the two things, although obvious enough, seems insufficient to justify the harsh and oppressive discrimination against intangibles contended for on behalf of Minnesota.\n Cleveland, Painesville & Ashtabula Railroad Co. v. Pennsylvania- 'State Tax on Foreigh-Held Bonds Case'-15 Wall. 300, 320, distinctly held that the state was without power to tax the owner of bonds of a domestic railroad corporation made and payable outside her limits when issued to and held by citizens and residents of another state. Through Mr. Justice Field the Court there said: \n\n[280 U.S. 204, 213]\n\u00a0\n 'But debts owing by corporations, like debts owing by individuals, are not property of the debtors in any sense; they are obligations of the debtors, and only possess value in the hands of the creditors. With them they are property, and in their hands they may be taxed. To call debts property of the debtors, is simply to misuse terms. All the property there can be in the nature of things, in debts of corporations, belongs to the creditors, to whom they are payable, and follows their domicil, wherever that may be. Their debts can have no locality separate from the parties to whom they are due. This principle might be stated in many different ways, and supported by citations in numerous adjudications, but no number of authorities and no forms of expression could add anything to its obvious truth, which is recognized upon its simple statement.'\n If the situs of the bonds for taxation had been at the debtor's domicile-Pennsylvania-the challenged effort to tax could not have interfered unduly with the debtor's contract to pay interest.\n New Orleans v. Stemple, \n175 \nU.S. 309\n, 20 S. Ct. 110; Bristol v. Washington County, \n177 \nU.S. 133\n, 20 S. Ct. 585; Liverpool, etc., Ins. Co. v. Board of Assessors for the Parish of Orleans, \n221 \nU.S. 346\n, 31 S. Ct. 550, L. R. A. 1915C, 903, recognize the principle that choses in action may acquire a situs for taxation other than at the domicile of their owner, if they have become integral parts of some local business. The present record gives no occasion for us to inquire whether such securities can be taxed a second time at the owner's domicile.\n The bonds and certificates of the decedent had acquired permanent situs for taxation in New York; their testamentary transfer was properly taxable there, but not in Minnesota.\n The judgment appealed from must be reversed. The cause will be remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n[280 U.S. 204, 214]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (concurring).\n I concur in the result. Whether or not control over a debt at the domicile of the debtor gives jurisdiction to tax the debt, Liverpool & London & Globe Insurance Co. v. Board of Assessors, \n221 \nU.S. 346, 354\n, 31 S. Ct. 550, L. R. A. 1915C, 903, we are not here concerned with a property tax, but with an excise or privilege tax imposed on the transfer of an intangible, see Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137\n, 45 S. Ct. 424, 44 A. L. R. 1454; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260\n, 48 S. Ct. 225, and to sustain a privilege tax the privilege must be enjoyed in the state imposing it, Provident Savings Association v. Kentucky, \n239 \nU.S. 103\n, 36 S. Ct. 34, L. R. A. 1916C, 572. It is enough, I think, to uphold the present decision that the transfer was effected in New York by one domiciled there and is controlled by its law.\n Even though the contract transferred was called into existence of the laws of Minnesota, its obligation cannot be constitutionally impaired or withdrawn from the protection which those laws gave it at its inception. See Provident Savings Association v. Kentucky, \n239 \nU.S. 103, 113\n, 36 S. Ct. 34, L. R. A. 1916C, 572; Bedford v. Eastern Building & Loan Association, \n181 \nU.S. 227\n, 21 S. Ct. 597. And, while the creditor may rely on Minnesota law to enforce the debt, that may be equally true of the law of any other state where the debtor or his property may be found. So far as the transfer, as distinguished from the contract itself, is concerned, it is New York law and not that of Minnesota which, by generally accepted rules, it applied there and receives recognition elsewhere. See Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625, 631\n, 36 S. Ct. 473; Russell v. Grigsby (C. C. A.) 168 F. 577; Lee v. Abdy, 17 Q. B. Div. 309; Miller v. Campbell, 140 N. Y. 457, 460, 35 N. E. 651; Spencer v. Myers, 150 N. Y. 269, 44 N. E. 942, 34 L. R. A. 175, 55 Am. St. Rep. 675. Once the bonds had passed beyond the state and were acquired by an owner domiciled elsewhere, the law of Minnesota neither protected, nor could it withhold the power of transfer or prescribe its terms. \n\n[280 U.S. 204, 215]\n\u00a0\n In the light of these considerations, granting that the continued existence of the contract rested in part on the law of Minnesota, the relation of that law to the transfer in New York, both in point of theory and in every practical aspect, appears to me to be too attenuated to constitute any reasonable basis for deeming the transfer to be within the taxing jurisdiction of Minnesota.\n As the present is not a tax on the debt, but only on the transfer of it, neither the analogies drawn from the law of property taxes nor the attempt to solve the present problem by ascribing to a legal relationship unconnected with any physical thing, a fictitious situs, can, I think, carry us very far toward a solution. Nor does it seem that the invocation of the Fourteenth Amendment to relieve from the burdens of double taxation, as such, promises more.\n Hitherto the fact that taxation is 'double' has not been deemed to affect its constitutionality, and there are, I think, too many situations in which a single economic interest may have such legal relationships with different taxing jurisdictions as to justify its taxation in both to admit of our laying down any constitutional principle broadly prohibiting taxation merely because it is double, at least until that characterization is more precisely defined.\n It seems to me to be unnecessary and undesirable to lay down any doctrine whose extent and content are so dubious. Whether it is far reaching enough to overturn those cases which, in circumstances differing somewhat from the present, have been regarded as permitting taxation in more than one state, reaching the same economic interest, is so uncertain as to suggest doubts as to its trustworthiness and utility as a principle of judicial decision. See Wheeler v. Sohmer, \n233 \nU.S. 434\n, 34 S. Ct. 607, and Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1\n, 48 S. Ct. 410; Scottish Union & National \n\n[280 U.S. 204, 216]\n\u00a0\n Ins. Co. v.

Louisville, \n245 \nU.S. 54, 58\n, 38 S. Ct. 40, L. R. A. 1918C, 124; Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625, 631\n, 36 S. Ct. 473.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n This is a proceeding for the determination of a tax alleged to be due to the State of Minnesota but objected to by the appellant as contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The tax is imposed in respect of the transfer by will of bonds and certificates of indebtedness of the State of Minnesota and bonds of two cities of that State. The testator died domiciled in New York and the bonds were there at the time of his death. The Supreme Court of the State upheld the tax, 176 Minn. 634, 222 N. W. 528, and the executor appeals.\n It is not disputed that the transfer was taxable in New York, but there is no constitutional objection to the same transaction being taxed by two States, if the laws of both have to be invoked in order to give it effect. It may be assumed that the transfer considered by itself alone depends on the law of New York, but if he law of Minnesota is necessary to the existence of anything beyond a piece of paper to be transferred then Minnesota may demand payment for a privilege that could not exist without its help. It seems to me that the law of Minnesota is a \n\n[280 U.S. 204, 217]\n\u00a0\n present force necessary to the existence of the obligation, and that therefore, however contrary it may be to enlightened policy, the tax is good.\n No one would doubt that the law of Minnesota was necessary to call the obligation into existence. Other States do not attempt to determine the legal consequences of acts done outside of their jurisdiction, and therefore whether certain acts done in Minnesota constitute a contract or not depends on the law of Minnesota alone. I think the same thing is true of the continuance of the obligation to the present time. It seems to me that it is the law of Minnesota alone that keeps the debt alive. Obviously at the beginning that law could have provided that the debt should be extinguished by the death of the creditor or by such other event as that law might point out. It gave the debt its duration. The continued operation of that law keeps the debt alive. Not to go too far into the field of speculation but confining the discussion to cities of the State and the State itself, the continued existence of the cities and the readiness of the State to keep its promises depend upon the will of the State. If there were no Constitution the State might abolish the debt by its fiat. The only effect of the Constitution is that the law that originally gave the bonds continuance remains in force unchanged. But it is still the law of that State and no other. When such obligation are enforced by suit in another State it is on the footing of recognition, not of creation, Deutsche Bank Filiale Nurnberg v. Humphrey, \n272 \nU.S. 517, 519\n, 47 S. Ct. 166. Another State, if it is civilized, does not undertake to say to the debtor now that we have caught you we will force an obligation upon you whether you still are bound by the law of your own State or not. I believe this to be the vital point. Unless I am wrong the debt, wherever enforced, is enforced only because it is recognized as such by the law that created it and keeps it still a debt. No doubt sometimes obligations are enforced elsewhere when \n\n[280 U.S. 204, 218]\n\u00a0\n the statute of limitations has run at home. But such decisions when defensible stand on the ground that the limitation is only procedural and does not extinguish the duty. If the statute extinguishes the debt by lapse of time no foreign jurisdiction that intelligently understood its function would attempt to make the debtor pay.\n I will not repeat what I said the other day in Safe Deposit & Trust Co. of Baltimore v. Virginia (November 25, 1929), concerning the attempt to draw conclusions from the supposed situs of a debt. The right to tax exists in this case because the party needs the help of Minnesota to acquire a right, and that State can demand a quid pro quo in return. Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, \n222 \nU.S. 63, 68\n, 32 S. Ct. 13; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 206\n, 26 S. Ct. 36, 4 Ann. Cas. 493.\n I do not dwell on the practical necessity of resorting to the State in order to secure payment of state or municipal bonds. Even if the creditor had a complete and adequate remedy elsewhere, I still should think that a correct decision of the case must rest on whether I am right or not about the theoretical cal dependence of the continued existence of the bonds upon Minnesota law.\n Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189\n, 23 S. Ct. 277, supports my conclusions and I do not think that it should be overruled. A good deal has to be read into the Fourteenth Amendment to give it any bearing upon this case. The Amendment does not condemn everything that we may think undesirable on economic or social grounds.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS agrees with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","49":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFEDERAL RADIO COMMISSION v. GENERAL ELECTRIC CO.(1930)\nNo. 122\nArgued: Decided: May 19, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 464, 465]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Bethuel M. Webster, Jr., of New York City (Mr. Paul M. Segal, of Washington, D. C., on the brief), for Federal Radio Commission.\n Court declined to hear further argument.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A review is sought here of a decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia given on an appeal from an order of the Radio Commission.\n The General Electric Company owned and was operating a broadcasting station at Schenectady, N. Y., when the Radio Act of 1927 went into effect. Thereafter it sought and obtained from the commission successive licenses under that act for the further operation of the station. The last license was issued November 1, 1927, for that calendar month and was prolonged until November 11, 1928, by successive short extensions. \n\n[281 U.S. 464, 466]\n\u00a0\n January 14, 1928, the company made application for a renewal of that license. The application was not acted upon until October 12, 1928, and then the commission ordered that a license be not issued with terms like those of the existing license, but that one be issued with other terms much less advantageous to the company and the communities which it was serving; the chief change being a pronounced reduction in the admissible hours of service. The company regarded this order as a refusal of its application for a renewal of the existing license and prosecuted an appeal, under section 16 of the act of 1927 (47 USCA  96), to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. After a hearing that court found from the record returned by the commission that public convenience, interest, and necessity would be served by renewing the existing license without change in its terms, and on that basis held that such a renewal should be granted and that the proceeding should be remanded to the commission with a direction to carry the court's decision into effect. Costs were assessed against the commission. 58 App. D. C. 386, 31 F.(2d) 630. On the petition of the commission certiorari was then granted by this court \n280 \nU.S. 537\n, 50 S. Ct. 20, 74 L.

The act, as amended in 1928, c. 263, 45 Stat. 373, and 1929, c. 701, 45 Stat. 1559, directs that no broadcasting station be used in such communication except in accordance with the act and under a license granted for the purpose; authorizes the Radio Commission to grant station licenses and renewals thereof, both for periods not exceeding three months, and otherwise gives it wide powers in administering the act; restricts the granting of station licenses and renewals to instances 'where public convenience, interest or necessity \n\n[281 U.S. 464, 467]\n\u00a0\n will be served thereby'; authorized the commission to determine the question of public convenience, interest, or necessity; declares that decisions of the commission in all matters over which it has jurisdiction 'shall be final, subject to the right of appeal' therein given; provides ( section 16) that any applicant for a station license or the renewal of such a license, whose application is refused by the commission, may appeal from such decision to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia; directs that the grounds of the appeal be stated and the revision be confined to them; requires the commission, where an appeal is taken, to transmit to the court the originals or certified copies of all papers and evidence presented upon the application refused, together with a copy of the commission's decision and a statement of the facts and grounds of the decision; authorizes the court to take additional evidence upon such terms and conditions as it may deem proper; and provides that the court 'shall hear, review and determine the appeal upon said record and evidence, and may alter or revise the decision appealed from and enter such judgment as to it may seem just.'\n We think it plain from this re sume of the pertinent parts of the act that the powers confided to the commission respecting the granting and renewal of station licenses are purely administrative, and that the provision for appeals to the Court of Appeals does no more than make that court a superior and revising agency in the same field. The court's province under that provision is essentially the same as its province under the legislation which up to a recent date permitted appeals to it from administrative decisions of the Commissioner of Patents. \n1\n Indeed, the provision in the act of 1927 is patterned largely \n\n[281 U.S. 464, 468]\n\u00a0\n after that legislation. And while a few differences are found, there is none that is material here.\n Referring to the provisions for patent appeals this court said in Butterworth v. U. S., \n112 \nU.S. 50, 60\n, 5 S. Ct. 25, that the function of the court thereunder was not that of exercising ordinary jurisdiction at law or in equity, but of taking a step in the statutory proceeding under the patent laws in aid of the Patent Office. And in Postum Cereal Company v. California Fig Nut Company, \n272 \nU.S. 693, 698\n, 47 S. Ct. 284, 285, which related to a provision for a like appeal in a trade-mark proceeding, this court held: 'The decision of the Court of Appeals under section 9 of the act of 1905 2 is not a judicial judgment. It is a mere administrative decision. It is merely an instruction to the Commissioner of Patents by a court which is made part of the machinery of the Patent Office for administrative purposes.' Another case in point is Keller v. Potomac Electric Power Co., \n261 U.S. 428\n, 442-444, 43 S. Ct. 445, which involved a statutory proceeding in the courts of the District of Columbia to revise an order of a commission fixing the valuation of the property of a public utility for future rate-making purposes. There this court held that the function assigned to the courts of the District in the statutory proceeding was not judicial in the sense of the Constitution, but was legislative and advisory, because it was that of instructing and aiding the commission in the exertion of power which was essentially legislative.\n In the cases just cited, as also in others, it is recognized that the courts of the District of Columbia are not created under the judiciary article of the Constitution but are legislative courts, and therefore that Congress may invest them with jurisdiction of appeals and proceedings such as have been just described. \n\n[281 U.S. 464, 469]\n\u00a0\n But this court cannot be invested with jurisdiction of that character, whether for purposes of review or otherwise. It was brought into being by the judiciary article of the Constitution, is invested with judicial power only, and can have no jurisdiction other than of cases and controversies falling within the classes enumerated in that article. It cannot give decisions which are merely advisory; nor can it exercise or participate in the exercise of functions which are essentially legislative or administrative. Keller v. Potomac Electric Power Co., supra, page 444, of 261 U. S., 43 S. Ct. 445, and cases cited; Postum Cereal Co. v. California Fig Nut Company, supra, pages 700-701 of \n272 U.S. 47\n S.

Ct. 507; Ex parte Bakelite Corporation, \n279 \nU.S. 438, 449\n, 49 S. Ct. 411.\n The proceeding on the appeal from the commission's action is quite unlike the proceeding, under sections 1001(a) to 1004(b) of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat., pt. 2, p. 109 (26 USCA  1224-1227), on a petition for the review of a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals; for, as this court heretofore has pointed out, such a petition (a) brings before the reviewing court the United States or its representative on the one hand and the interested taxpayer on the other, (b) presents for consideration either the right of the United States to the payment of a tax claimed to be due from the taxpayer or his right to have refunded to him money which he has paid to satisfy a tax claimed to have been erroneously charged against him, and (c) calls for a judicial and binding determination of the matter so presented-all of which makes the proceeding a case or controversy within the scope of the judicial power as defined in the judiciary article. Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, \n279 U.S. 716\n, 724-727, 49 S. Ct. 499.\n And what is said in some of the cases already cited respecting the nature and purpose of suits to enforce or \n\n[281 U.S. 464, 470]\n\u00a0\n set aside orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, as also orders of the Federal Trade Commission, makes it apparent that the jurisdiction exercised in those suits is not administrative, but strictly judicial, and therefore quite unlike the jurisdiction exercised on appeals from the Radio Commission.\n Of course the action of the Court of Appeals in assessing the costs against the commission did not alter the nature of the proceeding.\n Our conclusion is that the proceeding in that court was not a case or controversy in the sense of the judiciary article, but was an administrative proceeding, and therefore that the decision therein is not reviewable by this court.\n Writ of certiorari dismissed.\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sections 59-62, title 35 U.

DRYGOODS CO. v. UNITED STATES(1930)\nNo. 118\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 453, 454]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James Craig Peacock, of Washington, D. C., and E. H. Randolph, of Shreveport, La., for the Drygoods Company.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Harold C. Haskell, of Watertown, Mass., for the Rubber Company.\n Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Providence, R. I.,\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 453, 455]\n\u00a0\n for the United States and white.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases, which were argued together, present the same questions. In each case, the taxpayer seeks to recover with interest an amount assessed and collected, after March 15, 1925, as an additional income and excess-profits tax for 1918 under the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057). In each, the claim is that both the assessment and the collection were made after the expiration of the time allowed therefor. In a long line of cases arising out of similar facts, the Board of Tax Appeals has held consistently that neither the assessment nor the collection was made too late. \n1\n In No. 414 the action was brought in the federal court for Massachusetts against the collector to recover $39,043.99. The District Court, without passing on the timeliness of the assessment, held that the collection was barred and entered judgment for the plaintiff, 28 F.(2d) 54. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the judgment on the ground that the assessment was barred, and expressed no opinion on the question decided by the District Court, 33 F.(2d) 739. In No. 118, the action was brought in the federal court for western Louisiana against the United States to recover $11,282.15. \n\n[280 U.S. 453, 456]\n\u00a0\n That court, deciding both questions in favor of the Government, entered a judgment for the defendant, 26 F.(2d) 505, which was affirmed, on both grounds, by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 29 F.(2d) 895. In other federal courts, also, there has been diversity of opinion. \n2\n This court granted writs of certiorari, \n280 \nU.S. 539\n, 50 S. Ct. 17, 74 L. Ed. -.\n First. Whether the assessment was barred depends upon whether the period of limitation was started by the filing before March 15, 1919, of a so-called 'tentative return,' or by the later filing of a so-called 'completed return.' The question arises in this way: The Revenue Act of 1918 was not approved until February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057. Section 241(a) required that returns on the basis of the calendar year should be made on or before the 15th day of March. Section 239 required that a corporation's return should state 'specifically the items of its gross income and the deductions and credits allowed.' The form of return prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for giving this information, known as Form 1120, is an elaborate document composed of a 'summary' in four schedules, with eleven supporting schedules and twenty- six subschedules. The 'summary' calls for the specification of some 93 items. The supporting schedules and subschedules call for the specification of some 357 items; and of as many more items to be stated in appendices as the circumstances of the particular taxpayers might require. 3 \n\n[280 U.S. 453, 457]\n\u00a0\n It was obvious that many corporations would be unable, in the short interval between February 24 and March 15, to prepare their returns in time. Sections 227(a) and 241(a) authorized the Commissioner to 'grant a reasonable extension of time for filing returns whenever in his judgment good cause exists.' But section 250(a) provided that 'where an extension of time for filing a return is granted the time for payment of the first installment shall be postponed until the date of the expiration of the period of the extension.' The necessities of the Government made it undesirable that payments on account of the first installment of taxes be postponed. To meet this situation, the following policy was announced in a public statement issued by the Commissioner: 'Although no general extension of time will be authorized for filing the Federal Income Tax returns due March 15, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has approved a novel feature of tax collection which will serve for all practical purposes as a possible extension of forty-five days for the filing of corporation income and excess profits tax returns. ... If a corporation finds that ... it is impossible to complete its return by March 15, it may make a return of the estimated tax due and make payment thereof not later than March 15. If meritorious reason is shown,' the completed return could be filed within forty-five days \n\n[280 U.S. 453, 458]\n\u00a0\n after that date. The statement continued: 'Provision for systematically handling this new feature will be made in the construction of the new return blanks ... embodied in which is a detachable letter of remittance. Any corporation which finds that, for sufficient reasons, it cannot complete its return by March 15, may detach and fill out the letter of remittance, and forward same to the collector on or before March 15, together with a check ... for the tax due on that date. ... A statement in writing of the reasons why it is impossible for the corporation to complete the return by the specified date must accompany every such remittance.' \n4\n The device was modified by a further statement on February 27, 1919. A separate blank, known as Form 1031T, and entitled 'Tentative Return and Estimate of Corporation Income and Profits Taxes and Request for Extension of Time for Filing Return,' was to be used instead of the detachable letter of remittance. This blank was in the form of a letter to the collector and contained, besides instructions and the oath of the president and treasurer, only a statement that one-fourth of the estimated amount of taxes was remitted therewith and that an extension of time to file the complete return was requested for the reasons stated.\n Each corporation executed the tentative return, Form 1031T, and sent it, with a remittance of one-quarter of the estimated tax, to the collector on or before March 15, 1919. The Florsheim Company filed its complete return, \n\n[280 U.S. 453, 459]\n\u00a0\n Form 1120, on June 16, 1919; the Hood Company, on July 14, 1919. Section 250(d) of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1083) provided that 'the amount of tax due under any return shall be determined and assessed by the Commissioner within five years after the return was due or was made ....' This period was extended under the Revenue Act of 1921, November 23, 1921, c. 136,  250(d), 42 Stat. 227, 265, 266, which provided that the amount of the tax under the 1918 Act should be 'determined and assessed within five years after the return was filed, unless both the Commissioner and the taxpayer consent in writing to a later determination, assessment, and collection of the tax.' \n5\n In each of the cases at bar, the Commissioner and the taxpayers executed, prior to March 15, 1924, an instrument called 'Income and Profits Tax Waiver.' The waivers stated that 'In pursuance of the provisions of subdivision (d) of section 250 of the revenue act of 1921,' the Commissioner and the taxpayer 'consent to a determination, assessment, and collection of the amount of income, excess-profits, or war- profits taxes due under any return made. ... This waiver is in effect from the date it is signed by the taxpayer and will remain in effect for a period of one year after the expiration of the statutory period of limitation. ...' In each case, the assessment was made more than six years after March 15, 1919, but within six years after the filing of the completed return on Form 1120. If Form 1031T was 'the return' within the meaning of the above provisions as to limitation, then the assessments were made too late.\n We are of opinion that the filing of the document known as Form 1031T, duly executed, did not start the running \n\n[280 U.S. 453, 460]\n\u00a0\n of the period of limitation. Form 1031T is not an instrument expressly provided for in the act. It is not in the nature of a 'list,' 'schedule,' or 'return,' commonly required by tax statutes. It was an invention of the Commissioner designed to meet a peculiar exigency. Its purpose was to secure to the taxpayer a needed extension of time for filing the required return, without defeating the Government's right to prompt payment of the first installment. As Form 1031T made no reference to income, or to deductions or credits, it could not have been intended as the return 'stating specifically the items of ... gross income, and the deductions and credits'-the return required to satisfy the statute.\n Section 3182 of the Revised Statutes, U. S. C. tit. 26,  102 (26 USCA  102), provides that the Commissioner shall 'make the inquiries, determinations, and assessments of all taxes ... and shall certify a list of such assessments ... to the proper collectors.' Section 250(b) of the 1918 Act (40 Stat. 1083) required that 'as soon as practicable after the return is filed, the Commissioner shall examine it. If it then appears that the correct amount of the tax is greater or less than that shown in the return, the installments shall be recomputed.' It was to serve these purposes that section 239 required all corporations to make returns 'stating specifically the items of ... gross income and the deductions and credits.' The burden of supplying by the return the information on which assessments were to be based was thus imposed upon the taxpayer. And, in providing that the period of limitation should begin on the date when the return was filed, rather than when it was due, the statute plainly manifested a purpose that the period was to commence only when the taxpayer had supplied this information in the prescribed manner. Form 1120 provided for furnishing the data which would enable the Commissioner to make a determination, assessment, and recomputation. Form 1031T furnished no data which \n\n[280 U.S. 453, 461]\n\u00a0\n could, in any way, aid him in that connection. It is true that even the complete return on Form 1120 need not be accepted by the Commissioner as the sole basis for the determination of the amount of the tax. Assessments are frequently based on audits of the Income Tax Unit. However, the purpose of these audits is not to eliminate the necessity of filing the return, but to safeguard against error or dishonesty.\n The corporations concede that section 239 defined the nature of the return required and referred to in the several provisions of the act, and that Form 1031T did not comply with that section; but, in support of their contention that the tentative return, Form 1031T, started the running of the period of limitation, they present the following arguments. They urge that the sufficiency of a return for the purpose of starting the period of limitations does not depend upon a strict compliance with the requirements of section 239; that the act required but one return, that Form 1031T was a formal document prescribed by the Commissioner, called a 'return' and so termed on its face, and that the complete return should therefore be treated as an amendment or completion of the tentative return; that Form 1031T was a sufficient return to start the period of limitation, because it was sufficient to prevent the extension of time for the payment of the first installment of the tax pursuant to section 250(a); because it was a sufficient return under section 250(e) to constitute notice and demand for the payment of the first installment; because it was a sufficient return to form the basis of an assessment, which, under the law, must be based on a return; and because it was a sufficient return to subject taxpayers to the penalties provided by section 3176 of the Revised Statutes (26 USCA  97, 98) and section 253 of the act (40 Stat. 1085), for failure to file it on time.\n These arguments ignore the differences in nature and purpose between Form 1031T and the return required by \n\n[280 U.S. 453, 462]\n\u00a0\n the act. The mere fact that Form 1031T was a formal document prescribed by the Commissioner and termed a 'return' does not identify it as the return required by the act. The word 'return' is not a technical word of art. It may be true that the filing of a return which is defective or incomplete under section 239 is sufficient to start the running of the period of limitation; and that the filing of an amended return does not toll the period. \n6\n But the defective or incomplete return purports to be a specific statement of the items of income, deductions, and credits in compliance with section 239. And, to have that effect, it must honestly and reasonably be intended as such. There is not a pretense of such purpose with respect to Form 1031T. Nor is it the purpose of Form 1120 to supply or correct something omitted or misstated in Form 1031T. The latter was neither defective nor incomplete. The extension of time for the payment of the first installment was prevented, not because Form 1031T was considered a return in compliance with the statute, but because the Commissioner exacted payment as a condition for the requested extension of time to file the return. The penalties were to be imposed for the failure to file, or the late filing, of the detailed return above described. And the penalties were avoided, not by the filing of Form 1031T as a substantial compliance with the requirement of a return, but, as expressly stated in that form, by the extension of time to file which was granted 'in consideration of the filing of this tentative return and the payment of not less than one- fourth of the estimated amount of the tax, and for the reasons stated.' Obviously, without the payment of the first installment \n\n[280 U.S. 453, 463]\n\u00a0\n and the consequent grant of an extension of time, the mere filing of Form 1031T would not have avoided the penalties prescribed for the late filing of the return required by the act. \n7\n Nor would the penalties have been avoided by the filing of that form, if the complete return were not filed within the extended time.\n The contention that because Form 1031T was sufficient as a notice and demand under section 250(e), it was a sufficient return to start the period of limitation, is equally unsound. That section did not prescribe the exclusive mode for the notice and demand for payment of the first installment. Any instrument containing the notice and demand would be as efficacious for that purpose as the return required by the statute. Finally, the argument that Form 1031T was a sufficient return to furnish the basis for assessment lacks significance, whether or not it is sound. \n8\n The Commissioner is not confined to the taxpayer's return for the basis of his assessment. He may secure additional information; and he may assess the tax even if the taxpayer files no return. Rev. Stat.  3176, \n\n[280 U.S. 453, 464]\n\u00a0\n U. S. C. tit. 26,  97 (26 USCA  97); Revenue Act 1918,  250(c), 40 Stat. 1083. The mere fact that, in the absence of any information, the Commissioner might be compelled to assess the tax on the basis of the taxpayer's estimate, does not transform that simple estimate of the amount of the tax into the detailed return of the items of gross income, deductions, and credits required by the act. Form 1031T was only a formal substitute for the simple letter originally planned, remitting payment and requesting an extension. That it was called 'Tentative Return' is of no significance. It was termed also 'Estimate of Corporation Income And Profits Taxes And Request For Extension of Time For Filing Return.'\n It has been said that the Government is assuming an inconsistent and unconscionable attitude. But there is nothing inconsistent or unconscionable in its position. The Commissioner did not represent that the date of filing Form 1031T would be treated as the beginning of the period of limitation. And it is not clear that he had the power to shorten the period prescribed by the statute. The Government has not treated Form 1031T for any purpose as the return required by the Act. The tentative return was confessedly a novel device. It imposed no hardship on taxpayers. Indeed, it enabled them to save the interest charge which otherwise would have attened an extension of time to file the return and pay the first installment. Notice of the Commissioner's intention to assess deficiencies in stated amounts was given to the corporations much before March 15, 1925. The delay in the assessments past that date was due to negotiations with the Commissioner which resulted in the reduction of those amounts to less than half in the one case and to about one-sixth in the other. The corporations are in no position to complain of the Government's action.\n Second. The claim that, even if the assessment was timely, the collection was barred, depends upon the effect \n\n[280 U.S. 453, 465]\n\u00a0\n of the 'Income and Profits Tax Waiver,' and the applicability of the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926. As previously stated, both corporations and the Commissioner executed this instrument pursuant to section 250(d) of the 1921 Act (42 Stat. 265), prior to March 15, 1924, and consented to the determination, assessment, and collection of the tax, 'this waiver' to be in effect for one year after the expiration of the statutory period of limitation. Under the 1921 Act,  250(d), this period was five years after the return was filed. The Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926 extended the period for collection to six years after the date of assessment; June 2, 1924, c. 234,  278(d), 43 Stat. 253, 300 (26 USCA  1061 note) Feb. 26, 1926, c. 27,  278(d), 44 Stat. 9, 59 (26 USCA  1061). In both cases proceedings for collection of the tax were begun more than six years after either the tentative or the complete returns were filed, but less than six years after the assessments were made. In the Florsheim case, collection was effected in 1925; in the Hood case, in 1926, after the passage of the 1926 Act.\n The Government contends that the 'Income and Profits Tax Waivers' executed by the corporations were waivers by them of the statutory period for another year; that while these waivers were still in force and while the corporations' liability was thus still alive, the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926 were passed, increasing the period for collection to six years after assessment; that these acts are applicable to the cases at bar; and that, since the collections were made within six years after the assessments, they were timely made. The corporations insist that the 'Waivers' were not merely waivers extending the statutory period, but were binding contracts which limited the time in which the Commissioner could assess and collect the taxes; and that no change in the law made after the date of the contracts and enlarging the time for collection can affect their rights. They urge that the 1924 and 1926 acts did not purport to extend the \n\n[280 U.S. 453, 466]\n\u00a0\n periods thus limited by contract; and that, if construed as extending such periods, the provisions of these acts are unconstitutional. They concede that, in the absence of contract, a Legislature may constitutionally lengthen or shorten the period in which a right may be enforced by legal proceedings.\n We are of opinion that the contention of the Government must prevail. The waivers executed by the parties were not contracts binding the Commissioner not to make the assessments and collections after the periods specified. At the time when the waivers were executed, the Commissioner was without power under the statute to assess or collect the taxes after the statutory period, as extended by the waivers. A promise by the Commissioner not to do what by the statute he was precluded from doing, would have been of no significance. The waivers do not purport to contain such a promise. Bank of Commerce v. Rose (D. C.) 26 F.(2d) 365, 366; Greylock Mills v. Commissioner (C. C. A.) 31 F.(2d) 655, 657. And obviously, the Commissioner did not undertake to limit the power of Congress to extend the period of limitations, as consideration for the waivers. The instruments were nothing more than what they were termed on their face-waivers; and that was all to which the Commissioner was authorized to consent.\n Stress is laid on the use of the words 'agree' and 'agreement' in the acts and regulations. But these are ordinary words having no technical significance. It is also urged that, unless a contract was intended, there is no reason why the consent of the Commissioner should have been required. But an otherwise plain meaning should not be distorted merely for the sake of finding a purpose for this administrative requirement. If a reason must be found, it exists in the general desirability of the requirement as an administrative matter. It serves to keep the Commissioner in closer touch with the matters which he \n\n[280 U.S. 453, 467]\n\u00a0\n is charged to administer. It avoids claims of improvident execution of waivers and unauthorized exactions by subordinates of the Department for the purpose of curing their own delinquencies. And it provides a formal procedure which is generally desirable for the Commissioner, collectors, and subordinates in the Department. That other means might have been devised for the same purpose is of no significance.\n The question as to the applicability of the later acts may be briefly disposed of. Section 1100 of the Revenue Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 352) repealed the 1921 Act. Section 277(a)(2) of the 1924 Act9 expressly dealt with taxes due under the Acts of 1918 and 1921; and it reenacted the five- year limitation with the express qualification, 'Except as provided in section 278.' Section 278(c) 10 re-enacted the provision as to extension of time by the consent of the Commissioner and the taxpayer; and constituted the sole statutory authority for the waiver of the period of limitation for taxes due under the 1918 and 1921 Acts. It unquestionably applied to waivers thereafter to be executed; and no reason appears why it did not equally apply to waivers executed prior to the passage of the act. Section 278(d)11 prescribed the period of limitation for the collection of taxes applicable to all cases enumerated in that section and section 277, which expressly included taxes under the Act of 1918. The situations intended to be excluded from the limitations prescribed were carefully specified in section 278(e)12: (1) Assessments \n\n[280 U.S. 453, 468]\n\u00a0\n or collections already barred before the passage of that act and (2) assessments made and proceedings begun prior to that time. Neither of the cases at bar falls within those exceptions. Since, in both cases, assessment and collection were not barred on the enactment of the 1924 Act, and were made after that date, the section is applicable. Compare Russell v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 181\n, 49 S. Ct. 121.\n It is urged that this construction of the acts causes discrimination against taxpayers who obligingly consented to additional time for assessment and collection, and in favor of those who obdurately refused such consent or whose returns were not audited, prior to the bar of the statute, for the purpose of assessing deficiencies. That taxpayers whose returns led to no suspicion of inaccuracy prior to the expiration of the statutory period are in a preferable position is due, not to any unjust discrimination contained in the 1924 or 1926 Acts, but to the quality of their returns and to propitious circumstances. For the disobliging taxpayers, the acts provided an alternative remedy in the so-called jeopardy assessment and demand; 1924,  274(d), 43 Stat. 297, 26 USCA  1051 note; 1926,  279, 44 Stat. 59 (26 USCA  1051). It is urged also that the Government may not properly and consistently accept the consent contained in the 'Waivers' and not be bound by the limitation. But the limitation was only on the corporations' consent; and the Government was bound thereby. The instruments contained nothing, however, which could restrict the Government's power to enlarge the statutory provisions as to limitation. The timeliness of the collection is based, not upon the waivers, but upon the statutes. \n No. 118\n, affirmed.\n No. 414, reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Appeal of Dallas Brass & Copper Co., 3 B.

Brownfield-Canty Carpet Co. (C. C. A.) 31 F.(2d) 89. In the following cases it was held that collection was not barred; the timeliness of the assessment was not questioned: Bank of Commerce v.

Statutes imposing direct taxes have always required taxpayers to file 'lists' or 'schedules' or 'statements' or 'returns' specifying in detail the information requisite for an assessment of the tax. The word 'return' has not always been used. Sometimes it has been used as a synonym for 'list,' 'schedule,' or 'statement.' The specification in the statutes of the prescribed contents of such lists or returns has varied in its detail. But always definite statements of facts were required, from which the tax could be computed.

These public letters from the Commissioner to the Collectors 'and others concerned' were issued February 13, 1919; February 27, 1919. See, also, letters of April 14, 1919, October 3, 1919 and March 17, 1920; and Manual (1920) for the information and guidance of Collectors ,  627, 628. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] This period of limitation on assessments of taxes under the 1918 Act was continued in the later Revenue Acts.

But obviously Form 1031T was not a tentative return within the meaning of this article. It did not even purport to be a 'statement disclosing gross income and the deductions therefrom.' \n[\nFootnote 8\n] To sustain the argument that assessment could be made on the basis of Form 1031T, counsel cited only Matteawan Mfg. Co. v. Commissioner, 14 B. T. A. 789 and Lamborn v. Commissioner, 13 B. T. A. 177, 187. But it is not clear that in either of these cases, the assessment was in fact made on the basis of that form. In both cases there were other bases; and in both cases the Board of Tax Appeals expressly refused to comment on the propriety of assessment based on Form 1031T. See Appeal of Matteawan Mfg. Co., 4 B. T.

CITY OF DECATUR(1930)\nNo. 363\nArgued: Decided: May 19, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 505, 506]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Walter T. Colquitt and Ben J. Conyers, both of Atlanta, Ga., for petitioner.\n Mr. Hooper Alexander, of Atlanta, Ga., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The city of Decatur brought this suit in the superior court of De Kalb county against the Georgia Railway & Electric Company and the Georgia Railway & Power Company. The former was the owner and the latter was the lessee and operator of a system of street \n\n[281 U.S. 505, 507]\n\u00a0\n and suburban railway lines of more than 200 miles serving Atlanta, Decatur, and other places in that part of Georgia. Before, trial, they consolidated and became the Georgia Power Company, and it was made the defendant. The city prayed, and the court granted, a decree permanently enjoining petitioner from violating an ordinance passed by the city March 3, 1903, from violating a contract of April 1, 1903, based upon the ordinance, and from ceasing to operate about a mile of its line in Decatur. The decree was affirmed by the state Supreme Court. 168 Ga. 705, 149 S. E. 32.\n Prior to the commencement of this suit it had been finally adjudged in litigation between the city and petitioner's predecessors that the ordinance and contract bound the carrier not to charge more than five cents per passenger between points on that stretch of track in Decatur and the terminus of the line in Atlanta, and required it upon the payment of each full fare to give to the passenger a transfer ticket that would entitle him for one fare to ride between points on such track and points on any of the carrier's lines in Atlanta. It was also held that the State Railroad Commission was without authority to change rates that are established by contract. Georgia Ry., Etc., Co. v. Railroad Comm., 149 Ga. 1, 98 S. E. 696, 5 A. L. R. 1; Georgia Ry. & Power Co. v. Town of Decatur, 152 Ga. 143, 108 S. E. 615; Georgia Ry. & Power Co. v. Decatur, 153 Ga. 329, 111 S. E. 911; Id., \n262 \nU.S. 432\n, 43 S. Ct. 613. The duration of the defendant's obligation to operate that line or to serve for such contract fare was not determined.\n August 14, 1919, the commission fixed the carrier's fares other than those covered by the contract at six cents; September 22, 1920, it raised them to seven cents, and December 15, 1927, it made them ten cents per passenger, but required the carrier to sell four tickets for thirty cents. The cost of the transportation covered by the contract fare, exclusive of any compensation for the use of prop erty \n\n[281 U.S. 505, 508]\n\u00a0\n employed to furnish the service, exceeds the revenue derived therefrom, and is substantially higher per passenger than the cost of service covered by the fares fixed by the commission. An ordinance of the city of Decatur passed May 15, 1925, directed paving of the streets occupied by the line in question and the assessment of a substantial portion of the cost against the lessee. Thereupon lessor and lessee offered to surrender to the city the permit for the operation of the line and the lessee notified the city that at a time specified it would discontinue the service. The city refused to accept the surrender and promptly brought this suit.\n Petitioner maintained below, and here insists, that the franchise and the rate contract expired August 16, 1919, and that its obligation to operate the line or keep the fivecent fare in force was terminated by such offer and notice. See Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., \n246 \nU.S. 178, 184\n, 38 S. Ct. 278. It contends that the rate is confiscatory, that the decree requires it to operate the line and to serve for the five- cent fare and that, if compelled so to do, it will be deprived of its property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n This court has recently held that the usual permissive charter of a railroad company does not oblige the company to operate its railroad at a loss; that, where it is reasonably certain that future operation will be at a loss, the company, in the absence of contract obligation to continue, may cease, and if in such circumstances the company be compelled by the state to continue to operate at a loss, it would be deprived of its property without due process of law.

We are therefore required to \n\n[281 U.S. 505, 509]\n\u00a0\n pass upon the merits of petitioner's claim. Stearns v. Minnesota, \n179 \nU.S. 223, 232\n, 21 S. Ct. 73; Ward v. Board of County Com'rs of Love County, \n253 \nU.S. 17, 22\n, 40 S. Ct. 419.\n By an Act of the Georgia Legislature passed August 16, 1889 (Acts 1888-89, p. 211) the Collins Park & Belt Railroad Company was incorporated and empowered to construct and operate street railways in Atlanta, in other parts of Fulton county, and in De Kalb and other counties. Subsequently its name was changed to the Atlanta Rapid Transit Company. It applied for, and the town of Decatur by ordinance passed September 4, 1899, granted to it, a 'franchise' to construct and operate the line in question. The act does not specify the term of the company's charter, and there is nothing in it or in the ordinance to fix the duration of the carrier's obligation to operate the line. January 1, 1902, the Georgia Railway & Electric Company was incorporated for the term of 101 years, and was empowered by the act under which it was organized to acquire and operate street and suburban railways. Acts 1892, p. 37. On March 28, 1902, the Atlanta Rapid Transit Company conveyed all its property to the last- mentioned company. March 3, 1903, the town of Decatur by ordinance granted the latter permission to discontinue operation and remove one of its Decatur lines upon the condition that it should continue to operate the stretch of track here involved and 'never charge more than five cents for one fare' for the transportation above described. And April 1, 1903, the town and the company made a contract by which each agreed to do all the things required to be by it performed under the terms of the ordinance. October 16, 1911, the Georgia Railway & Power Company was incorporated as an interurban and street railroad company for the term of 101 years, and January 1, 1912, the Railway & Electric Company leased all its lines of railway and other property to the latter for a term of 999 years. \n\n[281 U.S. 505, 510]\n\u00a0\n It may be assumed, as contended by petitioner, that under the state law (Civ. Code,  2215) the charter of the Collins Park Company expired August 16, 1919, 30 years after passage of the special act, and that it was not bound by its franchise to continue to operate the line after that date. See St. Clair County Turnpike Co. v. Illinois, \n96 U.S. 63\n, 68. The petitioner contends that the ordinance of September 4, 1899, was the only franchise for the operation of the line in question, and that the obligation to operate the line and maintain the contract fare ended with the expiration of the charter of the Collins Park Company.\n But franchises for the construction and operation of street railway lines are granted by the state. And January 1, 1902, the state chartered the Georgia Railway & Electric Company. In this case the Supreme Court held (page 709 of 168 Ga., 149 S. E. 32, 34) that under the state Constitution (Civ. Code,  6448) 'all that towns and cities have to give to the construction of passenger street railways within the limits of the same is the consent of the corporate authorities.' And it held that by the contract of April 1, 1903, the city of Decatur gave its consent for the use of its streets by the Electric Company. We accept that court's construction of the acts of the Legislature and the ordinance and its decision as to the effect of the contract of April 1, 1903. Upon the conveyance by the Atlanta Rapid Transit Company, the system, including the Decatur line in question, passed to the Georgia Railway & Electric Company, to be operated under the franchise granted to that company by the act of the Legislature under which it was incorporated. It is clear that this franchise and the rate contract of April 1, 1903, are still in force.\n There is nothing in the ordinance or contract to indicate a purpose to terminate the obligation of the carrier in respect of the five-cent fare while it continues to operate the line as part of its system under its present franchise (Fort Smith Traction Co. v. Bourland, \n267 \nU.S. 330\n, 45 S. Ct. 249), \n\n[281 U.S. 505, 511]\n\u00a0\n and the contract will continue to bind petitioner during the period intended by the parties unless earlier altered by them or relaxed by state authority (Georgia Ry. Co. v. Decatur, \n262 \nU.S. 432, 438\n, 43 S. Ct. 613). The losses attributable to the stretch of track in question and the five-cent fare are immaterial while the rate contract continues.

Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101\n, 51 S. Ct. 58) affecting spouses who are citizens of the State of Washington.\n Here Koch and his wife filed separate returns for 1927 each returning one-half of the community income; the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed a deficiency on the theory that Koch alone should have returned the entire income; Koch paid under protest, and brought suit against the Collector in the District Court to recover the sum so paid. The Collector demurred. Judgment went for plaintiff. The Collector appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which certified questions to us. This Court ordered the entire record sent up. \n281 \nU.S. 704\n, 50 S. Ct. 462\n\n\n What we said in No. 15 applies here, if under the law of Arizona, the wife's interest in community property is, in legal effect, the same as the Washington. \n\n[282 U.S. 118, 121]\n\u00a0\n The Collector asserts that the Arizona law of community property closely resembles that of California (cf. U. S. v. Robbins, \n269 \nU.S. 315\n, 46 S. Ct. 148); but concedes that in many respects its provisions are similar to those of the law of Washington.\n We have examined the statutes1 and authorities cited, and have concluded that they present no significant differences from the Washington system. In La Tourette v. La Tourette, 15 Ariz. 200, 137 P. 426, 428, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 70, it was said: 'The law makes no distinction between the husband and wife in respect to the right each has in the community property. It gives the husband no higher or better title than it gives the wife. It recognizes a marital community wherein both are equal.' As in Washington, each spouse has unlimited testamentary power over his or her interest in the community, and upon failure to exercise it, such interest passes to the descendants of the decedent.\n The Arizona Supreme Court has likened the community to a partnership. Forsythe v. Paschal, 34 Ariz. 380, 271 P. 865. The husband as agent may not act in fraud of his wife's rights, and if he attempts to do so, she has a remedy in the courts. Gristy v. Hudgens, 23 Ariz. 339, 203 P. 569.\n Enough has been said to show that our conclusion in No. 15 holds here, and that the wife has such equal interest in community income as to entitle her to treat one-half thereof as her income, and file a separate return therefor under sections 210(a) and 211(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 21, 26 USCA  951 note, 952 note).\n Perhaps we ought also to note that what is said in No. 15 with respect to executive construction and legislative history applies in this case. \n\n[282 U.S. 118, 122]\n\u00a0\n For the reasons above given, and more fully stated in the opinion in No. 15, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The applicable provisions (cited from the Revised Statutes of 1913 ( Civil Code) which were in force in 1927) are Title 6, Pars. 403-405, 865- 869, 1102.

Thereafter, pursuant to an order of that court so directing, he brought this suit in equity against Leach & Co., a New York corporation, in the Federal District Court for the Eastern Division of the Northern District of Ohio1, to recover certain mort- \n\n[280 U.S. 351, 354]\n\u00a0\n gage bonds of the Furnace Company, or their value. The District Court gave decree in favor of the Receiver. The Circuit Court of Appeals vacated this decree and dismissed the suit, on the ground that it was beyond the power of the Common Pleas Court to authorize the Receiver to bring it. 27 F.(2d) 201.2\n\n 1. \nThe bonds in question were part of an issue of eight per cent. bonds of the Furnace Company, secured by a mortgage upon certain real and personal property. In 1922 Leach & Co. purchased from the Furnace Company a large number of these bonds, at 90 1\/2 and accrued interest, for which it paid partly in shares the seven per cent preferred stock of the Furnace Company, at 85 and accrued dividends, and partly in cash.\n In 1925 the trustee under the mortgage brought suit in the Common Pleas Court against the Furnace Company for foreclosure. The verified petition alleged that the Furnace Company had defaulted in semi-annual interest on the bonds, and all the outstanding bonds had \n\n[280 U.S. 351, 355]\n\u00a0\n been declared due and payable. It prayed that judgment be given for the amount of the bonds and interest, that the mortgaged property be sold and the proceeds applied to the payment of the outstanding bonds, that a receiver be appointed to take charge of the 'property of the defendant' and manage the same and collect the rents and incomes therefrom, and that he be ordered to set apart and sequester all amounts so received from any of the mortgaged property for the payment of the bonds; and for general relief.\n On the same day a preferred stockholder of the Furnace Company, brought suit in the Common Pleas Court against the Furnace Company and the mortgage trustee. The verified petition alleged that the Furnace Company, owing to prevailing market conditions and want of capital, had been compelled to close down its plant and cease operations, had been unable to pay the semi-annual interest on its bonds, was indebted in the sum of $1, 500,000 on the bonds, had no funds with which to pay the same and accruing interest, was indebted on past due notes and other current obligations in a sum exceeding $2,000,000 which it could not pay, was unable to finance its obligations, and would be subjected to suits, judgments, and executions and the sale of its property and assets, and that for the protection of bondholders, stockholders and creditors of the Company it was necessary that a receiver be appointed to take charge of and conserve its plant and property until its financial requirements could be provided; and prayed that the court appoint a receiver to take charge of its property and assets, and for general relief.\n These causes came on to be heard on the petitions for the appointment of a receiver, whereupon the court consolidated them in so far as the question of the appointment, acts and duties of a receiver were common to both. And, finding that there was urgent exigency for the im- \n\n[280 U.S. 351, 356]\n\u00a0\n mediate appointment of a receiver in the two cases to preserve the property and assets of the Furnace Company, the Court granted the prayers of the petitions, appointed Grant receiver in both cases, and directed and empowered him to take possession of all the property designated in the trustees' petition, together with all other property, both real and personal, of the Furnace Company, including its books and papers, to do all things necessary in order properly to preserve and protect the assets and property for the best interests of all parties interested therein, and to manage and control the same and collect the rents and income therefrom.\n Thereafter Grant applied to the Court for an order granting him as Receiver authority to bring suit in the Federal District Court against Leach & Co., on the ground that it, under an ultra vires and illegal contract, had received bonds of the Furnace Company in exchange for preferred stock; and represented to the Court that he should recover for the benefit of the stockholders and creditors of the Furnace Company the value of such bonds, or the bonds themselves, and that it would be to the material benefit of the stockholders and creditors if leave to commence such suit were granted. Upon hearing this application, the Court, finding that it was for the best interests of the creditors and stockholders of the Funace Company that such suit be commenced, authorized and directed the Receiver to commence the suit against Leach & Co., praying for such relief as should be obtained against it, in order to reimburse the Receiver for the apparent unlawful and illegal issue of the bonds by the Furnace Company to Leach & Co. in consideration of the preferred stock.\n In his petition in the District Court Grant alleged that he was the receiver of all the assets, choses in action and other property of the Furnace Company, duly appointed by the Common Pleas Court, and brought the suit by \n\n[280 U.S. 351, 357]\n\u00a0\n virtue of authority so to do granted to him by that court; and that the Furnace Company was without authority to exchange its bonds for its stock. He prayed that the court order Leach & Co. to surrender and deliver to him the bonds that it had received from the Furnace Company in exchange for the stock, or, if it had disposed of the bonds and could not redeliver them, to pay him their value upon the surrender of the stock; and for general relief. Leach & Co., answering the petition on the merits, admitted that the petitioner was duly appointed receiver of all the assets, choses in action and property of the Furnace Company by the Common Pleas Court, but stated that it had no knowledge or information as to the authority granted to him by that court to bring the action, and therefore neither admitted nor denied that allegation but required the plaintiff to make strict proof thereof. This, we think, under the 30th Equity Rule (33 S. Ct. xxvi)3 put in issue the allegation that the action was brought under authority granted by the Common Pleas Court.\n At the hearing, the District Court, after stating that the plaintiff was the Receiver of the Furnace Company, duly appointed by the Common Pleas Court, and as such possessing all the powers conferred by statute and general principles of equity on a receiver-without referring to the question whether he had been authorized to bring the action4-found, upon the evidence, that the transaction \n\n[280 U.S. 351, 358]\n\u00a0\n by which the bonds were delivered to Leach & Co. violated numerous principles of corporation law, justice and honesty, was a gross fraud upon other preferred stockholders, and could not be sustained against creditors; and, as it appeared that Leach & Co. had disposed of the bonds to innocent purchasers, gave decree against it in favor of the Receiver for their value, with the interest on them that had been paid to Leach & Co.\n On appeal by Leach & Co., the Circuit Court of Appeals held, in substance, that the powers of the Receiver were limited to the purposes of the suit in which he was appointed, and the Common Pleas Court could confer upon him authority to do only such acts as were within the scope of its jurisdiction as limited by such purposes; and that since there was no object or purpose in them that could be served by the bringing of the suit against Leach & Co., the Court was without authority to direct him to bring it, and the purported authorization so to do was beyond its power. And, without passing upon the merits of the receiver's claim, the decree of the District Court was reversed and the suit dismissed.\n\n 2. \nUpon these facts we conclude that the Circuit Court of Appeals was in error in reversing the decree of the District Court and dismissing the Receiver's action, without consideration of his claim upon the merits. While the argument in this Court has covered a wide range, we do not find it necessary to state more than the controlling reasons which lead us to that conclusion.\n The Common Pleas Court by its order had in fact authorized and directed Grant, as receiver, to bring the action in the District Court. The Common Pleas Court had previously appointed him receiver of all the property of the Furnace Company, both real and personal, and had directed and empowered him to take possession thereof and to do all things necessary to preserve and protect it for the best interests of all parties interested therein. \n\n[280 U.S. 351, 359]\n\u00a0\n The claim against Leach & Co. arising out of the exchange of bonds for preferred stock, was a chose in action of the Furnace Company, and as such was a part of the property of which he had been appointed receiver.\n The Common Pleas Court had jurisdiction of the petitions for the appointment of a receiver in the suits of the mortgage trustee and preferred stockholder; and the power to determine whether, under the allegations of the petitions, it was authorized to appoint a receiver of the Company's property; to what extent and for what purposes; and what authority should be vested in him as such receiver.\n Section 11894 of the General Code of Ohio provides that the Common Pleas Court may appoint a receiver in causes pending therein in certain designated cases, and '6. In all other cases in which receivers heretofore have been appointed by the usages of equity.'\n It is questioned whether under this statute the court rightly appointed, under the petition of the mortgage trustee, a receiver of the portion of the Furnace Company's property which was not covered by the mortgage; and it is asserted that under the petition of the preferred stockholder, in which no other relief was prayed, the appointment was erroneous, under the decisions of the Ohio courts. But, however this may be, the court had jurisdiction and the power to determine these questions. And even if the order appointing the receiver was erroneous and might have been vacated in part in a direct attack, as upon an appeal by the Furnace Company, its validity was not challenged in any respect by the answer of Leach & Co. in the District Court, which admitted the allegation that Grant had been 'duly appointed' receiver of all the Company's property. And plainly the validity of the appointment could not have been questioned by a collateral attack in another court. See Cadle v. Baker, 20 Wall. 650, 651; Shields v. Coleman, \n157 \nU.S. 168, 178\n, 15 S. Ct. 570; \n\n[280 U.S. 351, 360]\n\u00a0\n Lively v. Picton (C. C. A.) 218 F. 401, 406; Lydick v. Neville (C. C. A.) 287 F. 479, 482; Olmstead v. Distilling Co. (C. C.) 73 F. 44, 48; Shinney v. North American Co. (C. C.) 97 F. 9, 10; Barbour v. National Bank, 45 Ohio St. 133, 140, 12 N. E. 5; McNary v. Bush, 35 Or. 114, 117, 56 P. 646.\n Section 11897 (Gen. Code Ohio) further provides that 'under the control of the court, the receiver may bring and defend actions in his own name, as receiver, ... and generally do such acts respecting the property as the court authorizes.' Under this provision the Common Pleas Court had jurisdiction to determine what actions the receiver might bring. The action against Leach & Co.-involving in effect the claim of an illegal taking by it of a large amount of the Company's bonds, which if recovered would reduce the amount of the mortgage lien-reduce we think, fairly within the terms of the statute as an act respecting property in the custody of the court in the trustees' suit. But even if this were not the case, the order specifically authorizing and directing the receiver to bring the action in the District Court was one which the Common Pleas Court had jurisdiction to make in the exercise of its discretion and under the construction which it placed upon the statute; and, as such, was not one which, even if erroneous, was subject to the collateral attack which Leach & Co. sought to interpose in the District Court. Thus, in Sanger v. Upton, Assignee, \n91 U.S. 56\n, 58, the District Court, on the application of the assignee of a bankrupt corporation had made an ex parte order that the balance unpaid on the stock of the several stockholders should be paid to the assignee by a certain day, and in default of such payment the assignee should proceed to collect the amount due from each delinquent stockholder. This Court, in a suit instituted by the assignee in the Circuit Court against a stockholder who had failed to pay pursuant to that order, said: 'The order was conclusive as to \n\n[280 U.S. 351, 361]\n\u00a0\n the right of the assignee to bring the suit. Jurisdiction was given to the District Court by the Bankrupt Act ... to make it. It was not necessary that the stockholders should be before the court when it was made, any more than that they should have been there when the decree of bankruptcy was pronounced. That decree gave the jurisdiction and authority to make the order. The plaintiff in error could not, in this action, question the validity of the decree; and, for the same reasons, she could not draw into question the validity of the order. She could not be heard to question either, except by a separate and direct proceeding had for that purpose.'\n\n 3. \nIt is urged, however, in argument that, even if the order of the Common Pleas Court to otherwise valid, Grant is merely a chancery receiver having no title to the property, and therefore cannot maintain an action for its recovery by reason of the settled doctrine in federal jurisprudence that such a receiver has no authority to sue in the courts of a foreign jurisdiction to recover demands or property therein situated, and that his functions and authority are confined to the jurisdiction in which he was appointed. See Sterrett v. Second National Bank, \n248 \nU.S. 73, 76\n, 39 S. Ct. 27, 28, and cases cited. The underlying reason for this rule, as shown in Booth v. Clark, 17 How. 322, 338, and emphasized in Hale v. Allinson, \n188 \nU.S. 56, 68\n, 23 S. Ct. 244, 249, is that such a receiver 'has no extraterritorial power of official action; none which the court appointing him can confer, with authority to enable him to go into a foreign jurisdiction to take possession of the debtor's property; none which can give him, upon the principle of comity, a privilege to sue in a foreign court of another jurisdiction.' It has been applied by this Court in cases where a chancery receiver appointed by a State court sought to maintain a suit in a Federal court in another State; its effect there being as appears from a statement in Hale v. Allin \n\n[280 U.S. 351, 362]\n\u00a0\n son, supra, at page 68 of 188 U. S., 23 S. Ct. 244, 249, merely to deny permission to such an action by a receiver, 'outside the jurisdiction of the state of his appointment.'\n Here, however, the Ohio court authorized and directed the Receiver to bring the action in a Federal District Court within Ohio, and having jurisdiction in territory within which the Common Pleas Court itself was located. \n5\n The receiver's petition merely prayed for a recovery against Leach & Co., and did not seek an administration of the property by the District Court. Upon such recovery no assets would have to be removed from the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court to Ohio, the State of the receiver's appointment, as they would be recovered and held therein. The order did not authorize or require the receiver to take any extra- territorial action outside of Ohio, either for the purpose of bringing the suit or taking possession of the property recovered; and the bringing of the action within Ohio involved no application to the District Court to be granted the privilege of bringing a suit outside of Ohio upon the principle of comity. We think that under these circumstances the Federal court in the same State cannot rightly be considered a court of foreign jurisdiction within the meaning of the general rule, and that there is no substantial ground for extending that rule, as hitherto applied, so as to bring this case within its terms.\n This conclusion is emphasized by the fact that in Shields v. Coleman, supra, page 174 of 157 U. S., 15 S. Ct. 570, a receiver appointed by a chancery court of a Tennessee county, was allowed, without question, pursuant to its order, to maintain an action in the United States Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee-within whose territorial limits that county was included-for the restoration of property then in the custody of a receiver appointed by the Fed \n\n[280 U.S. 351, 363]\n\u00a0\n eral court. Similar action was taken by this Court in Harkin v. Brundage, \n276 \nU.S. 36, 42\n, 48 S. Ct. 268, in a proceeding by receivers appointed by the Superior Court of Cook County, Illinois, brought in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. And, conversely, it was held in Shull v. Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 81 W. Va. 184, 188, 94 S. E. 123, that a receiver appointed by a Federal District Court in West Virginia, might maintain an action in a Circuit Court of the same State, under authority from the Federal court, not being under such circumstances 'a foreign receiver' nor proceeding outside of the jurisdiction of his appointment.\n\n 4. \nAs the view of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the Receiver was without authority to bring the action against Leach & Co. was erroneous, its judgment must be reversed. And since it did not determine the merits of the Receiver's claim, the case will be remanded to that court with instructions to proceed to that end in conformity with this opinion. See Buzynski v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., \n277 \nU.S. 226, 228\n, 48 S. Ct. 440, 441, and cases cited.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Mahoning County is included in the Eastern Division of the Northern District, and a stated term of the District Court is held therein. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The record here consists in part of copies of orders and proceedings in the Common Pleas Court, which were filed in the Circuit Court of Appeals, for its consideration, pursuant to a stipulation of the parties. The Circuit Court of Appeals, after stating that no issue had been made in the evidence in the District Court as to the receiver's authority to bring the action, said: 'We preferred not to decide it upon a construction of the pleadings, and hence we suggested to counsel that they file certified copies of any orders or proceedings had in the common pleas court, where the receiver was appointed, and stipulate that this court might consider such orders or proceedings in determining the question on it merits. This suggestion has been acted upon, and certified copies of all pertinent pleadings and orders have been field.'

Averments other than of value or amount of damage, if not denied, shall be deemed confessed, except as against an infant, lunatic, or other person non compos and not under guardianship. ...' \n[\nFootnote 4\n] No evidence had been offered upon this issue in the District Court; but the absence was fully supplied, by concurrence of both parties, in the Circuit Court of Appeals.

PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF OHIO(1930)\nNo. 491\nArgued: Decided: May 19, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 470, 471]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John F. Carlisle, of Columbus, Ohio, and Andrew Wilson, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Messrs. Gilbert Bettman, of Cincinnati, Ohio, and A. R. Johnson, Jr., of Washington, D. C., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 470, 472]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant applied to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio for a certificate to operate, solely in interstate commerce, a line of passenger motor busses over certain public highways in that State as part of an intended route between Columbus, Ohio, and Huntington, W. Va. In his application he described the route as including a short loop at Portsmouth, Ohio, whereby the busses on reaching that point would cross the Ohio River to a village at the Kentucky end of the interstate bridge and then recross to Portsmouth before proceeding towards their destination. Several carriers likely to be affected if the application was granted intervened and filed protests. A hearing was had, after which the Commission made an order granting the requested certificate, but excluding the loop at Portsmouth from the intended route-the exclusion being put in the form of an express prohibition,1 and the commission explaining that in its opinion the loop was intended to be merely a device to enable the appellant to carry passengers between Portsmouth and other points in Ohio and, by giving that service the appearance of an interstate service, to avoid compliance with the laws of that state relating to intrastate motor transportation. A rehearing was sought by the appellant because the loop at Portsmouth was excluded, and by the protestants because the certificate was granted; but the Commission adhered to its order.\n The appellant then brought a suit in equity against the Commission in the District Court of the United States for \n\n[281 U.S. 470, 473]\n\u00a0\n the Southern District of Ohio to restrain and prevent the enforcement of so much of the order as excluded from the intended route the loop at Portsmouth. The protestants and some police officers who might be called on to assist in enforcing the order were made codefendants with the Commission. The parties were all citizens of Ohio, and the sole ground advanced for invoking the jurisdiction of the federal court was that the suit was one arising under the Constitution of the United States and involving more than $3,000. See sections 41(1) and 380, Title 28, U. S. Code (28 USCA  41(1), 380).\n In the bill so much of the order as excluded the loop at Portsmouth was assailed as an attempted restriction and regulation of interstate commerce by a state agency contrary to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States (art. 1,  8, cl. 3) and to section 614- 101 of the General Code of Ohio, and as denying to the appellant rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The prayer was for both an interlocutory and a permanent injunction to be granted conformably to section 380, Title 28, U. S. Code (28 USCA  380).\n Three judges were called pursuant to that section to act in the suit; an interlocutory injunction was granted; and upon the final hearing there was a decree dissolving the injunction and dismissing the bill upon the ground that in a litigating between the same parties, had in the Supreme Court of Ohio while the suit in the District Court was pending, the Commission's order had been adjudged valid, and that the appellant was barred and estopped by that adjudication from further litigating the same matter. 33 F.(2d) 323. After the decree was entered, the appellant sought and the District Court allowed a direct appeal to this Court under sections 345 and 380, Title 28, U. S. Code (28 USCA  345, 380).\n The appellees now have interposed a motion, under subdivision 4 of rule 7 of the Rules of this court (28 USCA  354), that the \n\n[281 U.S. 470, 474]\n\u00a0\n decree be affirmed without awaiting oral argument upon the ground that the objections taken to the decree are so unsubstantial as not to admit of debate; and the parties have submitted full briefs in this connection.\n The laws of Ohio make provision for a review of final orders of the Commission by the Supreme Court of the state-a judicial review culminating in a judgment. Gen. Code,  544, 545; Hocking Valley Ry. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 92 Ohio St. 9, 14, 110 N. E. 521, L. R. A. 1918A, 267, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 1154; Hocking Valley Ry. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 100 Ohio St. 321, 323, 126 N. E. 397; Ohio Utilities Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n267 \nU.S. 359\n, 45 S. Ct. 259.\n Shortly after the Commission denied their respective applications for a rehearing, the appellant and the protestants by two distinct petitions sought and obtained a review of the Commission's order by the Supreme Court of the state-the appellant complaining of the exclusion of the loop at Portsmouth, and the protestants of the granting of the certificate. The Commission was made a party defendant to both petitions, and the petitions were consolidated and heard together. Thus the court had before it the entire order, the Commission, the appellant, and the protestants. In that court the appellant charged in his petition that so much of the order as excluded the loop from the intended route was unlawful and should be reversed upon the grounds, among others, that it was not sustained by the evidence, denied to the appellant rights, privileges, and immunities guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, was in conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, and was in violation of section 614-101 of the General Code of Ohio. The grounds on which the protestants challenged the order are only obscurely indicated in the present record-possibly because having no bearing here. \n\n[281 U.S. 470, 475]\n\u00a0\n After a hearing in which all of the parties participated the state court rendered a judgment sustaining and affirming the Commission's order in its entirely. 119 Ohio St. 264, 163 N. E. 713, 715. No effort was made to have the judgment reviewed by this court, and after the three months allotted for applying for such a review had elapsed, the defendants in the suit in the District Court, by leave of that court, interposed answers setting up the judgment as a bar to the further prosecution of the suit. A hearing upon this plea resulted in the decree now under review, which sustained the plea and dismissed the bill.\n The case in the state court was so far identical with the suit in the federal court as respects subject matter and parties that there can be no doubt that the judgment in the former, unless invalidated by some jurisdictional infirmity, operated to bar the further prosecution of the latter. That the state court had jurisdiction of the parties is plain and not questioned. But the appellant does question that it had jurisdiction of the subject-matter; and this although at the outset he treated that jurisdiction as subsisting and invoked its exercise. Of course, he is entitled to raise this question notwithstanding his prior inconsistent attitude, for jurisdiction of the subject-matter must arise by law and not by mere consent. We turn therefore to the grounds on which that jurisdiction is questioned.\n The appellant relies on the commerce clause of the Constituion as in some way operating to commit to the federal courts and to withhold from the state courts jurisdiction of all suits relating to the regulation or attempted regulation of interstate commerce. This view of that clause is quite inadmissible. It has no support in any quarter; is at variance with the actual practice in this class of litigation, Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1; Western \n\n[281 U.S. 470, 476]\n\u00a0\n Union Telegraph Co. v. Foster, \n247 \nU.S. 105\n, 38 S. Ct. 438, 1 A. L. R. 1278; Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, 225 N. Y. 397, 122 N. E. 260; Id., \n252 \nU.S. 23\n, 40 S. Ct. 279; People's Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n270 \nU.S. 550\n, 46 S. Ct. 371; Public Utilities Commission v. Attleboro Co., \n273 \nU.S. 83\n, 47 S. Ct. 294; Murray v. Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co. (C. C.) 62 F. 24, 42, 43; and is in conflict with the doctrine often sustained by this court that the state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction of suits of a civil nature arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, save in exceptional instances where the jurisdiction has been restricted by Congress to the federal courts. Claflin v. Houseman, \n93 \nU.S. 130, 136\n, 137 S.; Robb v. Connolly, \n111 U.S. 624\n, 635-637, 4 S. Ct. 544; Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 56\n, 57 S., 32 S. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44; Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Bombolis, \n241 \nU.S. 211, 221\n, 223 S., 36 S. Ct. 595, Ann. Cas. 1916E, 505, L. R. A. 1917A, 86. There is no such restriction which is applicable here.\n It next is said that the suit in the federal court was begun before resort was had to the state court, and therefore that the jurisdiction of the federal court was exclusive and precluded action in the state court. In this the appellant is invoking a rule which is applicable to suits dealing with specific property and involving actual or potential control over the same, where necessarily the court (whether federal or state) first obtaining jurisdiction of the res must hold it to the exclusion of another. Here the litigation was not of that class, but was of such a nature that it could proceed in both courts, in virtue of their concurrent jurisdiction, until there was a final judgment in one, Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226\n, 43 S. Ct. 79, 24 A. L. R. 1077, when that judgment would become conclusive in the other as res judicata. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Schendel, \n270 \nU.S. 611, 616\n, 46 S. Ct. 420, 53 A. L. R. 1265; Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Harris, \n97 U.S. 331\n, 336.\n By way of further questioning the state court's jurisdiction, it is said that the state statutes, rightly under \n\n[281 U.S. 470, 477]\n\u00a0\n stood, do not invest that court with power to review orders of the Commission relating to interstate commerce, but only such as relate to other subjects, sections 502, 614-89, 614-101 of the Ohio General Code being cited. And by way of questioning that court's power to render the judgment in question, it is said that the state statute, section 544, General Code, although distinctly empowering the court to reverse, vacate, or modify orders of the Commission found unlawful or unreasonable, contains no provision for an affirmance of those not so found. The powers of the state court in these particulars are questions of local law only. That court resolved them against the present contentions, for it both reviewed and affirmed the order. And that resolution is in accord with its earlier and later rulings. Cannon Ball Transportation Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 113 Ohio St. 565, 149 N. E. 713; Detroit-Cincinnati Coach Line, Inc., v. Public Utilities Commission, 119 Ohio St. 324, 164 N. E. 356; Wheeling Traction Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 119 Ohio St. 481, 164 N. E. 523. Plainly its solution of these questions of local law must be accepted as controlling in this court, as they were in the District Court. Standard Oil Co. v. Missouri, \n224 \nU.S. 270, 281\n, 32 S. Ct. 406, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 936; Gasquet v. Lapeyre, \n242 \nU.S. 367, 369\n, 37 S. Ct. 165; Iowa Central Ry. Co. v. Iowa, \n160 \nU.S. 389, 393\n, 16 S. Ct. 344.\n In the opinion of the state court there is no express mention of the constitutional grounds on which the appellant asked a reversal of the order excluding the loop over the Ohio River at Portsmouth; and from this it is argued that the constitutional validity of the order was not determined, and therefore as to that matter the judgment is not res judicata. But the argument is not sound. The question of the constitutional validity of the order was distinctly presented by the appellant's petition and necessarily was resolved against him by the judgment affirming the order. Omitting to mention that question in the opinion did not eliminate it from the case or \n\n[281 U.S. 470, 478]\n\u00a0\n make the judgment of affirmance any the less an adjudication of it. But while the opinion makes no specific reference to the attack on the constitutional validity of the order, it leaves no doubt that the court regarded that and other objections to the order as untenable, and on that basis affirmed it; for in the opinion the court says, 'The finding of fact by the commission as to the intent and purpose of Grubb in seeking this side loop from Portsmouth to South Portsmouth and return was amply sustained by the records of the commission, and we see no error in the action of the commission denying that part of the application.'\n In his bill the appellant assails the validity of the order upon one ground not brought to the attention of the state court-a ground arising out of the granting to another interstate motor line of a certificate to operate busses over a route including the loop at Portsmouth; and he insists that this ground of objection is not concluded by the judgment of the state court, and therefore is open to examination and adjudication upon its merits by the District Court. But the judgment has a broader operation as res judicata than is thus suggested. The certificate referred to was granted several months before the appellant applied for a certificate and he had personal knowledge of it from the time it was granted. It was shown upon the records of the Commission and was easily accessible when the hearing was had upon his application. Thus it is a matter which, if having the bearing now suggested, could have been brought to the attention of the Commission either at that hearing or in his request for a rehearing, section 543, General Statutes; and, if it was not then given proper effect, he could have brought it to the attention of the state court and have made the same claim in respect of it that is now made in his bill.\n The thing presented for adjudication in the case in the state court was the validity of the order, and it was in cumbent \n\n[281 U.S. 470, 479]\n\u00a0\n on the appellant to present in support of his asserted right of attack every available ground of which he had knowledge. He was not at liberty to prosecute that right by piecemeal, as by presenting a part only of the available grounds and reserving others for another suit, if failing in that. Werlein v. New Orleans, \n177 U.S. 390\n, 398, et seq., 20 S. Ct. 682; United States v. California & Oregon Land Co., \n192 \nU.S. 355, 358\n, 24 S. Ct. 266.\n As the ground just described was available but not put forward the appellant must abide the rule that a judgment upon the merits in one suit is res judicata in another where the parties and subject-matter are the same, not only as respects matters actually presented to sustain or defeat the right asserted, but also as respects any other available matter which might have been presented to that end. Baltimore S. S. Co. v. Phillips, \n274 \nU.S. 316, 319\n, 47 S. Ct. 600; United States v. Moser, \n266 \nU.S. 236, 241\n, 45 S. Ct. 66; Cromwell v.

The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff and the judgment thereon was affirmed in the Court of Appeals. 58 App. D. C. 304, 30 F.(2d) 467, 469.\n At the close of all the evidence defendant moved the court to direct the jury to return a verdict in his favor. He maintained that the evidence failed to show that plaintiff was injured by the negligence alleged and that it left the cause of her injury in the realm of conjecture. The motion was denied. Defendant sought reversal on that ground. And that is the only ruling of which complaint was made in the petition for this writ.\n An opinion written by the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals held that the motion accepted as true plaintiff's evidence together with all inferences reasonably deducible from it, and that the motion could be granted only when all reasonable men could 'draw but one conclusion from it and that conclusion utterly opposed to the plaintiff's right to recover.' He cited Railroad Co. v. Carrington, 3 App. D. C. 101, 108; Warthen v. Hammond, 5 App. D. C. 167, 173; Adams v. Railroad Co., 9 App. D. C. 26, 30; Glaria v. Washington Southern R. Co., 30 App. D. C. 559, 563; Catholic University v. Waggaman, 32 App. D. C. 307, 320, and Chesapeake Beach R. Co. v. Brez, 39 App. D. C. 58, 69.\n There was a concurring opinion by one of the associate justices and dissent by the other. The concurring justice held that under the strict rule adopted in that court there was sufficient evidence to carry the case to the jury. He said at page 470 of 30 F.(2d): 'It is a mere travesty to say that the court is bound to send the case to the jury, if there is any evidence tending to support the contention of the plaintiff, and shut its eyes to the justice or injustice of a verdict resting upon such a filmsy basis. It is my fixed opinion, as \n\n[281 U.S. 90, 93]\n\u00a0\n expressed on many occasions, that the rule established in the decisions referred to, and in many other decisions of this court, is too strict, and should be modified to the extent of confiding in the court the power to determine whether or not the evidence is sufficient to raise a reasonable issue of fact, capable of supporting a verdict that will meet the substantial ends of justice. I trust that such a rule of procedure may yet be adopted by the unanimous concurrence of the justices of this court, as will lift the trial justice in this district from a mere automaton to the exercise of his lawful and proper judicial function of seeing that cases are submitted to juries in accordance with such lawful rules of procedure as will elicit verdicts based upon substantial issues of fact rather than mere caprice and sympathy.' The dissenting justice found in the evidence 'no basis whatever for the verdict and judgment.'\n'When, on the trial of the issues of fact in an action at law before a Federal court and a jury, the evidence, with all the inferences that justifiably could be drawn from it, does not constitute a sufficient basis for a verdict for the plaintiff or the defendant, as the case may be, so that such a verdict, if returned, would have to be set aside, the court may and should direct a verdict for the other party.' Slocum v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n228 \nU.S. 364, 369\n, 33 S. Ct. 523, 525. 1 \n\n[281 U.S. 90, 94]\n\u00a0\n A mere scintilla of evidence is not enough to require the submission of an issue to the jury. The decisions establish a more reasonable rule 'that in every case, before the evidence is left to the jury, there is a preliminary question for the judge, not whether there is literally no evidence, but whether there is any upon which a jury can properly proceed to find a verdict for the party producing it, upon whom the onus of proof is imposed.' Improvement Company v. Munson, 14 Wall. 442, 448; Pleasants v. Fant, 22 Wall. 116, 122.\n\n Issues that depend on the credibility of witnesses, and the effect or weight of evidence, are to be decided by the jury. And in determining a motion of either party for a peremptory instruction, the court assumes that the evidence for the opposing party proves all that it reasonably may be found sufficient to establish, and that from such facts there should be drawn in favor of the latter all the inferences that fairly are deducible from them. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Cox, \n145 \nU.S. 593, 606\n, 12 S. Ct. 905; Gardner v. Michigan Central Railroad, \n150 \nU.S. 349, 360\n, 14 S. Ct. 140; Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Groeger, \n266 \nU.S. 521, 524\n, 527 S., 45 S. Ct. 169. Where uncertainty as to the existence of negligence arises from a conflict in the testimony or because, the facts being undisputed, fair-minded men will honestly draw different conclusions from them, the question is not one of law but of fact to be settled by the jury. Richmond & Danville Railroad v. Powers, \n149 U.S. 43\n, 45 13 S. Ct. 748.\n Where the evidence upon any issue is all on one side or so overwhelmingly on one side as to leave no room to doubt what the fact is, the court should give a peremptory instruction to the jury. People's Saving Bank v. Bates, \n120 \nU.S. 556, 562\n, 7 S. Ct. 679; Southern Pacific Company v. Pool, \n160 \nU.S. 438, 440\n, 16 S. Ct. 338. 'When a plaintiff produces evidence that is consistent with an hypothesis that the defendant is not negligent, and also with one that he is, his proof tends to establish neither.' Ewing v. Goode (by Taft, \n\n[281 U.S. 90, 95]\n\u00a0\n Circuit Judge) 78 F. 442, 444 (C. C.). See Patton v. Texas & Pacific Railway Co., \n179 \nU.S. 658, 663\n, 21 S. Ct. 275; New York Central R. R. Co. v. Ambrose, \n280 \nU.S. 486\n, 50 S. Ct. 198.\n The burden was on plaintiff to establish the negligence and injury alleged; and, if the evidence failed adequately to support either element, defendant's motion should have been granted. We need not consider whether the opinion written by the Chief Justice could be sustained if it stood alone. The concurrence was essential to the judgment. The concurring opinion rests upon the conception that the rule stated by the Chief Justice required denial of defendant's motion if plaintiff's claims were supported by any evidence, however slight. That is not the rule applied in federal courts. But it does follow that a verdict should have been directed for the defendant. It remains to be considered whether, having regard to the applicable rules established by the decisions of this court, the evidence was sufficient to warrant a finding by the jury that defendant was negligent as charged and thereby injured plaintiff.\n It is not claimed by plaintiff that defendant knowingly put acid in her ears, but that he negligently did so while intending to apply oil. She gave testimony that tends to show the following facts: Prior to defendant's treatment her hearing was good and she never had any disease or injury in or about either ear. She first consulted defendant on Saturday, October 21, 1922. He treated her throat. On the following Monday defendant told her that there was something wrong with her nose and that mouth breathing had made her throat sore. He treated her nose. On Wednesday she told defendant she had some cold and felt wax or something in her right ear. He examined it and said there was nothing wrong. She repeated that she felt wax in it. He then said that he would put some mineral oil in her ears. There were several small white bottles and a dropper on a cabinet in his \n\n[281 U.S. 90, 96]\n\u00a0\n office. He took the dropper from one of the bottles and put some liquid in her right ear. She immediately suffered much pain, became dizzy and heard great noises in that ear. He then put some of the liquid in her left ear. She experienced the same sensations, became very ill, and lost control of her body. Other evidence shows that she went or was taken to a bed in defendant's house and there remained for some hours and until a friend came and took her to her mother's home.\n There was testimony given by plaintiff's mother and sister that, up to the time defendant treated her ears, plaintiff's hearing was good; that she never had any disease or injury of the ears; that, when she was brought from defendant's office, she was very ill, apparently suffered much pain, remained in bed for about two days, and was deaf. On the Friday following defendant's last treatment she was taken to Dr. Patten, a specialist. He treated her daily for some months and two or three times a week until October, 1926. Then Dr. Morgan treated her twice a week until the time of the trial. Neither Dr. Patten nor Dr. Morgan testified at the trial. The record shows that the former could not be called, but it is silent as to the latter.\n In 1923 Dr. Crisp, treating her for something else, casually examined her ears. He found the drum of the right ear broken and that of the left ear inflamed. In 1925, after the commencement of this action, at the request of the defendant, Dr. Allen was permitted to examine the plaintiff. He found both eardrums retracted and a perforation in the right but none in the left. Early in 1927, in preparation for the trial, plaintiff had Dr. Gill examine her ears. He found practically all of the right and about half of the left drum gone and that she had one-third hearing in the right and two-fifths in the left ear. He gave testimony to the effect that, if applied \n\n[281 U.S. 90, 97]\n\u00a0\n to them, acid would injure or destroy eardrums and would cause pain and possibly other sensations like those which plaintiff testified she suffered at the time of the treatment.\n Defendant testified plaintiff told him her hearing had become impaired and that her ears had been treated. He found both eardrums perforated. On her last visit she was nauseated and complained of dizziness and roaring in her head. He dropped mineral oil into her ears with a dropper to close up the external ears in order to prevent noise from penetrating into the middle ears. The noise subsided, she became composed, went to a bed in his house, and remained until taken home by a friend. He denied that he put acid in her ears and testified that he never had any in his office.\n The evidence shows that, while difficult to do, it would be possible by means of a dropper to apply acid to eardrums without allowing it to come into contact with other tissues. There was no scar or anything to indicate that acid had touched any part of the canal leading to either eardrum. Plainly it would have been impossible for defendant to have closed the external ears without allowing the liquid used for that purpose to touch the canal tissue. But plaintiff was not required specifically to show what defendant did put in her ear or that the treatment destroyed either of her eardrums or made her deaf. If the evidence was sufficient to justify a finding that defendant negligently put a harmful fluid in her ears causing her pain and injury, the motion was properly denied.\n As the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony are for the jury, plaintiff's testimony as to the treatment and immediate effect upon her and the testimony of others as to her condition shortly afterwards constituted sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that instead of oil defendant negligently put some \n\n[281 U.S. 90, 98]\n\u00a0\n harmful liquid into her ears thereby causing her pain, suffering and some injury in and about her ears. It was not necessary for the trial court in passing upon the motion to determine, and we need not consider, whether under the rules laid down in the decisions of this court the evidence was sufficient to warrant a finding that the perforation of either eardrum or permanent deafness resulted from defendant's treatment.\n Defendant seeks reversal on a number of grounds that were not mentioned in his petition for the writ. But this court is not called on to consider any question not raised by the petition. Webster Co. v. Splitdorf Co., \n264 \nU.S. 463, 464\n, 44 S. Ct. 342.\n Judgment affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] And see Phoenix Ins. Co. v.

RUTHERFORD COUNTY(1930)\nNo. 270\nArgued: March 5, 1930Decided: April 14, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 121, 122]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Willis Smith and Murray Allen, both of Raleigh, N. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Clyde R. Hoey, of Shelby, N. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Henrietta Mills, a corporation of North Carolina, brought this suit in the District Court of the United States to enjoin Rutherford county, in that state, from collecting a tax upon the property of the corporation for the year 1927, or for any subsequent year, based upon any valuation in excess of sixty per cent. of the actual and fair market value. It was alleged that the enforcement of such a tax would deprive the corporation of its property without due process of law and deny the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.\n The bill of complaint charged that the actual value, in the sense of the applicable statutory provision of the state, of the property of the corporation in Rutherford \n\n[281 U.S. 121, 123]\n\u00a0\n county on May 1, 1927, did not exceed $1,887,352, but that the property was actually assessed at $2,637,819. The corporation complained to the county commissioners, as the constituted board of equalization and review, but the board declined to pass upon the questions presented. The corporation then appealed to the state board of assessment which, after hearing, reduced the assessment by the sum of $275,000 and fixed the value of the property at $2,362,819. The bill alleged that the tax officials of the county and of the state had intentionally and arbitrarily valued the complainant's property greatly in excess of its true value, while at the same time they had fixed the value of all other assessable property within the county at only sixty per cent. of its true value; that the assessment of complainant's property should have been reduced in like proportion, that is, to $1,132,411.20; and that the complainant had paid to the county a sum which would be equal to the tax if laid upon such a valuation.\n The answer denied that there had been any arbitrary and intentional overvaluation, or any unlawful discrimination against the complainant, and alleged that the complainant had an adequate remedy at law.\n The District Court decided against the complainant upon both these grounds and dismissed the bill of complaint. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 32 F.(2d) 570.\n Section 16 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 (1 Stat. 82) provided 'That suits in equity shall not be sustained in either of the courts of the United States, in any case where plain, adequate and complete remedy may be had at law.' This explicit prohibition, continued in section 723 of the Revised Statutes and section 267 of the Judicial Code (U. S. C. tit. 28,  384 (28 USCA  384)), has clear application to proceedings to enjoin the collection of taxes upon the ground that they are illegal or unconstitutional. It must \n\n[281 U.S. 121, 124]\n\u00a0\n appear that the enforcement of the tax would cause irreparable injury, or that there are other special circumstances bringing the case under some recognized head of equity jurisdiction, before the aid of a federal court of equity can be invoked. The mere fact that the validity of the tax may be tested more conveniently by a bill in equity than by an action at law does not justify resort to the former. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n In the present case, a distinction is sought to be taken upon the ground that a statute of North Carolina gives a right to proceed in equity, and it is argued that a similar right should be recognized by the federal court. Section 7979 of the Consolidated Statutes of North Carolina provides:\n'Unless a tax or assessment, or some part thereof, be illegal or invalid, ... or assessed for an illegal or unauthorized purpose, no injunction shall be granted by any court of judge to restrain the collection thereof in whole or in part, nor to restrain the sale of any property for the nonpayment thereof; nor shall any court issue any order in claim and delivery proceedings or otherwise for the taking of any personalty levied on by the sheriff to enforce payment of such tax or assessment against the \n\n[281 U.S. 121, 125]\n\u00a0\n owner thereof. Whenever any person shall claim to have a valid defense to the enforcement of a tax or assessment charged or assessed upon his property or poll, such person shall pay such tax or assessment to the sheriff; but if, at the time of such payment, he shall notify the sheriff in writing that he pays the same under protest, such payment shall be without prejudice to any defenses or rights he may have in the premises, and he may, at any time within thirty days after such payment, demand the same in writing from the treasurer of the state or of the county, city, or town, for the benefit or under the authority or by request of which the same was levied; and if the same shall not be refunded within ninety days thereafter, may sue such county, city, or town, for the amount so demanded, including in his action against the county both state and county tax; and if upon the trial it shall be determined that such tax or any part thereof was levied or assessed for an illegal or unauthorized purpose, or was for any reason invalid or excessive, judgment shall be rendered therefor, with interest, and the same shall be collected as in other cases. The amount of state taxes for which judgment shall be rendered in such action shall be refunded by the state treasurer.' Laws of 1901, c. 558,  30.\n\n The Supreme Court of North Carolina, in Norfolk-Southern Railroad Company v. Board of Commissioners, 188 N. C. 265, 266, 124 S. E. 560, made the following statement as to the procedure in the state courts:\n'In this jurisdiction a taxpayer may contest the validity of an assessment or collection of tax upon his property in one of two ways:\n\n'(1) He may pay the alleged illegal or invalid tax under protest, and then bring an action to recover it back, observing, of course, the requirements of the statute with respect to time, notice, etc. C. S.  7979; Murdock v. \n\n[281 U.S. 121, 126]\n\u00a0\n Com'rs, 138 N. C. 124, 50 S. E. 567; Hilliard v. Asheville, 118 N. C. 845, 24 S. E. 738; Schaul v. Charlotte, 118 N. C. 733, 24 S. E. 526; Range Co. v. Carver, 118 N. C. 328, 24 S. E. 352.\n\n'(2) He may, if the tax or assessment or some part thereof be illegal or invalid, or be levied or assessed for an illegal or unauthorized purpose, apply for injunctive relief without paying the alleged illegal or invalid tax in advance.

E. 534.'3\n\n If it be assumed that, under the state statutes, the complainant could have applied to the state court for an injunction, the complainant also had an adequate remedy at law. Schaul v. Charlotte, 118 N. C. 733, 24 S. E. 526; Teeter v. Wallace, 138 N. C. 264, 267, 50 S. E. 701; Blackwell v. City of Gastonia, 181 N. C. 378, 107 S. E. 218; Brunswick-Balke- Collender Company v. Mecklenburg County, 181 N. C. 386, 107 S. E. 317; Carstarphen v. Plymouth, 186 N. C. 90, 118 S. E. 905. This is not a matter of doubt, as in Union Pacific Railroad Company v. Weld County, \n247 \nU.S. 282, 285\n, 38 S. Ct. 510, and Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company v. Doughton, \n262 \nU.S. 413, 426\n, 43 S. Ct. 620. The act of Congress with respect to the existence of such a remedy has reference to the adequacy of the remedy on the law side of the Federal courts (Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466, 516\n, 18 S. Ct. 418; Chicago, B. & Q. Railroad Company v. Osborne, \n265 \nU.S. 14, 16\n, 44 S. Ct. 431; Risty v. Chicago, R. I. & P. Railway Com- \n\n[281 U.S. 121, 127]\n\u00a0\n pany, \n270 \nU.S. 378, 388\n, 46 S. Ct. 236) and in this case there would have been an adequate remedy at law, not only in the state court, but also in the federal court, if petitioner had been able to show a violation of the Federal Constitution (Judicial Code,  24 (28 USCA  41 )).\n The contention is that the state statute authorizing a proceeding in the state court for an injunction created an equitable right which should be enforced in the federal court. It is true that, where a state statute creates a new equitable right of a substantive character, which can be enforced by proceedings in conformity with the pleadings and practice appropriate to a court of equity, such enforcement may be had in a federal court, provided a ground exists for invoking the federal jurisdiction. Clark v. Smith, 13 Pet. 195, 203; In re Broderick's Will, 21 Wall. 503, 520; Holland v. Challen, \n110 \nU.S. 15, 24\n, 25 S., 3 S. Ct. 495; Frost v. Spitley, \n121 \nU.S. 552, 557\n, 7 S. Ct. 1129; Gormley v. Clark, \n134 \nU.S. 338, 348\n, 10 S. Ct. 554; Lawson v. United States Mining Company, \n207 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 28 S. Ct. 15; Pusey & Jones Company v. Hanssen, \n261 \nU.S. 491, 498\n, 43 S. Ct. 454. But the enforcement in the federal courts of new equitable rights created by states is subject to the qualification that such enforcement must not impair any right conferred, or conflict with any inhibition imposed, by the constitution or laws of the United States. This court said in Scott v. Neely, \n140 \nU.S. 106, 110\n, 11 S. Ct. 712, 714, that 'whenever, respecting any right violated, a court of law is competent to render a judgment affording a plain, adequate, and complete remedy, the party aggrieved must seek his remedy in such court, not only because the defendant has a constitutional right to a trial by jury, but because of the prohibition of the act of congress to pursue his remedy in such cases in a court of equity.' Whitehead v. Shattuck, \n138 \nU.S. 146, 152\n, 11 S. Ct. 276; Wehrman v. Conklin, \n155 \nU.S. 314, 323\n, 15 S. Ct. 129. Whatever uncertainty may have arisen because of expressions which did not fully accord \n\n[281 U.S. 121, 128]\n\u00a0\n with the rule as thus stated,4 the distinction, with respect to the effect of state legislation, has come to be clearly established between substantive and remedial rights. A state statute of a mere remedial character, such as that which the petitioner invokes, cannot enlarge the right to proceed in a federal court sitting in equity, and the federal court may therefore be obliged to deny an equitable remedy which the plaintiff might have had in a state court. Pusey & Jones v. Hanssen, supra.\n The provision of the act of Congress does not extend to the jurisdiction of the federal court, but governs the proceedings in equity, and, unless the case is one where the objection may be treated as waived by the party entitled to raise it, the prohibition is not to be disregarded. Reynes v. Dumont, \n130 \nU.S. 354, 395\n, 9 S. Ct. 486; Singer Sewing Machine Company v. Benedict, \n229 \nU.S. 481, 484\n, 33 S. Ct. 942; American Mills Company v. American Surety Company, \n260 \nU.S. 360, 363\n, 43 S. Ct. 149. There was no waiver in the present case, and, as the petitioner had an adequate remedy at law, the District Court could not properly entertain the suit.\n Decree affirmed without prejudice to proceedings at law. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Dows v.

LITTLE FALLS FIBRE CO.(1930)\nNo. 47\nArgued: December 4, 1929Decided: January 6, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 369, 370]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Nichols, Jr., and Robert E. Whalen, both of Albany, N. Y., and Clifford B. Longley and Wallace R. Middleton, both of Detroit, Mich., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 369, 372]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas O'Connor, George E. O'Connor, and Gerald W. O'Connor, all of Waterford, N. Y., for respondents.\n\n\n[280 U.S. 369, 374]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here on writ of certiorari to review a determination of the Court of Appeals of New York (249 N. Y. 495, 164 N. E. 558), upon which a judgment was entered in the state Supreme Court, awarding damages and an injunction restraining petitioner from maintaining flashboards on the crest of the 'Federal Dam,' constructed in the Hudson River near Troy, N. Y., under acts of Congress. Act of June 25, 1910, c. 382, 36 Stat. 630; Act March 4, 1913, c. 144, 37 Stat. 801,\n Respondents, it is stipulated, are riparian owners on the Mohawk river, above its confluence with the Hudson, where at a point about three miles above the federal dam they own a dam and water power which they maintain for the development of power for use in their factories on adjacent land. The petitioner, a private business corporation, has procured from the Federal Power Commission a license for a hydroelectric power project, purporting to be granted under the Federal Water Power Act of June 10, 1920, 41 Stat. 1063 (U. S. Code, title 16, c. 12 (16 USCA  792-823)). The license granted permission to use surplus water from the federal dam for the development of power at a plant to be constructed and maintained by petitioner for that purpose, on government land. As the license also per- \n\n[280 U.S. 369, 375]\n\u00a0\n mits, but does not require, petitioner has placed flashboards on the crest of the dam which, under normal conditions, raise the level of the water in the pool above the dam approximately two feet. Electric power developed by the project is used in the business of an affiliated private manufacturing corporation. The maintenance of the water at the new level has resulted in materially raising the water at the tailraces of respondents' power plants, with a corresponding reduction of the head of water and of the power developed at their dam.\n As the court below held, the acts complained of constitute, under local law, an actionable wrong, entitling respondents to an injunction and to damages. Hammond v. Fuller, 1 Paige (N. Y.) 197; Brown v. Bowen, 30 N. Y. 519, 86 Am. Dec. 406; Hall v. Augsbury, 46 N. Y. 622, 625, 626; Rothery v. New York Rubber Co., 24 Hun, 172, affirmed 90 N. Y. 30; American Woolen Co. v. State, 195 App. Div. 698, 705, 187 N. Y. S. 341. To avoid this liability petitioner relies on the federal right or immunity specially set up by its answer, that the Hudson and Mohawk are navigable rivers; that all of the acts complained of were done under the license and authority of the Federal Power Commission and under regulations of the Secretary of War, authorized by the Water Power Act; that the license and the acts of petitioner authorized by it were found by the Commission to be desirable and justified in the public interest for the purpose of improving and developing the Hudson river for the benefit of interstate commerce, and that the petitioner, acting under the license, is an agency of the federal government, in the exercise of its power to regulate commerce and navigation.\n It is contended that the navigable capacity of the Hudson and the Mohawk is subject to the regulation and control of Congress, under clause 3 of section 8, art. 1, of the Constitution, Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1; Gilman v. Philadelphia, 3 Wall. 713, 724; United States v. Chandler \n\n[280 U.S. 369, 376]\n\u00a0\n Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53, 63\n, 33 S. Ct. 667; New Jersey v. Sargent, \n269 \nU.S. 328, 337\n, 46 S. Ct. 122, which may constitutionally be delegated to the Power Commission, cf. Wisconsin v. Illinois, \n278 \nU.S. 367, 415\n, 49 S. Ct. 163; that even if the finding of the Commission that the licensed project is in aid of commerce and navigation is not conclusive, as petitioner asserts it is, and even though some of the power developed by petitioner is used for private purposes, the raising of the level of the water by the use of flashboards is shown by the evidence to be beneficial to navigation, and it was therefore within the competency of the Commission to determine whether the project should be authorized. It appears that the petitioner is required by the license and its acceptance of it to supply from the licensed project power in specified amounts for the lighting and operation of the existing government lock and a second projected lock at the federal dam, which are instrumentalities of navigation.\n It is argued that Congress, by the Federal Water Power Act, has authorized the Commission to develop navigation and for that purpose to establish obstructions in navigable waters, and, subject only to the constitutional requirement of compensation for property taken, its power when so exercised is supreme; that the present exercise of that power does not amount to a taking of the respondents' property, for the reason that it does not appear that the obstruction has so raised the water as to flood the respondents' land, and any right of theirs recognized by the state and asserted here, to have the river flow in its natural manner without obstruction, is subordinate to the power of the national government exerted by the Commission through its licensee, whose action, so far as it affects respondents' water power, is damnum absque injuria.

Ct. 48; Lewis Blue Point Oyster Co. v. Briggs, \n229 \nU.S. 82\n, 33 S. Ct. 679; see Fox River \n\n[280 U.S. 369, 377]\n\u00a0\n Paper Co. v. Railway Commission of Wisconsin, \n274 \nU.S. 651\n, 47 S. Ct. 669; Chase-Hibbard Co. v. City of Elmira, 207 N. Y. 460, 101 N. E. 158, 47 L. R. A. (N. S.) 470; compare United States v. Cress, \n243 \nU.S. 316\n, 37 S. Ct. 380.\n The respondents insist, as the court below found, that the federal dam was designed to be sufficient for purposes of navigation without the flashboards and it was unnecessary to use them for purposes of navigation; that the petitioner had installed them for the development of power for its own private use; that the effect upon navigation of the power plant and flashboards is negligible, hence the licensed project was not one authorized under the Federal Water Power Act. In any case, it is urged that the injury and damage complained of amount to a taking of respondents' property without compensation, and, further, that the Federal Water Power Act, by its terms, does not authorize the granting of licenses which would enable the licensee to destroy or affect the rights of riparian owners.\n But, in the view we take of the application of the Federal Water Power Act to the present case, it is unnecessary to decide all the issues thus sharply raised. Whether the Commission acted within or without its jurisdiction in granting the license, and even though the rights which the respondents here assert be deemed subordinate to the power of the national government to control navigation, the present legislation does not purport to authorize a licensee of the Commission to impair such rights recognized by state law without compensation. Even though not immune from such destruction, they are, nevertheless, an appropriate subject for legislative protection. See United States v. Realty Company, \n163 \nU.S. 427\n, 16 S. Ct. 1120; Guthrie National Bank v. Guthrie, \n173 \nU.S. 528, 535\n, 19 S. Ct. 513; Joslin Co. v. Providence, \n262 \nU.S. 668, 675\n, 676 S., 43 S. Ct. 684; Otis Co. v.

Especially is there reason for such protection where, as here, their sacrifice may be involved \n\n[280 U.S. 369, 378]\n\u00a0\n in the grant of a valuable privilege to a licensee. We think that the provisions of the act are quite sufficient in themselves to save respondents from any such appropriation of their water power.\n Section 10(c), Federal Water Power Act (title 16, U. S. Code,  803(c ), 16 USCA  803(c), provides that licensees 'shall be liable for all damages occasioned to the property of others by the construction, maintenance, or operation' of the licensed project, and by section 27 of the act (title 16, U. S. Code,  821 (16 USCA  821)) it is provided: 'Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as affecting or intending to affect or in any way to interfere with the laws of the respective States relating to the control, appropriation, ... or distribution of water used in irrigation or for municipal or other uses, or any vested right acquired therein.' By section 21 of the act (title 16, U. S. Code,  814 (16 USCA  814)), licensees are given the power of eminent domain and authorized to conduct condemnation proceedings in district or state courts for the acquisition 'or the right to use or damage the lands or property of others necessary to the construction, maintenance, or operation of any dam ... (or) ... diversion structure ...' in connection with an authorized project which they are unable to acquire by contract. By section 6 of act (title 16, U. S. Code,  799 (16 USCA  799)), all licenses are required to be 'conditioned upon acceptance by the licensee of all the terms and conditions of this Act.'\n While these sections are consistent with the recognition that state laws affecting the distribution or use of water in navigable waters and the rights derived from those laws may be subordinate to the power of the national government to regulate commerce upon them, they nevertheless so restrict the operation of the entire act that the powers conferred by it on the Commission do not extend to the impairment of the operation of those laws or to the extinguishment of rights acquired under them without remuneration. We think the interest here asserted by \n\n[280 U.S. 369, 379]\n\u00a0\n the respondents, so far as the laws of the state are concerned, is a vested right acquired under those laws, and so is one expressly saved by section 27 from destruction or appropriation by licensees without compensation, and that it is one which petitioner, by acceptance of the license under the provisions of section 6, must be deemed to have agreed to recognize and protect. Whether section 21, giving to licensees the power of eminent domain, confers on them power to condemn rights such as those of respondents, and whether it might have been invoked by the petitioner in the present situation, are questions not before us.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOME INS. CO. v. DICK(1930)\nNo. 232\nArgued: February 27, 1930Decided: May 5, 1930\n\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 397, 399]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. David Rumsey and Mark W. Maclay, both of New York City, for appellants. \n\n[281 U.S. 397, 400]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John Neethe and H. C. Hughes, both of Galveston, Tex., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 397, 402]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Dick, a citizen of Texas, brought this action in a court of that state against Compania General Anglo-Mexicana de Seguros S. A., a Mexican corporation, to recover on a policy of fire insurance for the total loss of a tug. Jurisdiction was asserted in rem through garnishment, by ancillary writs issued against the Home Insurance Company and Franklin Fire Insurance Company, which reinsured, by contracts with the Mexican corporation, parts of the risk which it had assumed. The garnishees are New York corporations. Upon them, service was effected by serving their local agents in Texas appointed pursuant to Texas statutes, which require the appointment of local agents by foreign corporations seeking permits to do business within the state.\n The controversy here is wholly between Dick and the garnishees. The defendant has never been admitted to do business in Texas; has not done any business there; and has not authorized any one to receive service of process or enter an appearance for it in this cause. It was cited by publication, in accordance with a Texas statute; attorneys were appointed for it by the trial court; and they filed on its behalf an answer which denied liability. But there is no contention that thereby jurisdiction in personam over it was acquired. Dick's claim is that, since the obligation of a reinsurer to pay the original insurer arises upon the happening of the loss, and is not conditional upon prior payment of the loss by the insurer, Allemannia Fire Insurance Co. v. Firemen's Insurance Co., \n209 \nU.S. 326\n, 28 S. Ct. 544, 14 Ann. Cas. 948; Hicks v. Poe, \n269 \nU.S. 118\n, 46 S. Ct. 29, the New York companies are indebted to the Mexican company, and these debts are subject to garnishment in a proceeding against the latter quasi in rem, even though it is not suable in personam. The garnishees concede that inability to sue the \n\n[281 U.S. 397, 403]\n\u00a0\n Mexican corporation in Texas, in personam, is not material, if a cause of action against it existed at the time of garnishment and there was within the state a res belonging to it. But they deny the existence of the cause of action or of the res.\n Their defense rests upon the following facts: This suit was not commenced till more than one year after the date of the loss. The policy provided: 'It is understood and agreed that no judicial suit or demand shall be entered before any tribunal for the collection of any claim under this policy, unless such suits or demands are filed within one year counted as from the date on which such damage occurs.' This provision was in accord with the Mexican law to which the policy was expressly made subject. \n1\n It was issued by the Mexican company in Mexico to one Bonner, of Tampico, Mexico, and was there duly assigned to Dick prior to the loss. It covered the vessel only in certain Mexican waters. The premium was paid in Mexico; and the loss was 'payable in the City of Mexico in current funds of the United States of Mexico, or their equivalent elsewhere.' \n2\n At the time the policy was is- \n\n[281 U.S. 397, 404]\n\u00a0\n sued, when it was assigned to him, and until after the loss, Dick actually resided in Mexico, although his permanent residence was in Texas. The contracts of reinsurance were effected by correspondence between the Mexican company in Mexico and the New York companies in New York. Nothing thereunder was to be done, or was in fact done, in Texas.\n In the trial court, the garnishees contended that, since the insurance contract was made and was to be performed in Mexico, and the one- year provision was valid by its laws, Dick's failure to sue within one year after accrual of the alleged cause of action was a complete defense to the suit on the policy; that this failure also relieved the garnishees of any obligation as reinsurers, the same defense being open to them, New York State Marine Ins. Co. v. Protection Ins. Co., 1 Story, 458, 460, Fed. Cas. No. 10,216; and that they, consequently, owed no debt to the Mexican company subject to garnishment. \n3\n To this defense Dick demurred, on the ground that article 5545 of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes (1925) provides: 'No person, firm, corporation, association or combination of whatsoever kind shall enter into any stipulation, contract, or agree- \n\n[281 U.S. 397, 405]\n\u00a0\n ment, by reason whereof the time in which to sue thereon is limited to a shorter period than two years. And no stipulation, contract, or agreement for any such shorter limitation in which to sue shall ever be valid in this State.'\n The trial court sustained Dick's contention and entered judgment against the garnishees. On appeal, both in the Court of Civil Appeals (8 S. W.(2d) 354) and in the Supreme Court of the state (15 S.W.(2d) 1028), the garnishees asserted that, as construed and applied, the Texas statute violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the contract clause. Both courts treated the policy provision as equivalent to a foreign statute of limitation; held that article 5545 related to the remedy available in Texas courts; concluded that it was validly applicable to the case at bar; and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The garnishees appealed to this Court on the ground that the statute, as construed and applied, violated their rights under the Federal Constitution. Dick moved to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction. Then the garnishees filed, also, a petition for a writ of certiorari. Consideration of the jurisdiction of this Court on the appeal, and of the petition for certiorari, was postponed to the hearing of the case on the merits.\n First. Dick contends that this Court lacks jurisdiction of the action, because the errors assigned involve only questions of local law and of conflict of laws. The argument is that, while a provision requiring notice of loss within a fixed period is substantive because it is a condition precedent to the existence of the cause of action, the provision for liability only in case suit is brought within the year is not substantive because it relates only to the remedy after accrual of the cause of action; that, while the validity, interpretation, and performance of the substantive provisions of a contract are determined by \n\n[281 U.S. 397, 406]\n\u00a0\n the law of the place where it is made and is to be performed, matters which relate only to the remedy are unquestionably governed by the lex fori; and that, even if the Texas court erred in holding the statute applicable to this contract, the error is one of state law or of the interpretation of the contract, and is not reviewable here.\n The contention is unsound. There is no dispute as to the meaning of the provision in the policy. It is that the insurer shall not be liable unless suit is brought within one year of the loss. Whether the provision be interpreted as making the commencement of a suit within the year a condition precedent to the existence of a cause of action, or as making failure to sue within the year a breach of a condition subsequent which extinguishes the cause of action, is not of legal significance here. \n4\n Nor are we concerned with the question whether the provision is properly described as relating to remedy or to substance. However characterized, it is an express term in the contract of the parties by which the right of the insurer and the correlative obligation of the insurer are defined. If effect is given to the clause, Dick cannot recover from the Mexican corporation, and the garnishees cannot be compelled to pay. If, on the other hand, the statute is applied to the contract, it admittedly abrogates a contractual right \n\n[281 U.S. 397, 407]\n\u00a0\n and imposes liability, although the parties have agreed that there should be none.\n The statute is not simply one of limitation. It does not merely fix the time in which the aid of the Texas courts may be invoked. Nor does it govern only the remedies available in the Texas courts. It deals with the powers and capacities of persons and corporations. It expressly prohibits the making of certain contracts. As construed, it also directs the disregard in Texas of contractual rights and obligations wherever created and assumed; and it commands the enforcement of obligations in excess of those contracted for. Therefore, the objection that, as applied to contracts made and to be performed outside of Texas, the statute violates the Federal Constitution, raises federal questions of substance; and the existence of the federal claim is not disproved by saying that the statute, or the one-year provision in the policy, relates to the remedy and not to the substance.\n That the federal questions were not raised in the trial court is immaterial. For the Court of Civil Appeals and the Supreme Court of the State considered the questions as properly raised in the appellate proceedings, and passed on them adversely to the federal claim. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Perry, \n259 \nU.S. 548, 551\n, 42 S. Ct. 524; Sully v. American National Bank, \n178 \nU.S. 289, 298\n, 20 S. Ct. 935. The case is properly here on appeal. The motion to dismiss the appeal is overruled; and the petition for certiorari is therefore denied.\n Second. The Texas statute as here construed and applied deprives the garnishees of property without due process of law. A state may, of course, prohibit and declare invalid the making of certain contracts within its borders. Ordinarily, it may prohibit performance within its borders, even of contracts validly made elsewhere, if they are required to be performed within the state and their performance would violate its laws. But, in the \n\n[281 U.S. 397, 408]\n\u00a0\n case at bar, nothing in any way relating to the policy sued on, or to the contracts of reinsurance, was ever done or required to be done in Texas. All acts relating to the making of the policy were done in Mexico. All in relation to the making of the contracts of reinsurance were done there or in New York. And, likewise, all things in regard to performance were to be done outside of Texas. Neither the Texas laws nor the Texas courts were invoked for any purpose, except by Dick in the bringing of this suit. The fact that Dick's permanent residence was in Texas is without significance. At all times here material he was physically present and acting in Mexico. Texas was therefore without power to affect the terms of contracts so made. Its attempt to impose a greater obligation than that agreed upon and to seize property in payment of the imposed obligation violates the guaranty against deprivation of property without due process of law.

Dodge, \n246 \nU.S. 357\n, 38 S. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 593. Compare Modern Woodmen of America v. Mixer, \n267 \nU.S. 544, 551\n, 45 S. Ct. 389, 41 A. L. R. 1384.5\n The cases relied upon, in which it was held that a state may lengthen its statute of limitations, are not in point. \n\n[281 U.S. 397, 409]\n\u00a0\n See Atchafalaya Land Co. v. Williams Cypress Co., \n258 \nU.S. 190\n, 42 S. Ct. 284; National Surety Co. v. Architectural Decorating Co., \n226 \nU.S. 276\n, 33 S. Ct. 17; Vance v. Vance, \n108 \nU.S. 514\n, 2 S. Ct. 854. In those cases, the parties had not stipulated a time limit for the enforcement of their obligations. It is true that a state may extend the time within which suit may be brought in its own courts, if, in doing so, it violates no agreement of the parties. \n6\n And, in the absence of a contractual provision, the local statute of limitation may be applied to a right created in another jurisdiction even where the remedy in the latter is barred. \n7\n In such cases, the rights and obligations of the parties are not varied. When, however, the parties have expressly agreed upon a time limit on their obligation, a statute which invalidates the agreement and directs enforcement of the contract after the time has expired increases their obligation and imposes a burden not contracted for.\n It is true also that a state is not bound to provide remedies and procedure to suit the wishes of individual litigants. It may prescribe the kind of remedies to be available in its courts and dictate the practice and procedure to be followed in pursuing those remedies. Con- \n\n[281 U.S. 397, 410]\n\u00a0\n tractual provisions relating to these matters, even if valid where made, are often disregarded by the court of the forum, pursuant to statute or otherwise. But the Texas statute deals neither with the kind of remedy available nor with the mode in which it is to be pursued. It purports to create rights and obligations. It may not validly affect contracts which are neither made nor are to be performed in Texas.\n Third. Dick urges that article 5545 of the Texas law is a declaration of its public policy; and that a state may properly refuse to recognize foreign rights which violate its declared policy. Doubtless, a state may prohibit the enjoyment by persons within its borders of rights acquired elsewhere which violate its laws or public policy; and, under some circumstances, it may refuse to aid in the enforcement of such rights. Bothwell v. Buckbee, Mears Co., \n275 \nU.S. 274, 277\n, 279 S., 48 S. Ct. 124; Union Trust Co. v. Grosman, \n245 \nU.S. 412\n, 38 S. Ct. 147; compare Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230\n, 28 S. Ct. 641. But the Mexican corporation never was in Texas; and neither it nor the garnishees invoked the aid of the Texas courts or the Texas laws. The Mexican corporation was not before the court. The garnishees were brought in by compulsory process. Neither has asked favors. They ask only to be let alone. We need not consider how far the state may go in imposing restrictions on the conduct of its own residents, and of foreign corporations which have received permission to do business within its borders; or how far it may go in refusing to lend the aid of its courts to the enforcement of rights acquired outside its borders. It may not abrogate the rights of parties beyond its borders having no relation to anything done or to be done within them.\n Fourth. Finally, it is urged that the Federal Constitution does not require the states to recognize and protect rights derived from the laws of foreign countries-that as to them the full faith and credit clause has no applica- \n\n[281 U.S. 397, 411]\n\u00a0\n tion. See AEtna Life Ins. Co. v. Tremblay, \n223 \nU.S. 185\n, 32 S. Ct. 309. The claims here asserted are not based upon the full faith and credit clause. Compare Royal Arcanum v. Green, \n237 \nU.S. 531\n, 35 S. Ct. 724, L. R. A. 1916A, 771. Modern Woodmen of America v. Mixer, \n267 \nU.S. 544\n, 45 S. Ct. 389, 41 A. L. R. 1384. They rest upon the Fourteenth Amemdment. Its protection extends to aliens. Moreover, the parties in interest here are American companies. The defense asserted is based on the provision of the policy and on their contracts of reinsurance. The courts of the state confused this defense with that based on the Mexican Code. They held that, even if the effect of the foreign statute was to extinguish the right, Dick's removal to Texas prior to the bar of the foreign statute removed the cause of action from Mexico, and subjected it to the Texas statute of limitation. And they applied the same rule to the provision in the policy. Whether or not that is a sufficient answer to the defense based on the foreign law we may not consider; for no issue under the full faith and credit clause was raised. But in Texas, as elsewhere, the contract was subject to its own limitations.\n Fifth. The garnishees contend that the guaranty of the contract clause relates, not to the date of enactment of a statute, but to the date of its effect on contracts; that, when issued, the policy of the Mexican corporation was concededly not subject to Texas law; that, although the statute relied upon by Dick was passed prior to the making of the contract, it did not operate upon the contract until this suit was brought in the Texas court; and that, hence, the statute violates the contract clause. Since we hold that the Texas statute, as construed and applied, violates the due process clause, we have no occasion to consider this contention. Nor have we considered their further contention, in reliance upon Morris & Co. v. Skandinavia Ins. Co., \n279 \nU.S. 405\n, 49 S. Ct. 360, that there was lack of jurisdiction over them for purposes of garnishment, because the authorization of service upon their local agents is lim- \n\n[281 U.S. 397, 412]\n\u00a0\n ited to suits brought against them as defendants. For this objection was not made or considered below on constitutional grounds.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The policy contained also the provision: 'The present policy is subjected to the disposition of the Commercial Code, in that it does not alter or modify the stipulations which that same contains.' The dispositions of the Commercial Code thus incorporated are: 'Article 1038. The rights of action derived from commercial acts shall be subject to prescription in accordance with the provisions of this Code. Article 1039. The periods fixed for the enforcement of rights of action arising out of commercial acts shall be fatal except restitution against same is given. Article 1043. One year shall prescribe actions derived from contracts of life insurance, sea and land.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The loss was made payable to Dick and the Texas & Gulf Steamship Company as their interests might appear. The steamship company and Suderman & Young, Inc., assignee of part of the cause of action, intervened as plaintiffs, and are joined with Dick as appellees. As there are no rights peculiar to them, they need not be further referred to. Dick contends that, since the policy was payable to the Texas & Gulf Steamship Company, the contract was performable in Texas. The contention is in conflict with the quoted language of the policy, and there is no provision otherwise lending support to the argument. Texas is nowhere mentioned in the policy. Moreover, there is nothing in the record to show that the steamship company's sole place of business was in Texas. The state courts made no findings on this claim. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Besides the defense here discussed the answers both of the Mexican corporation and of the garnishees alleged: (2) That the suit was not brought within the period provided by the Commercial Code of Mexico, and that thereby the right of action was completely barred upon the expiration of one year; (3) that the policy was void because of plaintiff's misrepresentations as to the value of the vessel; (4) that the vessel was not a total loss, and was abandoned, in violation of the terms of the policy. None of these defense needs to be considered. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] That a provision requiring notice of loss within a fixed period and one requiring the bringing of suit stand upon the same footing was held in Riddlesbarger v. Hartford Insurance Co., 7 Wall. 386, 390. Compare Semmes v. Hartford Insurance Co., 13 Wall. 158, 161. The validity and effectiveness of a clause limiting the time for suit, in the absence of a controlling statute, was recognized also in Texas, Suggs v. Travelers' Insurance Co., 71 Tex. 579, 9 S. W. 676, 1 L. R. A. 847. In that case, decided before the enactment of article 5545, the Texas court upheld a similar provision in an insurance policy against the claim of an infant without capacity to sue. The court described the nature of the provision thus at page 581 of 71 Tex., 9 S. W. 676, 677: 'It is said to differ from the statutory limitation in this: that it does not merely deny the remedy, but forfeits the liability, when the suit is not brought within the stipulated time.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The division of this court in the Tabacos and Dodge Cases was not on the principle here stated, but on the question of fact whether there were in those cases things done within the state of which the state could property lay hold as the basis of the regulations there imposed. Compare Bothwell v. Buckabee, Mears Co., \n275 \nU.S. 274\n, 48 S. Ct. 124; Palmetto Fire Ins. Co. v. Conn, \n272 \nU.S. 295\n, 47 S. Ct. 88. In the absence of any such things, as in this case, the Court was agreed that a state is without power to impose either public or private obligations on contracts made outside of the state and not to be performed there. Compare Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Liebing, \n259 \nU.S. 209\n, 42 S. Ct. 407; E. Merick Dodd, Jr., 'The Power of the Supreme Court to Review State Decisions in the Field of Conflict of Laws,' 39 Harv. L. Rev. (1926) 533, 548. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The state courts placed some reliance on Campbell v. Holt, \n115 \nU.S. 620\n, 6 S. Ct. 209. Whether, as there held, a statute of limitations may also be lengthened so as to affect liabilities already barred is not here pertinent. There is a clear difference between the revival of a liability which is unenforceable only because a statute has barred the remedy regardless of the will of the parties, and the extension of a liability beyond the limit expressly agreed upon by the parties. Compare National Surety Co. v. Architectural Decorating Co., \n226 \nU.S. 276, 282\n, 33 S. Ct. 17; William Danzer & Co. v. Gulf Island R. R. Co., \n268 \nU.S. 633, 636\n, 45 S. Ct. 612. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Whether a distinction is to be drawn between statutes of limitation which extinguish or limit the right and those which merely bar the remedy, we need not now determine.

Baker, of Dallas, Tex., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 122, 125]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fifth Cicui t. \n281 \nU.S. 715\n, 50 S. Ct. 460. It involves the same questions with respect to community income under Texas law as are involved in Nos. 15 (Poe v. Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101\n, 51 S. Ct. 58) and 106 (Goodell v. Koch, \n282 \nU.S. 118\n, 51 S. Ct. 62) under the law of Arizona and Washington.\n Respondent was assessed additional income tax for 1927, because he and his wife had made separate returns and had each returned one-half of the community income, whereas the Commissioner of Internal Revenue asserted that the respondent must return the whole thereof. Respondent paid under protest, brought suit in the District Court (27 F.(2d) 140), and recovered judgment. The collector appealed and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment (38 F.(2d) 651).\n In view of our decision in No. 15, the only matter to be examined here is whether under the community property system of Texas the wife has a mere expectancy, as she would under the law of California (cf. United States v. Robbins, \n269 \nU.S. 315\n, 46 S. Ct. 148), or on the contrary has a proprietary vested interest in the community \n\n[282 U.S. 122, 126]\n\u00a0\n property such as makes her an owner of one-half of the community income.\n The statutes contain sweeping provisions as to what shall be included in community property. They provide that each spouse shall have testamentary power over his or her respective interest in the community property. In the event of failure to exercise such testamentary power they provide that the property shall go in the first instance to the descendants of the deceased spouse. They provide, as is usual in States having the community system, that the husband shall have power of management and control such that he may deal with community property very much as if it were his own. In spite of this, however, it is settled that in Texas the wife has a present vested interest in such property. Arnold v. Leonard, 114 Tex. 535, 273 S. W. 799. Her interest is said to be equal to the husband's. Wright v. Hays, 10 Tex. 130, 60 Am. Dec. 200. It is held that the spouses' rights of property in the effects of the community are perfectly equivalent to each other. Arnold v. Leonard, supra. These expressions as to the wife's interest are confirmed by the authorities holding that if the husband, as agent of the community, acts in fraud of the wife's rights, she is not without remedy in the courts. Stramler v. Coe, 15 Tex. 211; Martin v. Moran, 11 Tex. Civ. App. 509, 32 S. W. 904; Watson v. Harris, 61 Tex. Civ. App. 263, 130 S. W. 237; Davis v. Davis ( Tex. Civ. App.) 186 S. W. 775.\n The applicable statutory provisions are noted in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In view of what has been said in No. 15, it remains only to say that the interest of a wife in community property in Texas is properly characterized as a \n\n[282 U.S. 122, 127]\n\u00a0\n present vested interest, equal and equivalent to that of her husband, and that one-half of the community income is therefore income of the wife. She and her husband are entitled to make separate returns, each of one-half of such income. The Judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revised Civil Statutes, Texas, 1925, Vols.

Brown, of Minneapolis, Minn., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 57, 59]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Stanley B. Houck, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 57, 62]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case certiorari was granted May 27, 1929 (\n279 \nU.S. 833\n, 49 S. Ct. 483), to review a ruling of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upon the measure of damages recoverable in a suit brought under the Cummins Amendment of March 4, 1915, 38 Stat. 1197, as amended 41 Stat. 494, 49 U. S. C.  20(11), (49 USCA 20(11) against a rail carrier for failure to deliver a part of an interstate shipment of coal.\n Respondent, plaintiff below, a coal dealer in Minneapolis, purchased, while in transit, a carload of coal weighing at shipment 88,700 pounds. On delivery at destination, the respondent's industrial siding, there was a shortage of 5,500 pounds. At the time of arrival, respondent had not resold any of the coal. It was intended to be, and was, added to his stock of coal for resale, but the shortage did not interfere with the maintenance of his usual stock. He lost no sales by reason of it, and purchased no coal to replace the shortage, except in carload lots. In the course of his business, respondent could not did, both before and after the present shipment, purchase coal of like quality in carload lots of 60, 000 pounds or more, delivered at his siding, at $5.50 per ton, plus freight. The market price in Minneapolis for like coal sold at retail in less than carload lots was $13 per ton including $3.30 freight.\n The case was twice tried. On the first trial, the District Court gave judgment for the wholesale value of the coal not delivered. 2 F.(2d) 287. The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment, holding that it should have been for the retail value of the coal. 13 F.(2d) 459. Upon \n\n[281 U.S. 57, 63]\n\u00a0\n retrial, the District Court gave judgment accordingly, 21 F.(2d) 831, which was affirmed below, 31 F.(2d) 111.\n By the Cummins Amendment the holder of a bill of lading issued for an interstate rail shipment is entitled to recover for failure to make delivery of any part of the shipment without legal excuse, 'the full actual loss, damage, or injury to such property' at point of destination. Chicago, etc., Ry. Co. v. McCaull-Dinsmore Co., \n253 \nU.S. 97\n, 40 S. Ct. 504.\n It is not denied that a recovery measured by the wholesale market price of the coal would fully compensate the respondent, or that the retail price, taken as the measure of the recovery allowed below, includes costs of delivery to retail consumers which respondent did not incur, and a retail profit which he had not earned by any contract of resale. But respondent contends, as was held below, that the established measure of damage for nondelivery of a shipment of merchandise is the sum required to replace the exact amount of the shortage at the stipulated time and place of delivery, which, in this case, would be its retail value, and that convenience and the necessity for a uniform rule require its application here.\n This contention ignores the basic principle underlying common-law remedies that they shall afford only compensation for the injury suffered, Milwaukee, etc., R. R. Co. v. Arms et al., \n91 U.S. 489\n; Chicago, etc., Ry. Co. v. McCaull-Dinsmore Co., supra, 100 of 253 U. S., 40 S. Ct. 504; Robinson v. Harman, 1 Exch. 850, 855; Sedgwick, Damages (9th Ed.) 25; Sutherland, Damages (4th Ed.)  12; Williston on Contracts,  1338, and leaves out of account the language of the amendment, which likewise gives only a right of recovery for 'actual loss.' The rule urged by respondents was applied below in literal accordance with its conventional statement. As so stated, when applied to cases as they usually arise, it is a convenient and accurate method of arriving at an amount of recovery which is \n\n[281 U.S. 57, 64]\n\u00a0\n compensatory. As so stated, it would have been applicable here if there had been a failure to deliver the entire carload of coal, since the wholesale price, at which a full carload could have been procured at point of destination, would have afforded full compensation, Chicago, Milwaukee, etc., Ry. Co. v. McCaull-Dinsmore Co., supra; Central of Georgia Ry. Co. v. American Coal Co., 28 Ga. App. 95, 110 S. E. 320; Wendnagel v. Houston, 155 Ill. App. 664; Lake Erie, etc., R. R. Co. v.

W. 496, or, in some circumstances, if respondent had been under any constraint to purchase less than a carload lot to repair his loss or carry on his business, for in that event the measure of his loss would have been the retail market cost of the necessary replacement, Haskell v. Hunter, 23 Mich. 305, 309. But in the actual circumstances the cost of replacing the exact shortage at retail price was not the measure of the loss, since it was capable of replacement, and was, in fact, replaced in the course of respondent's business from purchases made in carload lots at wholesale market price without added expense.\n There is no greater inconvenience in the application of the one standard of value than the other, and we perceive no advantage to be gained from an adherence to a rigid uniformity, which would justify sacrificing the reason of the rule, to its letter. The test of market value is at best but a convenient means of getting at the loss suffered. It may be discarded and other more accurate means resorted to, if, for special reasons, it is not exact or otherwise \n\n[281 U.S. 57, 65]\n\u00a0\n not applicable. See Wilmoth v. Hamilton (C. C. A.) 127 F. 48, 51; Theiss v. Weiss, 166 Pa. 9, 19, 31 A. 63, 45 Am. St. Rep. 638; Pittsburg Sheet Mfg., Co. v. West Penn Sheet Steel Co., 201 Pa. 150, 50 A. 935; Williston on Contracts,  1384, 1385. In the absence of special circumstances, the damage for shortage in delivery by the seller of fungible goods sold by quantity is measured by the bulk price rather than the price for smaller quantities, both at common law, see Morgan v. Gath, 3 Hurl. & C. 748; Avery v. Willson, 81 N. Y. 341, 37 Am. Rep. 503, and under section 44 of the Uniform Sales Act. Likewise, we think that the wholesale market price is to be preferred as a test over the retail when, in circumstances like the present, it is clearly the more accurate measure. Brown Coal Co. v. Illinois Central R. R. Co., 196 Iowa, 562, 192 N. W. 920. See State v. Smith, 31 Mo. 566; Wendnagel v. Houston, supra, 666, 667 of 155 Ill. App.; Wood & Co. v. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry.

Co., 258 Mass. 149, 154 N. E. 831, 50 A. L. R. 1464, cited as supporting the conclusion of the court below. In these cases it does not clearly appear whether the consignee suffered special damage by reason of the shortage, measured by the retail price, or whether he did or could replace it at the wholesale price in the ordinary course of business.\n The court below thought that the fact that the award to respondent of the expense and profit, included in the retail price to consumers, did not militate against the rule it applied for the reason that the wholesale price, as is often the case where market price is the measure of loss, likewise included a profit over mine cost plus freight. But respondent had done every act and incurred every expense prerequisite to procuring delivery at destination. Any profit included in its market value at the stipulated time and place of arrival was, therefore, appropriately included in the measure of his loss. In this respect it is \n\n[281 U.S. 57, 66]\n\u00a0\n distinguishable from the expense and prospective profit not actually incurred or earned by respondent, represented by the retail price.

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION(1930)\nNo. 42\nArgued: Decided: January 6, 1930\n\n\n Commission \n280 U.S. 291\n (1930) ]\n\n\n[280 U.S. 291, 293]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles Nagel, J. D. Williamson, and Frank Y. Gladney, all of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. John Lord O'Brian, Asst. to Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a proceeding instituted by complaint of the Federal Trade Commission against petitioner charging a violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, 731, c. 323 (U. S. Code, title 15,  18 (15 USCA  18)), which provides:\n'No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce in any section or community, or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce. ...\n\n'This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about, or in attempting to bring about, the substantial lessening of competition.'\n\n The complaint charges that in May, 1921, while petitioner and the W. H. McElwain Company were engaged in commerce in competition with each other, petitioner acquired all, or substantially all, of the capital stock of the McElwain Company and still owns and controls the \n\n[280 U.S. 291, 294]\n\u00a0\n same; that the effect of such acquisition was to substantially lessen competition between the two companies; to restrain commerce in the shoe business in the localities where both were engaged in business in interstate commerce; and to tend to create a monopoly in interstate commerce in such business. The last-named charge has not been pressed and may be put aside. Upon a hearing before the Commission evidence was introduced from which the Commission found: (a) That the capital stock of the McElwain Company had been acquired by the petitioner at the time charged in the complaint; (b) that the two companies were at the time in substantial competition with one another; and (c) that the effect of the acquisition was to substantially lessen competition between them and to restrain commerce. Thereupon the Commission put down an order directing petitioner to divest itself of all capital stock of the McElwain Company then held or owned, directly or indirectly, by petitioner, and to cease and desist from the ownership, operation, management, and control of all assets acquired from the McElwain Company subsequent to the acquisition of the capital stock, etc., and to divest itself of all such assets, etc. Upon appeal by petitioner to the court below, the order of the Commission was affirmed. 29 F.(2d) 518.\n The principal grounds upon which the order here is assailed are: (1) That there never was substantial competition between the two corporations, and therefore no foundation for the charge of substantial lessening of competition; (2) that at the time of the acquisition the financial condition of the McElwain Company was such as to necessitate liquidation or sale, and therefore the prospect for future competition or restraint was entirely eliminated. Since, in our opinion, these grounds are determinative, we find it unnecessary to consider the challenge to the sufficiency of the complaint and other contentions.\n\n\n[280 U.S. 291, 295]\n\u00a0\n First. Prior to the acquisition of the capital stock in question, the International Shoe Company was engaged in manufacturing leather shoes of various kinds. It had a large number of tanneries and factories and sales houses located in several states. Its business was extensive, and its products were shipped and sold to purchasers practically throughout the United States. The McElwain Company, a Massachusetts corporation with its principal office in Boston, also manufactured shoes and sold and distributed them in several states of the Union. Principally, it made and sold dress shoes for men and boys. The International made and sold a line of men's dress shoes of various styles, which, although comparable in price, and to some degree in quality, with the men's dress shoes produced by the McElwain Company, differed from them in important particulars. Such competition as there was between the two companies related alone to men's dress shoes.\n The findings of the Commission that this competition between the two companies was substantial and, by the acquisition of the stock of the McElwain Company, had been substantially lessened, the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that they were fully supported by the evidence. Upon a careful review of the record we think the evidence requires a contrary conclusion.\n It is true that both companies were engaged in selling dress shoes to customers for resale within the limits of several of the same states; but the markets reached by the two companies within these states, with slight exceptions hereafter mentioned, were not the same. Certain substitutes for leather were used to some extent in the making of the McElwain dress shoes; and they were better finished, more attractive and modern in appearance, and appealed especially to city trade. The dress shoes of the International were made wholly of leather and were of a better wearing quality; but among the \n\n[280 U.S. 291, 296]\n\u00a0\n retailers who catered to city or fashionable wear, the McElwain shoes were preferred. The trade policies of the two companies so differed that the McElwain Company generally secured the trade of wholesalers and large retailers; while the International obtained the trade of dealers in the small communities. When requested, the McElwain Company stamped the name of the customer (that is the dealer) upon the shoes, which the International refused to do; and this operated to aid the former company to get, as generally it did get, the trade of the retailers in the larger cities. As an important result of the foregoing circumstances, witnesses estimated that about 95 per cent. of the McElwain sales were in towns and cities having a population of 10,000 or over; while about 95 per cent. of the sales of the International were in towns having a population of 6,000 or less. The bulk of the trade of each company was in different sections of the country, that of the McElwain Company being north of the Ohio river and east of the state of Illinois, while that of the International was in the south and west. An analysis of the sales of the International for the twelve months preceding the acquisition of the McElwain capital stock discloses that in 42 states no men's dress shoes were sold to customers of the McElwain Company; and that in the remaining six states during the same period a total of only 52 5\/12 dozen pairs of such shoes had been sold to sixteen retailers and three wholesalers who were also customers of the McElwain Company. This amounted to less than one-fourth of the production of dress shoes by the International for a single day, the daily production being about 250 dozen pairs.\n It is plain from the foregoing that the product of the two companies here in question, because of the difference in appearance and workmanship, appealed to the tastes of entirely different classes of consumers; that while a \n\n[280 U.S. 291, 297]\n\u00a0\n portion of the product of both companies went into the same states, in the main the product of each was in fact sold to a different class of dealers and found its way into distinctly separate markets. Thus it appears that in respect of 95 per cent. of the business there was no competition in fact and no contest, or observed tendency to contest, in the market for the same purchasers; and it is manifest that, when this is eliminated, what remains is of such slight consequence as to deprive the finding that there was substantial competition between the two corporations of any real support in the evidence. The rule to be followed is stated in Federal Trade Comm. v. Curtis Co., \n260 \nU.S. 568, 580\n, 43 S. Ct. 210, 213:\n'Manifestly, the court must inquire whether the commission's findings of fact are supported by evidence. If so supported, they are conclusive. But as the statute grants jurisdiction to make and enter, upon the pleadings, testimony and proceedings, a decree affirming, modifying or setting aside an order, the court must also have power to examine the whole record and ascertain for itself the issues presented and whether there are material facts not reported by the commission. If there be substantial evidence relating to such facts from which different conclusions reasonably may be drawn, the matter may be and ordinarily, we think, should be remanded to the commission- the primary fact-finding body-with direction to make additional findings, but if from all the circumstances it clearly appears, that in the interest of justice the controversy should be decided without further delay, the court has full power under the statute so to do. The language of the statute is broad and confers power of review not found in the Interstate Commerce Act. (49 USCA  1 et seq.)'\n\n Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as its terms and the nature of the remedy prescribed plainly suggest, was intended for the protection of the public against the evils \n\n[280 U.S. 291, 298]\n\u00a0\n which were supposed to flow from the undue lessening of competition. In Standard Oil Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 282 F. 81, 87, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit applied the test to the Clayton Act which had therefore been held applicable to the Sherman Act (15 USCA  1 et seq .), namely, that the standard of legality was the absence or presence of prejudice to the public interest by unduly restricting competition or unduly obstructing the due course of trade. In Federal Trade Comm. v. Sinclair Co., \n261 \nU.S. 463, 476\n, 43 S. Ct. 450, 454, referring to the Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 USCA  41-51), this court said:\n'The great purpose of both statutes was to advance the public interest by securing fair opportunity for the play of the contending forces ordinarily engendered by an honest desire for gain.'\n\n Mere acquisition by one corporation of the stock of a competitor, even though it result in some lessening of competition, is not forbidden; the act deals only with such acquisitions as probably will result in lessening competition to a substantial degree, Standard Fashion Co. v. Magrane-Houston Co., \n258 \nU.S. 346, 357\n, 42 S. Ct. 360; that is to say, to such a degree as will injuriously affect the public. Obviously such acquisition will not produce the forbidden result if there be no pre-existing substantial competition to be affected; for the public interest is not concerned in the lessening of competition, which, to begin with, is itself without real substance. To hold that the 95 per cent. of the McElwain product, sold in the large centers of population to meet a distinct demand for that particular product, was sold in competition with the 95 per cent. of the International product, sold in the rural sections and the small towns to meet a wholly different demand, is to apply the word 'competition' in a highly deceptive sense. And if it be conceded that the entire remaining 5 per cent. of each company's product (although clearly it was materially less than that) was sold \n\n[280 U.S. 291, 299]\n\u00a0\n in competitive markets, it is hard to see in this competition of such substance as to fall within the serious purposes of the Clayton Act. Compare Industrial Ass'n v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 64, 84\n, 45 S. Ct. 403.\n In addition to the circumstances already cited, the officers of the International testified categorically that there was in fact no substantial competition between the companies in respect of these shoes, but that at most competition was incidental and so imperceptible that it could not be located. The existence of competition is a fact disclosed by observation rather than by the processes of logic; and when these officers, skilled in the business which they have carried on, assert that there was no real competition in respect of the particular product, their testimony is to be weighed like that in respect of other matters of fact. And since there is no testimony to the contrary and no reason appears for doubting the accuracy of observation or credibility of the witnesses, their statements should be accepted.\n It follows that the conclusion of the commission and the court below to the effect that the acquisition of the capital stock in question would probably result in a substantial lessening of competition must fail for lack of a necessary basis upon which to rest.\n Second. Beginning in 1920 there was a marked falling off in prices and sales of shoes, as there was in other commodities; and, because of excessive commitments which the McElwain Company had made for the purchase of hides as well as the possession of large stocks of shoes and an inability to meet its indebtedness for large sums of borrowed money, the financial condition of the company became such that its officers, after long and careful consideration of the situation, concluded that the company was faced with financial ruin, and that the only alternatives presented were liquidation through a receiver or an outright sale. New orders were not coming in; losses \n\n[280 U.S. 291, 300]\n\u00a0\n during 1920 amounted to over $6,000,000; a surplus in May, 1920, of about $ 4,000,000 not only was exhausted, but within a year had been turned into a deficit of $4,382,136.70. In the spring of 1921 the company owed approximately $15,000,000 to some 60 or 70 banks and trust companies, and, in addition, nearly $2,000,000 on current account. Its factories, which had a capacity of 38,000 to 40,000 pairs of shoes per day, in 1921 were producing only 6,000 or 7,000 pairs. An examination of its balance sheets and statements, and the testimony of its officers and others conversant with the situation, clearly shows that the company had reached the point where it could no longer pay its debts as they became due. In the face of these adverse circumstances, it became necessary, under the laws of Massachusetts, to make up its annual financial statement, which, when filed, would disclose a condition of insolvency, as that term is defined by the statute and decisions of the state, General Laws 1921, c. 106,  65( 3); Holbrook v. International Trust Co., 220 Mass. 150, 155, 107 N. E. 665; Steele v. Commissioner of Banks, 240 Mass. 394, 397, 134 N. E. 401, 20 A. L. R. 1203, and thus bring the company to the point of involuntary liquidation. In this situation, dividends on second preferred and common stock were discontinued, and the first preferred stockholders were notified that the company was confronted with the necessity of discontinuing dividends on that class of stock as well.\n The condition of the International Company, on the contrary, notwithstanding these adverse conditions in the shoe trade generally, was excellent. That company had so conducted its affairs that its surplus stock was not excessive, and it was able to reduce prices. Instead of a decrease, it had an increase of business of about 25 per cent. in the number of shoes made and sold. During the early months of 1921, orders exceeded the ability of the company to produce, so that approximately one- third of \n\n[280 U.S. 291, 301]\n\u00a0\n them were necessarily canceled. In this situation, with demands for its products so much in excess of its ability to fill them, the International was approached by officers of the McElwain Company with a view to a sale of its property. After some negotiation, the purchase was agreed upon. The transaction took the form of a sale of the stock instead of the assets, not, as the evidence clearly establishes, because of any desire or intention to thereby affect competition, but because by that means the personnel and organization of the McElwain factories could be retained, which, for reasons that seem satisfactory, was regarded as vitally important. It is perfectly plain from all the evidence that the controlling purpose of the International in making the purchase in question was to secure additional factories, which it could not itself build with sufficient speed to meet the pressing requirements of its business.\n Shortly stated, the evidence establishes the case of a corporation in failing circumstances, the recovery of which to a normal condition was, to say the least, in gravest doubt, selling its capital to the only available purchaser in order to avoid what its officers fairly concluded was a more disastrous fate. It was suggested by the court below, and also here in argument, that instead of an outright sale, any one of several alternatives might have been adopted which would have saved the property and preserved competition; but, as it seems to us, all of these may be dismissed as lying wholly within the realm of speculation. The company might, as suggested, have obtained further financial help from the banks, with a resulting increased load of indebtedness which the company might have carried and finally paid, or, on the other hand, by the addition of which, it might more certainly have been crushed. As to that, one guess in as good as the other. It might have availed itself of a receivership \n\n[280 U.S. 291, 302]\n\u00a0\n but no one is wise enough to predict with any degree of certainty whether such a course would have meant ultimate recovery or final and complete collapse. If it had proceeded, or been proceeded against, under the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA), holders of the preferred stock might have paid or assumed the debts and gone forward with the business; or they might have considered it more prudent to accept whatever could be salvaged from the wreck and abandon the enterprise as a bad risk.\n As between these and all other alternatives, and the alternative of a sale such as was made, the officers, stockholders, and creditors, thoroughly familiar with the factors of a critical situation and more able than commission or court to foresee future contingencies, after much consideration, felt compelled to choose the latter alternative. There is no reason to doubt that in so doing they exercised a judgment which was both honest and well informed; and if aid be needed to fortify their conclusion, it may be found in the familiar presumption of rightfulness which attaches to human conduct in general. Bank of U. S. v. Dandridge, 12 Wheat. 64, 69. Aside from these considerations, the soundness of the conclusion which they reached finds ample confirmation in the facts already discussed and others disclosed by the record.\n In the light of the case thus disclosed of a corporation with resources so depleted and the prospect of rehabilitation so remote that it faced the grave probability of a business failure with resulting loss to its stockholders and injury to the communities where its plants were operated, we hold that the purchase of its capital stock by a competitor ( there being no other prospective purchaser), not with a purpose to lessen competition, but to facilitate the accumulated business of the purchaser and with the effect of mitigating seriously injurious consequences otherwise probable, is not in contemplation of law prejudicial to the public and does not substantially \n\n[280 U.S. 291, 303]\n\u00a0\n lessen competition or restrain commerce within the intent of the Clayton Act. To regard such a transaction as a violation of law, as this court suggested in United States v. U. S. Steel Corp., \n251 \nU.S. 417, 446\n, 447 S., 40 S. Ct. 293, 297, 8 A. L. R. 1121, would 'seem a distempered view of purchase and result.' See also American Press Ass'n v. United States (C. C. A.) 245 F. 91, 93. 94.\n For the reasons appearing under each of the two foregoing heads of this opinion, the judgment below must be\nREVERSED.\n\n Opinion of Mr. Justice STONE.\n That the facts found by the Commission are a violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 USCA  18) is not questioned. Under section 11, 38 Stat. 730 (U. S. Code, title 15,  21 (15 USCA  21)), the findings of the Commission, 'if supported by testimony' and the inferences which it may reasonably draw from the facts proved or admitted, are conclusive upon us. See Federal Trade Commission v. Pacific States Paper Ass'n, \n273 \nU.S. 52\n, 47 S. Ct. 255. Congress has thus forbidden the substitution of the judgment of courts for that of the Commission where it is founded upon evidence. Conforming to this requirement I cannot say that its conclusions here lack the prescribed support. Even without such statutory limitation this court will not set aside the findings of an administrative board or commission, upheld, as in the present case, by a unanimous court below, unless the record establishes that clear and unmistakable error has been committed. Cincinnati, H. & D. Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm., \n206 \nU.S. 142, 154\n, 27 S. Ct. 648; Cincinnati, N. O. & Texas Ry. v. Interstate Commerce Comm., \n162 \nU.S. 184, 194\n, 16 S. Ct. 700; Illinois Central R. R. v. Interstate Commerce Comm., \n206 \nU.S. 441, 466\n, 27 S. Ct. 700\n\n\n The opinion of the court and the general testimony of petitioner's officers of their conclusions that there was no competition between the two corporations (see United \n\n[280 U.S. 291, 304]\n\u00a0\n States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392\n, 47 S. Ct. 377, 50 A. L. R. 989) seem to proceed on the assumption that manufacturers, each engaged in marketing a product comparable in price and adapted to the satisfaction of the same need, do not compete if they do not sell to the same distributors.\n Without stating it in detail, there appears to me to be abundant evidence that the competitive products, made by two of the largest shoe manufacturers in the world, reached the same local communities through different agencies of distribution; the one, of petitioner, through sales directly to retailers throughout the United States, the other, of the McElwain Company, through sales in thirty-eight states, chiefly to wholesalers located in cities, who in turn sold to the retail trade. From detailed evidence of this type the Commission drew, as I think it reasonably might, the inference that the rival products, through local retailers, made their appeal to the same buying public and so were competitive. From a comparative study of the statistics of sales, the Commission might also, I think, reasonably have found that the McElwain Company was successfully competing, by securing by far the larger proportion of the trade in this type of shoe, its gross sales of dress shoes in 1920 being more than $33,000,000 and in 1921 more than $15,000, 000, as compared with petitioner's sales of its similar dress shoes of approximately $2,500,000.\n No useful purpose would be served by reviewing the evidence at length. To refer to only two of the many items which support the findings of the Commission, the fact relied upon, that petitioner, in the year ending May 31, 1921, sold only 52 5\/12 dozen pairs of the competing shoes to dealers patronizing the McElwain Company, would seem to be without significance in the light of other evidence that in one state, Missouri, where petitioner sold its product to 4,801 of the 5,150 retail shoe dealers in the state, the McElwain Company sold in the same \n\n[280 U.S. 291, 305]\n\u00a0\n year, chiefly through wholesalers and independent jobbers, 25,669 dozen pairs of the competing product. It appears that in 1921 petitioner sold its shoes to every retailer in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas. In that year, when the value of the gross sales of the McElwain Company had been cut in half by business depression, it sold in those states 8,791 dozen pairs of its competing product, chiefly through independent jobbers, in addition to its sales in that territory through wholesale houses at Columbus, Ohio, and Chicago.\n Apart from the more general testimony that both companies sold extensively in the same states and in the same cities, the inference from this evidence seems irresistible that in these states, as was the case in others,1 the competing products were not only offered through different systems of distribution to the same retailers, but were by them offered and sold to the ultimate consumers in their communities. Both products being made and suitable for the same use, the fact that each presented some minor advantages over the other, it might reasonably be inferred, would tend to increase, rather than diminish the competition. In fact, the chairman of petitioner's board of directors testified that its 500 salesmen were unsuccessful in their efforts to increase in sales of its Patriot Brand of dress shoes (the alleged competitive product) above about 3,000 pairs a day because they were unable to convince retailers of the superiority of petitioner's more serviceable dress shoes over the better \n\n[280 U.S. 291, 306]\n\u00a0\n looking dress shoes of the type manufactured by the McElwain Company.\n Nor am I able to say that the McElwain Company, for the stock of which petitioner gave its own stock having a market value of $9,460,000, was then in such financial straits as to preclude the reasonable inference by the Commission that its business, conducted either through a receivership or a reorganized company, would probably continue to compete with that of petitioner. See Standard Fashion Co. v. Magrane-Houston Co., \n258 \nU.S. 346, 356\n, 357 S., 42 S. Ct. 360. It plainly had large value as a going concern, there was no evidence that it would have been worth more or as much if dismantled, and there was evidence that the depression in the shoe trade in 1920-1921 was then a passing phase of the business. For these reasons and others stated at length in the opinion of the court below, I think the judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The petitioner sold to three retail dealers in every four in Illinois. The McElwain Company sold 9,547 dozen pairs of competing shoes to independent jobbers and retailers in that state. In addition, an affiliated wholesale house located in Chicago sold about 18,000 dozen pairs. In California, where the International Shoe Company sold to seven retail dealers in every ten, the McElwain Company sold 1,586 dozen pairs to retailers and independent jobbers; and an affiliated wholesaler located at San Francisco sold, almost wholly within the state, about 10,000 dozen pairs of the competing shoes. \n\n\n\n\n","65":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJACKSON v.

Y., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought in the Supreme Court of New York by respondent, a longshoreman, against William A. Jamison, an employing stevedore, to recover damages for personal injuries. Plaintiff was employed by defendant as a member of a crew loading a barge lying at Brooklyn in the navigable waters of the United States. One Curren was the forman in charge of the crew. While plaintiff was upon the barge engaged with \n\n[281 U.S. 635, 638]\n\u00a0\n others in loading it, the foreman struck and seriously injured him.\n The evidence showed that the foreman was authorized by the employer to direct the crew and to keep them at work. Plaintiff's evidence was sufficient to warrant a finding that the foreman assaulted him without provocation, and to hurry him about the work. The trial judge instructed the jury that the defendant would not be liable if the foreman assaulted plaintiff by reason of a personal difference but that, if the foreman, in the course of his employment, committed an unprovoked assault upon plaintiff in furtherance of defendant's work, plaintiff might recover. The jury returned a verdict for $2,500 in favor of plaintiff, and the court gave him judgment for that amount.\n The case was taken to the Appellate Division and there plaintiff invoked in support of the judgment section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, 46 U. S. C.,  688 (46 USCA  688), and the Federal Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, 45 U. S. C.,  51-59 (45 USCA  51-59). The court, 224 App. Div. 260, 230 N. Y. S. 16, held that plaintiff's injury was not the result of any negligence within the meaning of the latter act, and reversed the judgment.\n The Court of Appeals, 251 N. Y. 218, page 223, 167 N. E. 422, 423, held that the Federal Employers' Liability Act applies and, after quoting the language of this court in International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, \n272 \nU.S. 50, 52\n, 47 S. Ct. 19, said: 'As the word 'seamen' in the act ( 33, Merchant Marine Act) includes 'stevedores,' so the word 'negligence' ( 1, Federal Employers' Liability Act) should ... include 'misconduct.\" It reversed the judgment of the Appellate Division and affirmed that of the Supreme Court.\n Section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act (46 USCA  688) provides:\n'That any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by \n\n[281 U.S. 635, 639]\n\u00a0\n jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply. ...'\n\n Section 1 of the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51) provides:\n'That every common carrier by railroad while engaging in (interstate) commerce ... shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce ... for such injury ... resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier. ...'\n\n Plaintiff was a seaman within the meaning of section 33 ( International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, supra) and, as he sustained the injuries complained of while loading a vessel in navigable waters, the case is governed by the maritime law as modified by the acts of Congress above referred to. Northern Coal Co. v. Strand, \n278 \nU.S. 142\n, 49 S. Ct. 88; Panama R. R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375\n, 44 S. Ct. 391. He is entitled to recover if, within the meaning of section 1, his injuries resulted from the negligence of the foreman.\n The question is whether 'negligence' as there used includes the assault in question. The measure was adopted for the relief of a large class of persons employed in hazardous work in the service described. It abrogates the common-law rule that makes every employee bear the risk of injury or death through the fault or negligence of fellow servants, and applies the principle of respondeat superior (section 1), eliminates the defense of contributory negligence and substitutes of contributory negligence and substitutes a rule of comparative negligence (section 3 (45 USCA  53)), abolishes the defense of assumption of risk, where the violation of a statute enacted for the safety of employees is a contributing cause (section 4 (45 USCA  54)), and denounces all contracts, rules, and regulations calculated to exempt the employer from liability created by the act (section 5 (45 USCA  55)). \n\n[281 U.S. 635, 640]\n\u00a0\n The reports of the House and Senate committees having the bill in charge condemn the fellow-servant rule as operating unjustly when applied to modern conditions in actions against carriers to recover damages for injury or death of their employees, and show that a complete abrogation of that rule was intended. \n1\n The act, like an earlier similar one that was held invalid because it included subjects beyond the reach of Congress,2 is intended to stimulate carriers to greater diligence for the safety of their employees and of the persons and property of their patrons.

It is to be construed liberally to fulfill the purposes for which it was enacted, and to that end the word may be read to include all the meanings given to it by courts, and within the word as ordinarily used. Miller v. Robertson, \n266 \nU.S. 243, 248\n, 250 S., 45 S. Ct. 73.\n As the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) does not create liability without fault (Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 501\n, 34 S. Ct. 635, L. R. A. 1915C, 1, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475), it may reasonably be construed in contrast with proposals and enactments to make employers \n\n[281 U.S. 635, 641]\n\u00a0\n liable, in the absence of any tortious act, for the payment of compensation for personal injuries or death of employees arising in the course of their employment.\n'Negligence' is a word of broad significance and may not readily be defined with accuracy. Courts usually refrain from attempts comprehensively to state its meaning. While liability arises when one suffers injury as the result of any breach of duty owed him by another chargeable with knowledge of the probable result of his conduct, actionable negligence is often deemed-and we need not pause to consider whether rightly include other elements. Some courts call willful misconduct evincing intention or willingness to cause injury to another gross negligence. Bolin v. Chicago, etc., Railway Co., 108 Wis. 333, 84 N. W. 446, 81 Am. St. Rep. 911, and cases cited. And see Peoria Bridge Association v. Loomis, 20 Ill. 235, 251, 71 Am. Dec. 263; Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co. v. Hamler, 215 Ill. 525, 74 N. E. 705, 1 L. R. A. (N.

And it has been held that the use of excessive force causing injury to an employee by the superintendent of a factory in order to induce her to remain at work was not a trespass as distinguished from a careless or negligent act. Richard v. Company, 79 N. H. 380, 381, 109 A. 88, 8 A. L. R. 1426. While the assault of which plaintiff complains was in excess of the authority conferred by the employer upon the foreman, it was committed in the course of the discharge of his duties and in furtherance of the work of the employer's business. As unquestionably the employer would be liable if plaintiff's injuries had been caused by mere inadvertence or carelessness on the part of the offending foreman, it would be unreasonable and in conflict with the purpose of Congress to hold that the assault, a much graver breach of duty, was not negligence within the meaning of the act.

L. 736, as amended June 26, 1919, P. L. 642 (Pa. St. 1920,  21916 et seq.), the Pennsylvania Legislature provided for payment of compensation by employers to employees accidentally injured, without regard to fault, created an administrative board, and prescribed procedure for carrying the general plan into effect. The statute declares there shall be a conclusive presumption that both employer and employee accept its provisions, unless one of them makes written statement to the contrary. Every employer, liable to pay such compensation, unless exempted by the board, is required to insure payment in the state workmen's insurance fund or some authorized insurance company.\n Purporting to proceed under the statute, Abraham Span, appellee here, made application to the Workmen's Compensation Board for an award against the John Baizley Iron Works on account of accidental injuries. He alleged that, while employed by that concern, he suffered injury; the accident happened 'on ship Bald Hill on Delaware River, Phila., Pa., January 13, 1926,' when \n\n[281 U.S. 222, 229]\n\u00a0\n he was painting angle irons; both his eyes were affected by sparks from an acetylene torch in use by a fellow workman engaged in cutting iron; the business of the employer was 'iron works' and his occupation 'blacksmith helper.'\n The matter went to a referee, who took evidence, heard the parties, awarded compensation according to the statutory schedule, and directed appellant the Ocean Accident & Guarantee Comapny, Limited, insurer of the iron works, to pay the same. Upon successive appeals this award and judgment were approved by the Compensation Board, court of common pleas, Superior Court, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. For purposes of the appeal to the last, and as permitted by its rule, the parties substituted the following agreed statement of facts for all evidence produced at the hearing before the referee:\n'The claimant, Abraham Span, was at the time of the injuries in question, on January 13, 1926, a resident of Philadelphia and employed at Philadelphia by the defendant, John Baizley Iron Works. The defendant was engaged in performing certain repairs to the steamship 'Bald Hill,' at Philadelphia, including inter alia, the painting of the engine room and repairs to the floor of the engine room. The said vessel had prior thereto steamed to Philadelphia for necessary repairs, and at the time of the alleged accident was tied up to Pier 98 South in the Delaware River. The claimant, in the course of his aforesaid employment by the defendant, was painting angle irons in the engine room of the vessel. Sparks from an acetylene torch being used by a fellow employee working near claimant, entered the claimant's eyes and caused the injuries resulting in the alleged disability of the claimant.'\n\n The Supreme Court declared: 'In our opinion, the insurance carrier can be held to only such liabilities as may be imposed on the employer.' And it held that \n\n[281 U.S. 222, 230]\n\u00a0\n when injured, Span 'was doing work of a nature which had no direct relation to navigation or commerce.'\n The Bald Hill had steamed to Philadelphia for necessary repairs. She was a completed vessel, lying in navigable waters; the employer, iron works, was engaged in making repairs upon her painting the engine room and repairing the floor; the claimant went aboard in the course of his employment and was there engaged about the master's business when hurt. Obviously, considering what we have often said, unless the State Workmen's Compensation Act (Pa. St. 1920,  21916 et seq.) changed or modified the rules of the general maritime law, the rights and liabilities of both the employer and the employee in respect of the latter's injuries were fixed by those rules, and any cause arising out of them was within the admiralty jurisdiction.\n The insistence in behalf of appellee, Span, is that when hurt, he was doing work of a nature which had no direct relation to navigation or commerce; and to permit application of the State Workmen's Compensation Act would work no material prejudice to the essential features of the general maritime law as in Grant Smith-Porter Co. v. Rohde, \n257 \nU.S. 469\n, 42 S. Ct. 157, 25 A. L. R. 1008. But so to hold would conflict with principles which we have often announced. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Kierejewski, \n261 \nU.S. 479, 480\n, 481 S., 43 S. Ct. 418; Gonsalves v. Morse Dry Dock & Repair Co., \n266 \nU.S. 171, 172\n, 45 S. Ct. 39; Robins Dry Dock Co. v.

Rohde, supra, claimant when injured was working upon an incompleted vessel- \n\n[281 U.S. 222, 231]\n\u00a0\n a thing not yet placed into navigation and which had not become an instrumentality of commerce. In Millers' Indemnity Underwriters v. Braud, \n270 \nU.S. 59\n, 46 S. Ct. 194, the decedent met his death while cutting off piles driven into the land under navigable water. This had only remote relation to navigation or commerce. Sultan Ry. Co. v. Dept. of Labor, \n277 \nU.S. 135, 136\n, 137 S., 48 S. Ct. 505, had relation to the nature of the occupation of men engaged in logging operations.\n Kierejewski was a boiler maker employed by a Dredge Company to perform services as called upon. When hurt, he was making repairs upon a scow moored in navigable waters. We held this work had direct relation to navigation and commerce. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Kierejewski, supra.\n In Gonsalves v. Morse Dry Dock & Repair Co., supra, the injured workman was repairing the shell plates of a steamer then in a floating dock. The 'accident did not occur upon land.' and we held the rights of the parties must be determined under the maritime law.\n Robins Dry Dock & Repair Co. v. Dahl, supra, held that, as the employee was injured while repairing a completed vessel afloat in navigable waters, the right and liabilities of the parties depended upon the general maritime law, and could not be enlarged or impaired by the state statute.\n In Messel v. Foundation Co., supra, the claimant was injured while repairing a vessel afloat on the Missippi river. We said: 'The principles applicable to Messel's recovery, should he have one, must be limited to those which the admiralty law of the United States prescribes, including the applicable section of the federal Employers' Liability Act, incorporated in the maritime law by section 33, c. 250, 41 Stat. 988, 1007 ( 46 USCA  688).' \n\n[281 U.S. 222, 232]\n\u00a0\n See London Co. v. Industrial Commission, \n279 \nU.S. 109\n, 49 S. Ct. 296.\n Repairing a completed ship lying in navigable waters has direct and intimate connection with navigation and commerce, as has been often pointed out by this court.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n I think the judgment below should be affirmed on the authority of Rosengrant v. Havard, \n273 \nU.S. 664\n, 47 S. Ct. 454 (Feb. 28, 1927), which affirmed, without opinion but on the authority of Grant Smith- Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde, \n257 \nU.S. 469\n, 42 S. Ct. 157, 25 A. L. R. 1008, and Millers' Indemnity Underwriters v. Braud, \n270 \nU.S. 59\n, 46 S. Ct. 194, a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama, Ex parte Rosengrant, 213 Ala. 202, 104 So. 409; Ex parte Havard, 211 Ala. 605, 100 So. 897. In that case one employed as a lumber inspector by a lumber manufacturer, under a nonmaritime contract of employment, was injured in the course of his employment, while temporarily on board a schooner lying in navigable waters near his employer's mill. He was there engaged in checking a cargo of lumber then being discharged from a barge lying nearby, in navigable waters and alongside a wharf. Recovery for this injury under the local compensation law was allowed by the state court, on the ground that the contract of employment had no relation to navigation and was nonmaritime. This, like the Rosengrant Case, seems to differ from Northern Coal & Dock Co. v. Strand, \n278 \nU.S. 142\n, 49 S. Ct. 88, in that the employee was not a seaman within the meaning of the Jones Act (46 USCA  688).\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur. \n\n\n\n","68":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOHNSON v. U S SHIPPING BOARD EMERGENCY FLEET CORPORATION(1930)\nNo. 32\nArgued: Decided: January 6, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 320, 321]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Silas B.

Axtell, of New York City, for respondent Benjamin Lustgarten.\n The Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 320, 322]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n No. 5.\n August 1, 1920, petitioner was an unemployed seaman. The steamship Jacksonville, then lying in the port of Jacksonville, Florida, was a merchant vessel owned by the United States and operated for it by the Fleet Corporation. On that day, petitioner went aboard to seek employment, and, when returning to the shore, fell from the gangplank and suffered serious injuries. This is an action at law, brought by him in April, 1923, against the Fleet Corporation in the Supreme Court of New York to recover damages for such injuries. The complaint alleges that, due to the negligence of the defendant's officers and employees, the gangplank was insecure, and that plaintiff's injuries were caused thereby. The defendant removed the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Its answer denies the negligence charged in the complaint and alleges that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence; that, whatever his rights, plaintiff's remedy is provided exclusively by the Suits in Admiralty Act, approved March 9, 1920, 41 Stat. 525 (46 USCA  741 et seq.), and that his claim is barred because, as appears by the complaint, the action was not commenced within the two years prescribed by that act. The District Court submitted the case to a jury, and charged that, if guilty of contributory negligence, plaintiff could not recover. There was a verdict for defendant, and the judgment thereon was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 24 F. (2d) 963.\n No. 32.\n March 6, 1926, the steamship Coelleda was a merchant vessel owned by the United States and operated for it by the Navigation Company as agent, pursuant to an \n\n[280 U.S. 320, 323]\n\u00a0\n agreement made by the United States, acting through the Shipping Board represented by the Fleet Corporation. Merchant Marine Act 1920,  12, 35, 41 Stat. 993, 1007 (46 USCA  871, 886). Respondent was a seaman employed thereon. This is an action at law, brought by him in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, against the Fleet Corporation and the Navigation Company, to recover damages for injuries alleged to have been sustained by him while in that service. The complaint alleges two causes of action: (1) That, due to the negligent failure of defendants to furnish him a safe place in which to work, plaintiff was severely injured; and (2) that, being injured and in need of medical treatment and rent, he was refused such treatment by the master and officers of the ship, and was compelled to continue to work. The answer of each defendant denies the negligence and wrongful acts charged in the complaint, and alleges that, whatever his rights, plaintiff's remedy is provided exclusively by the Suits in Admiralty Act, and that therefore this action cannot be maintained. The trial court dismissed the first cause of action, and, after denying defendants' motion that a verdict in their favor be directed, submitted the second to a jury. There was a verdict for plaintiff, and the judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 28 F.(2d) 1014\n\n\n No. 56.\n The United States owned, and, through the Shipping Board and West India Steamship Company as agent, operated, the merchant vessel Cerosco. In February, 1920, at Sagua La Grande, Cuba, sugar was delivered to the vessel for transportation to New York and delivery there in accordance with bills of lading issued by the master. The vessel arrived in New York in the month following, but because some of the sugar was lost and some was \n\n[280 U.S. 320, 324]\n\u00a0\n damaged on the voyage, she failed to make delivery as agreed. January 5, 1924, this action was brought by petitioner in the District Court for the Southern District of New York against the United States, under the Tucker Act-Judicial Code,  24(20), 28 USCA  41(20)-to recover damages, less than $10,000, for failure to perform the contracts evidenced by the bills of lading. The trial court gave judgment for the defendant. The Circuit Court of Appeals, being of opinion that the limitations perscribed by the Suits in Admiralty Act governed, held that the action was too late and affirmed the judgment. 30 F.(2d) 254.\n No. 123.\n The steamship Eastern Glade was a merchant vessel owned by the United States and operated by the Fleet Corporation. Merchandise was delivered to the vessel at New York for transportation to various destinations and delivery upon the orders of the consignees. Two actions, one by underwriters and the other by owners, were brought against the Fleet Corporation in the Supreme Court of New York to recover for loss and damage of cargo alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendant. The cause es of action accrued in December, 1922. The suits were not commenced until September 7, 1928, long after the expiration of the period of limitations fixed by the Suits in Admiralty Act, but within the six years allowed by the New York statute. Section 48, New York Civil Practice Act. Defendant removed the suits to the District Court for the Southern District of New York where they were consolidated. The case was tried by the court without a jury upon the complaints and a stipulation which provided that defendant should be deemed by appropriate pleadings to have raised the objection that the Suits in Admiralty Act affords an exclusive remedy for all causes of action for which a libel \n\n[280 U.S. 320, 325]\n\u00a0\n in admiralty may be filed thereunder. The court held that the remedy provided by the act is exclusive and dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction. 30 F.(2d) 946. Plaintiff appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. We granted this writ before the determination of the case in that court.\n In each of these cases there is involved the question whether the Suits in Admiralty Act excludes the remedy invoked by plaintiff.\n Section 1, Suits in Admiralty Act (46 USCA  741), in view of the provision made of libel in personam, prevents the arrest or seizure by judicial process of any vessel owned by, in the possession of or operated by or for the United States or any corporation in which the United States or its representatives own the entire outstanding capital stock. Section 2 of that act (46 USCA  742) declares that, in cases where, if such vessel were privately owned or operated, a proceeding in admiralty could be maintained 'at the time of the commencement of the action herein provided for,' a libel in personam may be brought against the United States or against such corporation, provided that such vessel is employed as a merchant vessel. The pertinent provisions of the act are printed in the margin of our opinion in Fleet Corporation v. Rosenberg Bros., \n276 U.S. 202\n, 209, et seq., 48 S. Ct. 256.\n Prior to the passage of the act, merchant vessels of the United States were subject to seizure. Section 9, Shipping Act September 7, 1916, 39 Stat. 730 (46 USCA  808). The Lake Monroe, \n250 \nU.S. 246\n, 39 S. Ct. 460. And the Fleet Corporation was liable to be sued in state or federal courts on causes of action arising out of the operation of such ships. Cf. Sloan Shipyards v. U. S. Fleet Corp., \n258 \nU.S. 549\n, 42 S. Ct. 386. The act relieved the United States of the inconvenience resulting from such seizures and gave remedy by libel in personam against the United States and such corporations. Blamberg Bros. v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 452, 458\n, 43 S. Ct. 179. But \n\n[280 U.S. 320, 326]\n\u00a0\n that is not its only purpose. It authorizes libel in personam where there is nothing on which recovery in rem could be had. Eastern Transp. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 675\n, 47 S. Ct. 289. And it furnishes the exclusive remedy in admiralty against the United States and such corporations on maritime causes of action arising out of the possession and operation of merchant vessels. In Fleet Corporation v. Rosenberg Bros., supra, we said, at page 213 of 276 U. S., 48 S. Ct. 258:\n'It provides a remedy in admiralty for adjudicating and satisfying all maritime claims arising out of the possession or operation of merchant vessels of the United States and the corporations, in which the obligation of the United States is substituted for that of the corporations. To that end it furnishes a complete system of administration, applying to the United States and the corporations alike, by which uniformity is established as to venue, service of process, rules of decision and procedure, rate of interest, and periods of limitation; and not only provides that the judgments against the corporations, as well as those against the United States, shall be paid out of money in the Treasury, but repeals the inconsistent provisions of all other acts. In view of these provisions of the act we cannot doubt that it was intended to furnish the exclusive remedy in admiralty against the United States and the corporations on all maritime causes of action arising out of the possession or operation of merchant vessels. And nothing in its legislative history indicates a different purpose. It follows that after the passage of the act no libel in admiralty could be maintained against the United States or the corporations on such causes of action except in accordance with its provisions. ...'\n\n On the facts above stated it is clear that each of the causes of action arose out of the possession or operation of a merchant vessel by or for the United States. Directly or mediately, the money required to pay a judg- \n\n[280 U.S. 320, 327]\n\u00a0\n ment against any of the defendant in these cases would come out of the United States. It is the real party affected in all of these actions. Section 8, Suits in Admiralty Act (46 USCA  748). Cf. Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373, 385\n, 22 S. Ct. 650.\n The analysis of the act and the reasons on which rests our decision in Fleet Corporation v. Rosenberg Bros. apply here. Putting the United States and the Fleet Corporation on the same footing and providing remedies to be exclusive in admiralty would not serve substantially to establish uniformity, if suits under the Tucker Act and in the Court of Claims be allowed against the United States, and actions at law in state and federal courts be permitted against the Fleet Corporation or other agents for enforcement of the maritime causes of action covered by the act. Such a failure of purpose on the part of the Congress is not readily to be inferred. We conclude that the remedies given by the act are exclusive in all cases where a libel might be filed under it. As shown above, section 2 authorizes a libel in personam against the United States or against the Fleet Corporation in each of these cases. It follows that on disclosure- whether by pleading or proof-of the facts aforesaid, the District Court should have dismissed each case for lack of jurisdiction.\n Judgments in Nos. 5, 32, and 56 reversed, and causes remanded, with directions to dismiss.\n Judgment in No. 123 affirmed. \n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKANSAS CITY SOUTHERN RY. CO. v. GUARDIAN TRUST CO.(1930)\nNo. 22\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Samuel W. Moore, of New York City, and F. H. Moore, Cyrus Crane, and A. F. Smith, all of Kansas City, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. Justin D. Bowersock, of Kansas City, Mo., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether the Guardian Trust Company, in addition to amounts taxable as costs between party and party, is entitled to recover anything on account of counsel fees or other expenses as costs between solicitor and client.\n In a judgment creditor's suit brought in the United States Circuit Court for the Western District of Missouri by the Cambria Steel Company against the Kansas City Suburban Belt Railroad Company, receivers were appointed for the latter. It had given its notes for large amounts to the Trust Company and pledged stocks and bonds as collateral security. The Kansas City Southern Railway Company had acquired on mortgage forecloures the properties of the Belt Company, and of the Kansas City, Pittsburg & Gulf Railroad Company.\n The Trust Company claimed that the Southern Company, having succeeded to the properties of the Belt Company and of the Gulf Company on terms that preferred shareholders to creditors, became liable for their \n\n[281 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n debts. \n1\n It brought three suits in a Missouri court to compel the Southern Company to pay the debts owing to it by them. Thereupon the Southern Company brought two suits against the Trust Company in the United States court to enjoin prosecution of the state court cases. One related to the actions on the debts of the Belt Company ((C. C. A.) 146 F. 337), and the other to all the actions. (C. C. A.) 171 F. 43, 28 L. R. A. (N. S.) 620. Injunctions granted by the lower court were dissolved by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n In the creditor's suit, the Belt Company and its receivers filed an ancillary bill against the Trust Company to have the claims of the latter against the former declared invalid, to recover the collateral security, and to have an accounting. The Southern Company intervened, claiming under the foreclosure, and sought to recover the collateral security and other property from the Trust Company. The decree of the Circuit Court, except as to matters not important here, denied relief against the Trust Company, established its claims against the Belt Company and, notwithstanding the Trust Company's contention that the issue was not before the court, adjudged that the Southern Company was not liable therefor, and ordered that one-third of the costs be borne by the Trust Company and two-thirds by the Southern and Belt Companies.\n The matters adjudged in favor of the Trust Company were not taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for review. The Trust Company appealed. It insisted that the lower court erred in holding that the Southern Company was not indebted to it. Preferring to pursue that company in the actions pending in the state court, it had not prayed judgment in this suit against the Southern Company. It \n\n[281 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n also maintained that the lower court erred in holding it liable for any part of the costs.\n After the case had been argued and submitted, but before opinion was announced, owners of a small minority of the shares of the Trust Company were permitted to file a suggestion that the Trust Company should have judgment against the Southern Company for the debt of the Belt Company. The court reversed the decree below, decided the Southern Company became liable for that debt, postponed for further argument the question whether under the pleadings the Trust Company might have judgment therefor, and held it was entitled to recover its entire costs. Central Improvement Co. v. Cambria Steel Co., 201 F. 811, 829.\n Later the same stockholders by leave of the Circuit Court of Appeals filed, and at the final submission of the case were heard in support of, the following suggestions:\n That the court embody in its order for reversal a special finding that the creditor's bill, ancillary bill, and intervening petition were instigated, and prosecuted by and for the Southern Company without good faith, and that the entire litigation was trivial, wanton, and oppressive. That it direct the lower court to reserve jurisdiction to ascertain the amount of solicitors' fees and other expenses necessarily incurred by the Trust Company in making its defenses, to find the amount of such expenses, tax them as costs in the case and enter a further decree against the Southern Company therefor. Or in the alternative that the final decree below be without prejudice to the right of the Trust Company to sue the Southern Company for such expenses. That such additional decree also include the expenses and damages incurred by and resulting to the Trust Company from the second injunction suit (171 F. 43, 28 L. R. A. (N. S.) 620) and that it be without prejudice to the rights of the Trust Company to move for such damages and expenses in the first injunction suit. 146 F. 337. \n\n[281 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n In its second opinion the Circuit Court of Appeals dealt with these suggestions. Central Improvement Co. v. Cambria Steel Co., 210 F. 696. It said at page 723:\n'A deliberate consideration of this petition and of the exhaustive arguments of counsel have, however, persuaded that inasmuch as the questions suggested came for the first time into this suit at the rehearing in this court, as no evidence has been taken relative to them, and as the evidence upon the issues tried in this case was not brought to this court, it would be unwise and might be unjust to adjudicate the questions presented by the petition of these stockholders. Moreover, as this court cannot rightly determine the questions relating to the costs to be taxed at this time, as there are established rules of practice concerning them, and as directions to the court below to open and try new issues might, and probably would, prolong this litigation through several years more, our conclusion is that our just course is to leave the taxation of costs to the court below under the principles, rules, and practice in equity.' And, 'as a conclusion of the whole matter,' it gave directions for the entry of a specific decree with 'costs.'\n\n And the court adjudged that the decree of the lower court be reversed and remanded the case 'with directions to render a decree for the Trust Company in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion of this Court.' The Southern Company appealed, but did not raise any question concerning costs. And there was no cross-appeal. February 21, 1916, this court affirmed the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals. \n240 \nU.S. 166\n, 36 S. Ct. 334. The mandate set out the decree below, ordered that it be affirmed, and remanded the case to the District Court.\n April 15, 1916, pending exact determination of the amount conceded to be payable under the decree, the Southern Company paid $821,623.28 to the Trust Company. Later, the payment being found in excess of the \n\n[281 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n amount required, the difference was adjusted. April 18, 1916, the mandate was filed in the District Court. October 4, 1922, the Trust Company applied to have final decree entered, and claimed not only such costs as are taxable as between party and party but also counsel fees and other expenses as costs between solicitor and client. The court construed the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals to find that in carrying on this litigation there was lack of good faith and a purpose on the part of the Southern Company to despoil the Trust Company, held itself bound by such findings, and interpreted the decree to require it to ascertain and tax against the Southern Company counsel fees and other expenses incurred by the Trust Company in making its defenses.\n A special master was appointed to ascertain and report the amount of such expenses. The Trust Company presented items of its demand in two groups. The first included those claimed to be taxable as between party and party; the second included other expenses amounting to $319,829.97 of which $299,137.30 was attorneys' fees, the balance being to cover printing briefs, services of experts, miscellaneous and incidental disbursements. The master found the costs taxable as between party and party and as to that there is no controversy here. He also found the Trust Company entitled to counsel fees and other expenses amounting to $296,520.37 to be taxed as costs between solicitor and client. After hearing upon exceptions the court, contrary to its earlier decision, held that the proper construction of the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals limited recovery of costs to those taxable between party and party, and entered decree accordingly.\n The Trust Company again appealed. The Circuit Court of Appeals, apparently assuming that its decree and the mandate of this court authorized the District Court to allow the Trust Company costs as between solicitor and client, reversed the decree. 28 F.(2d) 233. It \n\n[281 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n referred to the character of the litigation, held that federal courts of equity have jurisdiction to allow such costs, citing the practice in the High Court of Chancery in England as applicable here, concluded that the Trust Company is entitled to such an allowance, and remanded the case, with directions to the lower court to make proper allowances for costs as between solicitor and client.\n Did the mandate of this court authorize the District Court to make any allowance in favor of the Trust Company on account of attorneys' fees and other expenses to be taxed as costs between solicitor and client?\n The decree here affirmed required the 'taxation of costs ... under the principles, rules, and practice in equity.' It undoubtedly covered ascertainment of amounts taxable between party and party. There was no specific reference to any additional allowance. The language used disclosed no intention to require more than the usual taxation. When used in a judgment or decree without qualification, the word 'costs' means the amounts taxable as such under Acts of Congress, rules promulgated by its authority and practice established consistently with governing enactments.

In actions at law costs follow the result as of course, but in equity costs not otherwise governed by statute are given or withheld in the sound discretion of the court according to the facts and circumstances of the case. The nominal amounts fixed by statute (28 U. S. C.  571, 572 (28 USCA  571, 572)), and taxable as attorneys' fees, are not meant to cover the compensation to which lawyers in charge of the litigation are reasonably entitled. A decree merely allowing costs to be taxed does not mean that anything is to be included on account of counsel fees in addition to the amount specified in the statute. Even if it be assumed that federal equity courts have jurisdiction to allow costs as between solicitor and client and to include \n\n[281 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n therein attorneys' fees in excess of the amount prescribed by statute-and as to that we express no opinion-the purpose to authorize such costs and to make such allowance should be clearly expressed in the decree. 2 Daniell's Chancery Pleading and Practice (6th Ed.) p. 1410\n\n\n For the proper construction of the decree under consideration, regard is to be had to the issues before the court on appeal, the findings applied for and the directions given. The proposed findings and additional recovery extended to matters not before the court. The costs taxable as between party and party were involved on the appeal, and the court reversed the decree of the lower court which charged one-third against the Trust Company. No question of costs as between solicitor and client had been raised below. No issue of bad faith had been framed, and no such charge was suggested until after the filing of the first opinion. The stockholders' second application, made pending rehearing, contained the first request for a finding of fact on which to base a decree for allowance of attorneys' fees and other expenses to the Trust Company. As there was no appeal by the Belt Company or the Southern Company, the merits of the claims on which they sought recovery against the Trust Company were not before the court.\n The lateness of the application, the lack of evidence and danger of injustice mantioned in the opinion were good reasons why the court should deny the application. The suggested danger of prolonging the litigation by trial of new issues was a reason for refusing to direct the lower court to open the case and to make the requested determinations. The failure of the court to make the requested special finding, to adopt the alternative suggestion, or to take any action in reference to the parts of the application relating to the Trust Company's damages and expenses in the injunction suits goes to show a purpose to deny any recovery of expenses in addition to the costs \n\n[281 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n which under established practice are taxable as between party and party. And the opinion makes it clear that the decree directed to be entered below was intended to be an end of the whole matter. It is plain that the stockholders' application was denied and that the decree did not authorize or permit the taxation of costs as between solicitor and client.\n The mandate required the execution of the decree. The District Court could not vary it or give any further relief. In re Sanford Fork & Tool Co ., \n160 \nU.S. 247, 255\n, 16 S. Ct. 291; Gaines v. Rugg, \n148 \nU.S. 228, 241\n, 13 S.

That court was right in holding that, by the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals and the mandate of this court, the costs recoverable by the Trust Company were limited to those taxable between party and party.\n Decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, and that of the District Court affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Northern Pacific Ry. v.

BOARD OF TAX SUP'RS OF JEFFERSON COUNTY, KY.(1930)\nNo. 11\nArgued: Decided: November 24, 1930\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edmund F. Trabue and Homer W. Batson, both of Louisville, Ky., for appellant.\n Messrs. M. B. Holifield, of Mayfield, Ky., and Samuel B. Kirby, Jr., of Louisville, Ky., for appellee.[ Klein v. Board of Tax Sup'rs of Jefferson County, Ky. \n282 U.S. 19\n (1930) ]\n\n\n[282 U.S. 19, 22]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky affirming the validity of a State tax and the constitutionality of the statutes under which the tax was imposed. 230 Ky. 182, 18 S.W.(2d) 1009\n\n\n Holders of stock in a corporation generally are required to list their shares for taxation, but it is provided that 'the individual stockholders of a corporation, at lease seventy-five per cent (75%) of whose total property is taxable in Kentucky, shall not be required to list their shares for taxation so long as the corporation pays taxes on all its property in Kentucky,' etc. Kentucky Statutes,  4088 (Ed. Carroll, 1930), Acts 1924, c. 116,  2, pp. 402, 406. The appellant contends that this section makes the tax contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. The appellant owned shares in the Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company, a New Jersey corporation, less than seventy-five per cent of whose total property was taxable in Kentucky. He was taxed as contemplated and he says that the discrimination between himself and holders of stock in a corporation paying taxes on more than seventy-five per cent of all their property is arbitrary and denies to him the equal protection of the laws.\n This contention was so thoroughly disposed of by the Court of Appeals that it is not necessary to deal with the \n\n[282 U.S. 19, 23]\n\u00a0\n argument for the appellees that if section 4088, is invalid the general tax law stands unaffected and unqualified and the appellant still must pay the tax. It will be enough to present an abridgement of the considerations that prevailed. There is no doubt that a State may tax a corporation and also tax the holders of its stock. Tennessee v. Whitworth, \n117 \nU.S. 129, 136\n, 6 S. Ct. 645. The owners are different and, although the appellant calls it a mischievous fiction, the property is different. While no doubt the property and expectations of the corporation are the backbone of the value of the shares, yet the latter may get additional value from another source. In this case the appellant alleges that the price of shares was much enhanced by rumors of a stock dividend, which of course would have added nothing to the property of the corporation. On the other hand there is no constitutional obligation to tax both the corporation and the holders of its stock. See Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 \nU.S. 730, 732\n, 23 S. Ct. 401, 47 L. Ed. . If the corporation having all its property in the State has paid taxes upon the whole, usually it would be just not to tax the stockholders in respect of values derived from what already has borne its share. And what would be true in the case supposed would be true when the corporation was paying for the great body of its property although some small fraction happened to be outside of the State. Thus we come to the usual question of degree and of drawing a line where no important distinction can be seen between the nearest points on the two sides, but where the distinction between the extremes is plain. Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349, 355\n, 28 S. Ct. 529, 14 Ann. Cas. 560. Numerous illustrations are cited by the Court below, e. g., McLean v. Arkansas, \n211 \nU.S. 539, 551\n, 29 S. Ct. 206; Booth v. Indiana, \n237 \nU.S. 391, 397\n, 35 S. Ct. 617; Miller v. Strahl, \n239 \nU.S. 426, 434\n, 36 S. Ct. 147.\n We agree with the Court of Appeals that there could have been no question if the statute had said ninety per cent and that fixing seventy- five was equally plainly 'a \n\n[282 U.S. 19, 24]\n\u00a0\n reasonable effort to do justice to all in view of the way all our other assessments are made.'\n The appellant, pursuing his notion that shares of stock represent an interest in the property of the corporation insists that if taxed at all he should be taxed only in the ratio of the property in the State of the entire property of the corporation; that to tax him for the whole value is to tax property outside of the jurisdiction of the State. But it leads nowhere to call a corporation a fiction. If it is a fiction it is a fiction created by law with intent that it should be acted on as if true. The corporation is a person and its ownership is a nonconductor that makes it impossible to attribute an interest in its property to its members. Donnell v. Herring-Hall-Marvin Safe Co., \n208 \nU.S. 267, 273\n, 28 S. Ct. 288. The stockholders in some circumstances can call on the corporation to account, but that is a very different thing from having an interest in the property by means of which the corporation is enabled to settle the account. The principle of justice that leads to the exemption that has been dealt with could not be insisted upon as a matter of constitutional right and it is reasonable for the legislature to confine it to well marked cases, rather than to press it to a logical extreme. Of course it does not matter here that in an earlier year the exemption was greater than now.\n It in alleged as a distinct point of objection, though perhaps less earnestly pressed, that appellant's stock was assessed at its full selling price whereas land was taxed at seventy-five per cent of its sale value. There is nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment that requires land and stock to be taxed at the same rate or by the same tests and the Court of Appeals thinks that the Board of Tax Commissioners 'judged that seventy-five per cent of the sale values represented about fairly the cash value of real estate.' Whether this be so or not we see no constitutional ground for complaint.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKOTHE v. R. C. TAYLOR TRUST(1930)\nNo. 48\nArgued: December 4, 1929Decided: January 6, 1930\n\n\n\n Mr. Frank H. Pardee, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Messrs. George S. Taft and Thomas Hovey Gage, both of Worcester, Mass ., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n April 20, 1927, respondent-the R. C. Taylor Trust-leased to one Turkel certain real estate, reserving rent at the rate of $4,000 per annum. The meager record before \n\n[280 U.S. 224, 225]\n\u00a0\n us does not affirmatively show the length of the term, but we accept the statement by counsel for both sides that it was two years. The lease contained the following provision:\n'The filing of any petition in bankruptcy ... by or against the lessee shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this lease, and thereupon, ipso facto and without entry or other action by the lessor, this lease shall become and be terminated; and, notwithstanding any other provisions of this lease the lessor shall forthwith upon such termination be entitled to recover damages for such breach in an amount equal to the amount of the rent reserved in this lease for the residue of the term thereof.'\n\n Turkel having been adjudged bankrupt, the lessor filed proof of debt for $5,000, demanded as 'damages for breach of lease, ... that being the same as the amount of rent reserved in the lease from February 15, 1928 to May 15, 1929, the end of the term.'\n The referee disallowed the claim, 'for the reason that the proof is based on damages for the amount of rent running from the date of the filing of the petition to the end of the term of the lease, no part of such claim being for any rent which had accrued at the time of the filing of said bankruptcy petition.' The District Court affirmed his action; but the court below held the claim valid and allowable under section 63a(4) of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, 30 Stat. 563 (USCA title 11, c. 7,  103(a).\n The trustee, petitioner here, maintains that the quoted provision of the lease imposed a penalty and did not express any lawful purpose to fix the liquidated damages which might follow failure to perform. On the other hand, the respondent insists that in view of the length of the term the agreement must be regarded as one for liquidated damages and therefore unobjectionable.\n Sun Printing & Publishing Assn. v. Moore, \n183 \nU.S. 642\n, 22 S. Ct. 240 and United States v. Bethlehem Steel Co., 205 U. S. \n\n[280 U.S. 224, 226]\n\u00a0\n 105, 119, 27 S. Ct. 450, point out principles applicable to enforcement of contracts providing for payment of definite sums upon failure to perform. The courts are 'strongly inclined to allow parties to make their own contracts, and to carry out their intentions, even when it would result in the recovery of an amount stated as liquidated damages, upon proof of the violation of the contract, and without proof of the damages actually sustained. ... The question always is, what did the parties intend by the language used? When such intention is ascertained it is ordinarily the duty of the court to carry it out.' And see United States v. United Engineering Co., \n234 \nU.S. 241\n, 34 S. Ct. 843, 845: 'Such contracts for liquidated damages, when reasonable in their character, are not to be regarded as penalties, and may be enforced between the parties.' But agreements to pay fixed sums plainly without reasonable relation to any probable damage which may follow a breach will not be enforced. This circumstance tends to negative any notion that the parties really meant to provide a measure of compensation-'to treat the sum named as estimated and ascertained damages.'\n Here, we find the lessee in a lease for two years agreeing that the mere filing of a petition in bankruptcy against him shall be deemed a breach and thereupon, ipso facto, it shall be terminated and the lessor shall become entitled to re-enter also to recover damages equal to the full amount of the rent reserved for the remainder of the term. The amount thus stipulated is so disproportionate to any damage reasonably to be anticipated in the circumstances disclosed that we must hold the provision is for an unenforceable penalty. The parties were consciously undertaking to contract for payment to be made out of the assets of a bankrupt estate- not for something which the lessee personally would be required to discharge. He, therefore, had little, if any, immediate concern with the amount of the claim to be presented; most probably, that \n\n[280 U.S. 224, 227]\n\u00a0\n would affect only those entitled to share in the proceeds of property beyond his control.\n The broad purpose of the Bankruptcy Act is to bring about an equitable distribution of the bankrupt's estate among creditors holding just demands based upon adequate consideration. Any agreement which tends to defeat that beneficent design must be regarded with disfavor. Considering the time which the lease here involved had to run, nothing else appearing, it seems plain enough that the real design of the challenged provision was to insure to the lessor preferential treatment in the event of bankruptcy. The record discloses no circumstance sufficient to support a contrary view. If the term were much shorter, or there were facts tending to disclose a proper purpose, the argument in favor of the lessor would be more persuasive.\n The decree of the court below must be reversed. The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed and the cause remanded there for further appropriate proceedings.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","72":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLAWS v.

In the first named, No. 19, in the Ninth Circuit, the decision was for the defendant, 34 F.(2d) 764, affirming the decree of the District Court, 27 F.(2d) 758, and declining to follow the Third Circuit's decision in Lektophone Corporation v. Brandes Products Corporation, 20 F.(2d) 155. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court, \n280 \nU.S. 551\n, 50 S. Ct. 162. Later the second of the suits before us, No. 68, was brought in the Third Circuit, and the District Court, in obedience to the precedent there, decided for the plaintiff, 37 F.(2d) 580. An appeal was takento the Circuit Court of Appeals. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court without the formality of awaiting the result. \n281 \nU.S. 713\n, 50 S. Ct. 355\n\n\n The patent is No. 1,271,529, granted July 2, 1918, to Hopkins, assignor, by mesne assignments, to the Lektophone Corporation; the original application having been filed July 14, 1913, in the time of the phonograph and before the days of radio, for an 'Improvement in Acoustic Devices.' The object is the 'direct propagation, in free air, from a record or equivalent element subjected to the action of the original sound waves or vibrations, of self-sustaining sound waves substantially corresponding in intesity and amplitude, as well as in pitch or timbre, to the said original sound waves'; as distinguished from the then prevailing use of the sound box and horn. The device, as set forth in claim 8, comprised 'a tympanum embodying a bodily movable, central conical portion, and an annular rim which encircles said conical portion and which is rigidly supported, said conical portion being freely exposed on all sides to unconfined air and being of sufficient area to produce self-sustaining sound waves in the surrounding air when vibrated.' On the question \n\n[282 U.S. 168, 170]\n\u00a0\n what is a sufficient area the patent says, 'If satisfactory regeneration by sounds from a record or other sound-vibrated element is to be had, the whole diameter of the tympanum, that is, the diameter of the aperture in the rings (that rigidly clamp the edges of the tympanum) should exceed nine inches.' 'The diameter of the base of said conical portion should be at least eight-tenths of the diameter of the said aperture'-with further details. Paper is pronounced a satisfactory material, the requirement being that it should be crisp and strong and have considerable rigidity within itself.\n The state of the art at and before 1913 will be found in the cases already cited, two excellent discussions by Thacher, D. J., in Lektophone Corporation v. Western Electric Co. (D. C.) 20 F.(2d) 150, and Hickenlooper, D. J., in Lektophone Corporation v. Crosley Radio Corporation, 46 F.(2d) 126; Southern District of Ohio, and in the English case of Lektophone Corporation v. S. G. Brown, Ltd., Ch. Div., January 23, 1929; Court of Appeals, July 12, 1929. It is unnecessary to repeat, because it is conceded that the conical tympanum and material were known in connection with a sound box for the phonograph of which Hopkins was thinking, as shown by the words 'from a record' quoted from the patent. The effect of increasing the size of the cone also was known. The contribution of Hopkins, if he made one, as held in several cases in the lower Courts and abroad, was to combine abandoning the sound box, determining the size of the cone deemed by him most suitable to reproduce the sounds communicated to it by vibration, and tightly gripping and rigidly supporting the outer edge of the above-mentioned annular rim of the cone between two rings. A result claimed for the rigid support, although seemingly not thought of at the time, is to avoid interfering sounds, 'blasting' and ratting, that were made when the edge of \n\n[282 U.S. 168, 171]\n\u00a0\n the cone was loose. As said by Hickenlooper, J., 'All of these elements in combination went to make up the novelty of his alleged invention.' 'To the size, shape and proportion thus disclosed the patentee is limited by the prior art and the very essence of his invention.' If the patent was valid it must be confined narrowly to the combination described.\n In No. 19 the defendant's device is very like that of the plaintiff but differs in at least one particular. The plaintiff's cone, of crisp, strong, more or less rigid material, is continued in one piece under the rings that give it a rigid support. Its tympanum includes this outer edge. On the other hand, as said by Judge Thacher about another contrivance, 'the defendant's structure, although it comprises a tympanum support having a circular aperture, does not comprise a tympanum having its outer edge rigidly mounted on said support in said aperture within the meaning of claim 4. Nor does it comprise an annular rim which encircles the conical portion of the tympanum within the meaning of claim 8.' Lektophone Corporation v. Western Electric Co. (D. C.) 20 F.(2d) 150, 154. The defendant's tympanum is only the paper cone, distinct from the rim. The rim is made of limp leather. In view of the importance attached to this element in the plaintiff's patent it is impossible to say that it is infringed. To quote again from the last cited case, 'to hold that the defendant's device comprises a 'tympanum rigidly supported at its periphery,' within the meaning of the claims, contrary to the plain import of their terms;' and the Judge refers to experiments that showed the difference in function of the two devices. Id. There are other questions that would have to be answered before the plaintiff could prevail, such as the difference in size, argued in this case, (D. C.) 27 F.(2d) 758, 760; Id., on appeal, 34 F.(2d) 764, 773; the size being regarded by Hopkins as of the essence of his invention. But we think the matter too plain to need \n\n[282 U.S. 168, 172]\n\u00a0\n more words. The same conclusion applies to the second case where the rim is made of cloth.\n Decree in No. 19 affirmed.\n Decree in No. 68 reversed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the decision of these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] For amendment of opinion, see 51 S.

Vinson, both of Houston, Tex., for petitioner. \n\n[281 U.S. 233, 234]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Sam C. Polk and D. A. Simmons, both of Houston, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In January, 1927, while regularly employed by the Ford Motor Company and 'open for any kind of work' Hal Cook was instructed as 'a part of his contract of em- \n\n[281 U.S. 233, 235]\n\u00a0\n ployment to assist in unloading cargo off' the steamship Lake Gorian, lately arrived at Houston, Tex., from the high seas and then tied up at the dock. While at work in the hold of the vessel, he received serious injuries, from which it is asserted he died March 28th.\n The Ford Motor Company carried a policy of workmen's compensation insurance with the petitioner, Employers' Liability assurance Corporation, Limited, of London, England, which undertook to protect the assured against loss by reason of injuries to its employees.\n Purporting to proceed under the Workmen's Compensation Act of Texas ( Rev. St. Tex. 1925, arts. 8306-8309) respondents presented to the Industrial Accident Board a claim for compensation because of Cook's death against both the motor company and the insurer. This was denied upon the ground that the death 'was due to a condition in no way incident to or associated with his employment.' As permitted by the statute, respondents refused to abide by the action of the board and brought suit in the state court.\n They alleged: 'While in the course of his employment, said Hal Cook was instructed by said Ford Motor Company to assist in unloading a ship or vessel belonging to the said Ford Motor Company then anchored at the Wharves at Houston Ship Channel at Houston, Texas, and while so engaged said Hal Cook suffered severe injuries in that while he and other employees of the said Ford Motor Company were unloading from said ship the cargo thereon, consisting of axles and various other parts of automobiles and transferring the same to the wharves where said ship was anchored, the said Hal Cook while lifting said automobile parts, received a severe strain to the internal muscles of his back, ...' which caused his death.\n They asked for judgment setting aside the award of the board and for compensation as provided by the statute. \n\n[281 U.S. 233, 236]\n\u00a0\n The cause was removed to the United States District Court. It heard the evidence, denied a motion for an instructed verdict in favor of the petitioner, submitted the matter to a jury, and, upon a verdict in respondents' favor, entered judgment. Appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which held: 'We think it fairly can be said that the matter of unloading these two ships of the Ford Motor Company at rare intervals was 'of mere local concern, and its regulation by the state will work no material prejudice to any ... feature of the general maritime law.\"\n The record plainly discloses that, while in the course of his employment and at work in the hold assisting in unloading a vessel afloat on navigable waters, Cook received injuries out of which this suit arose. There is nothing in principle to differentiate this case from Northern Coal Co. v. Strand, \n278 \nU.S. 142\n, 49 S. Ct. 88, and the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed. See Nogueira v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., \n281 \nU.S. 128\n, 50 S. Ct. 303, 74 L. Ed. -, decided this day.\n The proceeding to recover under the State Compensation Act necessarily admitted that the decedent was employed by the insured when injured. Any right of recovery against the insurance carrier depends upon the liability of the assured. Whether Cook's employment contemplated that he should work regularly in unloading vessels or only when specially directed so to do is not important. The unloading of a ship is not matter of purely local concern as we have often pointed out. Under the circumstances disclosed, the state lacked power to prescribe the rights and liabilities of the parties growing out of the accident. The fact that the Compensation Law of the state was elective in form does not aid the respondents. The employer did not surrender rights \n\n[281 U.S. 233, 237]\n\u00a0\n guaranteed to him by the federal law merely by electing to accept one of two kinds of liability in respect of matters within the state's control, either of which she had power to impose upon him.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed. The cause will be remanded for further proceedings i conformity with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n As the court, in Northern Coal & Dock Co. v. Strand, \n278 \nU.S. 142\n, 49 S. Ct. 88, held that one engaged as a stevedore in unloading a ship lying in navigable waters is a seaman within the meaning of the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 USCA  688; International Stevedoring Co. v. Haverty, \n272 \nU.S. 50\n, 47 S. Ct. 19, and that by that act Congress had occupied the field and excluded all state legislation having application within it, I am content to rest this case on that ground. See Nogueira v. N. Y., N.

But I do not agree that the present case is so exclusively controlled by the maritime law that workmen otherwise in the situation of respondent, but who are not seamen and therefore not given a remedy by the Jones Act, and who are not within the purview of the Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65 (45 USCA  51), are excluded from the benefits of a compensation act like that of Texas.

S.(1930)\nNo. 25\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 38, 39]\n\u00a0\n Mr. D. A. Kelsey, of Norfolk, Va., pro hac vice, by special leave of court.\n Mr. Jacob L. Morewitz, of Newport News, Va., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Providence, R. I., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case depends upon the construction and effect of section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920,1 which amended section 20 of the Seamen's Act of 19152 so as to provide:\n'That any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply; and in case of the death of any seaman as a result of any such personal injury the personal repre- \n\n[281 U.S. 38, 40]\n\u00a0\n sentative of such seaman may maintain an action for damages at law with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees shall be applicable. ...'\n\n By this Act, as heretofore construed by this Court, the prior maritime law of the United States was modified by giving to seamen injured through negligence the rights given to railway employees by the Federal Employers' Liability Act and its amendments, and permitting these new and substantive rights to be asserted and enforced in actions in personam against the employers in federal and state courts administering common law remedies, or in suits in admiralty in courts administering maritime remedies.

Ct. 75.\n The Federal Employers' Liability Act,3 which was incorporated in the Merchant Marine Act by reference, related to the liability of common carriers by railroad to their employees in interstate and other commerce, as specified. Section 1 provided that every such carrier 'shall be liable in damages' to any employee suffering injury, 'or, in case of the death of such employee, to his or her personal representative, for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children of such employee; and, if none, then of such employee's parents; and, if none, then of the next of kin dependent upon such employee, for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier, or by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, works, boats, wharves, or other equipment.' By \n\n[281 U.S. 38, 41]\n\u00a0\n this section if the injury to the employee results in death his personal representative-while not given any right of action in behalf of the estate- is invested, solely as trustee for the designated survivors, with the right to recover for their benefit such damages as will compensate them for any pecuniary loss which they sustained by the death. See St. Louis, Iron M. & S. Ry. Co. v. Craft, \n237 \nU.S. 648, 656\n, 35 S. Ct. 704; C., B. & Q. R. Co. v. Wells-Dickey Co., \n275 \nU.S. 161, 163\n, 48 S. Ct. 73, 59 A. L. R. 758. And if the employee leaves no survivors in any of the classes of beneficiaries alternatively designated, it necessarily follows that the personal representative cannot maintain any action to recover damages for the death, since there is no beneficiary in whose behalf such an action can be brought.\n In 1926, Barford, a seaman employed as third mate on a merchant vessel owned by the United States-then lying at the port of Norfolk, Virginia, in a floating drydock of Colonna's Shipyard, Inc., in which it was being reconditioned-while working in a lifeboat swinging on the vessel's davits, was thrown on the dock by the sudden release of one end of the lifeboat and instantly killed. Lindgren, the administrator of his estate, proceeding under the Suits in Admiralty Act,4 filed a libel in personam against the United States in the Federal District Court for Eastern Virginia to recover damages for his death. 5 The libel declared specifically 'in a cause of tort and death by wrongful act;' alleged that Barford's death was occasioned by negligence and wrongdoing on the part of the United States, its officers, servants and employees in respect to the fastening of the lifeboat and various other matters; and averred that the libellant, as administrator of Bar- \n\n[281 U.S. 38, 42]\n\u00a0\n ford's estate, was entitled to recover, 'for and on behalf of the decedent's dependents and heirs,' damages for his death. It did not allege, however, that Barford left surviving him either a widow, child or parent, or any next of kin dependent upon him; nor that his death was caused by unseaworthiness of the vessel.\n The United States unsuccessfully excepted to the libel on the ground that it 'failed to state a cause of action,' and then answered on the merits, averring inter alia, that in any event it would not be liable to damages in excess of the proved dependency of such dependents as Barford might have left surviving him.\n At the hearing it was not shown that Barford left any survivor in any of the classes designated as beneficiaries by the Federal Employers' Liability Act; there being no evidence that his heirs, a nephew and niece, where dependent upon him.\n The District Court found that Barford's death was caused by the negligent installation of the releasing gear in the lifeboat, which permitted it to fall and made this device unseaworthy; held that, although the administrator could not recover under the Merchant Marine Act, applying the rule under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, since the surviving nephew and niece were not dependent, he was entitled to recover under the Virginia Death Statute,6 which provided that a personal representative might maintain a suit for damages on account of the death of a person caused by the wrongful act of another-under which dependency was not a necessary condition and the probable earnings of the decedent might be shown; and fixed the damages under this statute at $5,000, for which the administrator was given a decree against the United States.\n On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the right of action given to the personal representative of a \n\n[281 U.S. 38, 43]\n\u00a0\n seaman by the Merchant Marine Act for personal injury resulting in death, was exclusive and superseded the Virginia Death Statute; and since, under the provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act incorporated in the Merchant Marine Act, there could be no recovery, reversed the decree of the District Court and dismissed the libel. 28 F.(2d) 725.\n It is clear that, as Barford left no survivors designated as beneficiaries by the Federal Employers' Liability Act, the administrator was not entitled to maintain an action for the recovery of damages under the provisions of that Act, made applicable in case of the death of a seaman by section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act. But while this is not questioned by the administrator, he urges that the right of action given the personal representative by the Merchant Marine Act is not exclusive, and that it neither supersedes the right of action given him by the death statute of the State in which the injury was sustained, nor precludes his right to recover indemnity for the death under the old admiralty rules on the ground that the injuries were occasioned by the unseaworthiness of the vessel. These contentions cannot be sustained.\n\n 1. \nPrior to the adoption of the Merchant Marine Act the general maritime law of the United States did not authorize any recovery of damages or indemnity for the death of a seaman, whether the injury was caused by the negligence of the owner or other members of the crew or the unseaworthiness of the vessel. See The Harrisburg, \n119 \nU.S. 199\n, 7 S. Ct. 140; The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158, 175\n, 23 S. Ct. 483, 47 S. Ct. 760; Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, \n257 \nU.S. 233, 240\n, 42 S. Ct. 89. In this situation it was held, in the absence of any legislation by Congress, that where a seaman's death resulted from a maritime tort on navigable waters within a State whose statutes gave a right of action on account of death by wrongful act, the admiralty courts could entertain a libel in personam for the damages sustained by those to whom such right \n\n[281 U.S. 38, 44]\n\u00a0\n was given. Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, supra, \n257 \nU.S. 242\n, 42 S. Ct. 89; Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Kierejewski, \n261 \nU.S. 479, 480\n, 43 S. Ct. 418.7 But, as said by the Circuit Court of Appeals, such statutes 'were not a part of the general maritime law' and were recognized only because Congress had not legislated on the subject.\n By the Merchant Marine Act, however, the prior maritime law was modified by giving to personal representatives of seamen whose death had resulted from personal injuries, the right to maintain an action for damages in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act. It is plain that the Merchant Marine Act is one of general application intended to bring about the uniformity in the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction required by the Constitution, and necessarily supersedes the application of the death statutes of the several States. This has been determined in two prior decisions of this Court. In Panama Railroad Co. v. Johnson, supra, 392 of 264 U. S., 44 S. Ct. 391, 396,-the pioneer case in which the constitutionality and effect of section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act was considered and dealt with at length-in answering the assertion that the Act departed from the constitutional requirement that it should be coextensive with and operate uniformly in the whole of the United States, the Court said: 'The statute extends territorially as far as Congress can make it go, and there is nothing in it to cause its operation to be otherwise than uniform. The national legislation respecting injuries to railway employees engaged in interstate and foreign commerce which it adopts has a uniform operation, and neither is nor can be deflected therefrom by local statutes or local views of common law rules. Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 51\n, 55 S., 32 S. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44; Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Baugh, \n149 \nU.S. 368, 378\n, 13 S. Ct. 914. Of course that legislation will have a like operation as part of this \n\n[281 U.S. 38, 45]\n\u00a0\n statute.' And recently we said in Northern Coal Co. v. Strand, \n278 \nU.S. 142, 147\n, 49 S. Ct. 88, 90: 'We think it necessarily follows from former decisions that by the Merchant Marine Act-a measure of general application-Congress provided a method under which the widow of (a seaman) might secure damages resulting from his death, and that no state statute can provide any other or different one.' To the same effect is Patrone v. Howlett, 237 N. Y. 394, 397, 143 N. E. 232, 233, in which the court said that the administrators of a seaman killed in the course of his employment, 'did not have a remedy under the state act after the (Merchant Marine) Act occupied the field and became a part of the general maritime law.'\n These decisions are in accordance with the long settled rule that since Congress by the Federal Employers' Liability Act took possession of the field of the employers' liability to employees in interstate transportation by rail, all state laws on the subject are superseded. Second Employers' Liability Cases, supra, 54 of 223 U. S., 32 S. Ct. 169; Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 501\n, 34 S. Ct. 635, L. R. A. 1915C, 1, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475; New York Central R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 \nU.S. 147, 149\n, 37 S. Ct. 546, L. R. A. 1918C, 439, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 1139; Erie R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 \nU.S. 170, 172\n, 37 S. Ct. 556, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 662; and cases cited. In the Second Employers' Liability Cases, supra, 54 of 223 U. S., 32 S. Ct. 169, 177, this Court said: 'True, prior to the present act, the laws of the several states were regarded as determinative of the liability of employers engaged in interstate commerce for injuries received by their employees while engaged in such commerce. But that was because Congress, although empowered to regulate that subject, had not acted thereon, and because the subject is one which falls within the police power of the states in the absence of action by Congress. Sherlock v. Alling, \n93 U.S. 99\n; Smith v. Alabama, \n124 \nU.S. 465, 473\n, 480 S., 482, 8 S. Ct. 564, 510, 513, 514; Nashville, &c. Railway v. Alabama, \n128 \nU.S. 96, 99\n, 9 S. Ct. 28, 353; Reid v. Colorado, \n187 \nU.S. 137, 146\n, 23 S. Ct. 92, 113. The inaction of Congress, however, in no wise affected its power over \n\n[281 U.S. 38, 46]\n\u00a0\n the subject. The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 581, 664; Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 \nU.S. 196, 215\n, 5 S. Ct. 826, 166. And now that Congress has acted, the laws of the states, in so far as they cover the same field, are superseded, for necessarily that which is not supreme must yield to that which is. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. Hefley, \n158 \nU.S. 98, 104\n, 15 S. Ct. 802, 912; Southern Railway Co. v. Reid, \n222 \nU.S. 424\n, 32 S. Ct. 140; Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Washington, \n222 \nU.S. 370\n, 32 S. Ct. 160.'\n In New York Central R. R. Co. v. Winfield, supra, 150, 153 of 244 U. S., 37 S. Ct. 546, the Court furthermore held that although the Federal Employers' Liability Act 'does not require the carrier to respond for injuries occurring where it is not chargeable with negligence,' this is 'because Congress, in its discretion, acted upon the principle that compensation should be exacted from the carrier where, and only where, the injury results from negligence imputable to it'; that the Act 'is as comprehensive of injuries occurring without negligence, as to which class it impliedly excludes liability, as it is of those as to which it imposes liability' and 'is a regulation of the carriers' duty or obligation as to both'; and that 'the reasons which operate to prevent the States from dispensing with compensation where the act requires it equally prevent them from requiring compensation where the act withholds or excludes it.' This was followed and approved in Erie R. R. Co. v. Winfield, supra, 172 of 244 U. S., 37 S. Ct. 556, 557, in which the Court said that the Act 'establishes a rule or regulation which is intended to operate uniformly in all the states, as respects interstate commerce, and in that field it is both paramount and exclusive.'\n In the light of the foregoing decisions and in accordance with the principles therein announced we conclude that the Merchant Marine Act- adopted by Congress in the exercise of its paramount authority in reference to the maritime law and incorporating in that law the provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act-establishes as \n\n[281 U.S. 38, 47]\n\u00a0\n a modification of the prior maritime law a rule of general application in reference to the liability of the owners of vessels for injuries to seamen extending territorially as far as Congress can make it go; that this operates uniformly within all of the States and is as comprehensive of those instances in which by reference to the Federal Employers' Liability Act it excludes liability, as of those in which liability is imposed; and that, as it covers the entire field of liability for injuries to seamen, it is paramount and exclusive, and supersedes the operation of all state statutes dealing with that subject.\n It results that in the present case no resort can be had to the Virginia Death Statute, either to create a right of action not given by the Merchant Marine Act, or to establish a measure of damages not provided by that Act.\n\n 2. \nNor can the libel be sustained as one to recover indemnity for Barford's death under the old maritime rules on the ground that the injuries were occasioned by the unseaworthiness of the vessel. Aside from the fact that the libel does not allege the unseaworthiness of the vessel and is based upon negligence alone, an insuperable objection to this suggestion is that the prior maritime law, as hereinabove stated, gave no right to recover indemnity for the death of a seaman, although occasioned by unseaworthiness of the vessel. The statement in The Osceola, supra, 175 of 189 U. S., 23 S. Ct. 483, on which the administrator relies, relates only to the seaman's own right to recover for personal injuries occasioned by unseaworthiness of the vessel, and confers no right whatever upon his personal representatives to recover indemnity for his death. Apparently for this reason the words 'at his election'-which appear in the first clause of section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act, relating to the personal right of action of an injured seaman, and, as held in Pacific S. S. Co. v. Peterson, supra, 139 of 278 U. S., 49 S. Ct. 75, 78, gave him, as alternative measures of relief, 'an election are merely the right under the new rule to recover compensatory damages for injuries caused by negligence and \n\n[281 U.S. 38, 48]\n\u00a0\n the right under the old rules to recover indemnity for injuries occasioned by unseaworthiness'-were omitted from the second clause of section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act, relating to the right of the personal representative to recover damages for the seaman's death, since there was no right to indemnity under the prior maritime law which he might have elected to pursue. And, for the reasons already stated, and in the absence of any right of election, the right of action given the personal representative by the second clause of section 33 to recover damages for the seaman's death when caused by negligence, for and on behalf of designated beneficiaries, is necessarily exclusive and precludes the right of recovery of indemnity for his death by reason of unseaworthiness of the vessel, irrespective of negligence, which cannot be eked out by resort to the death statute of the State in which the injury was received.\n\n 3. \nIt is suggested in argument that if the statutes of the several States are superseded by the Merchant Marine Act it would follow that the Death on the High Seas Act,8 which had been previously adopted, would likewise be superseded. That Act, however, concededly has no application here, since Barford's death did not occur on the high seas but within the territorial limits of the State of Virginia. We have no occasion to consider its scope and effect here and do not determine what effect, if any, the Merchant Marine Act has upon it; and nothing stated in this opinion is to be considered as having any reference to those questions. Nor do we consider or determine the effect of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act,9 upon which, although incidentally referred to in argument, neither the administrator nor the United States here relies.\n The decree is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 41 Stat. 988, c. 250; U.

Hebner, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n When the income tax return for 1919, of the American Code Company, Inc., was being audited in 1925, the company filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue a claim for a refund based upon its failure to deduct from its 1919 gross income the amount for which judgment was recovered against it in 1922, on a contested liability for a breach of contract in 1919. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue rejected the claim and asserted a deficiency. His ruling was sustained by the Board of Tax Appeals. American Code Co., Inc., v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 10 B. T. A. 476. Its decision was reversed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 30 F. (2d) 222, 224. We granted a writ of certiorari. \n279 \nU.S. 832\n, 49 S. Ct. 481.\n The facts on which the claim for the refund is based are as follows: The company agreed to employ Farquhar as sales manager for 18 years from January 3, 1919, the compensation to be a commission based on sales. In May, 1919, it discharged him, for alleged cause. In July, 1919, Farquhar brought suit against it in the Supreme Court of New York for wrongful discharge, claiming $100,000 damages. Affirmative defenses were interposed, and liability was contested. In October, 1919, the company notified the Commissioner of the suit and asked leave to deduct in its income tax return an amount equal to the commissions for 1919 computed on the contract basis. Permission was refused; but the company set up on its books, at the close of the year, a reserve equal to \n\n[280 U.S. 445, 448]\n\u00a0\n the amount of such commissions, $14,764.79. At the close of 1920, the amount in this reserve was increased by $32,994.09, computed on the same basis. In 1922, after a jury trial, judgment for $21,019.19 was entered in the trial court, and, on appeal by the company, was affirmed by the Appellate Division. The company then prosecuted a further appeal to the Court of Appeals. In 1923 the judgment was affirmed by that court and paid by the company. The judgment having been rendered by the trial court early in 1922 before the books were closed for 1921, the reserve set up was adjusted as of the close of 1921 to the amount of the recovery, $21,019.19. That sum is claimed as the deduction for 1919\n\n\n The company kept its books and made its income tax returns on the accrual basis. The Revenue Act of 1918, Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18,  234(a), (4), 40 Stat. 1057, 1077, 1078, provides that in computing net income 'losses sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise' shall be allowed as deductions. Section 212(b) provides that the net income shall be computed 'in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of such taxpayer,' unless the method employed does not clearly reflect the net income. And Article 111 of regulations No. 45 (1920 Ed.) of the Bureau of Internal Revenue provides that a 'person making returns on an accrual basis has the right to deduct all authorized allowances, whether paid in cash or set up as a liability. ...'\n The company's argument, sustained by the Court of Appeals, is that, since the breach of the contract occurred in 1919, all the facts which gave rise to the liability were fixed in that year; that damages must be assessed as of the date of the breach; that the loss therefore occurred in that year; and that it is immaterial that the amount of the damages was not determined or paid until later. \n\n[280 U.S. 445, 449]\n\u00a0\n Attention is specifically called to the provision in article 111, which declares that, if after making a return 'a taxpayer first ascertains the amount of a loss sustained during a prior taxable year which has not been deducted from gross income, he may render an amended return for such preceding taxable year, including such amount of loss in the deductions from gross income, and may file a claim for refund of the excess tax paid by reason of the failure to deduct such loss in the original return.'\n Generally speaking, the income tax law is concerned only with realized losses, as with realized gains. Weiss v. Wiener, \n279 \nU.S. 333, 335\n, 49 S. Ct. 337. Exception is made, however, in the case of losses which are so reasonably certain in fact and ascertainable in amount as to justify their deduction, in certain circumstances, before they are absolutely realized. As respects losses occasioned by the taxpayer's breach of contract, no definite legal test is provided by the statute for the determination of the year in which the loss is to be deducted. The general requirement that losses be deducted in the year in which they are sustained calls for a practical, not a legal, test. And the direction that net income be computed according to the method of accounting regularly employed by the taxpayer is expressly limited to cases where the Commissioner believes that the accounts clearly reflect the net income. Much latitude for discretion is thus given to the administrative board charged with the duty of enforcing the act. Its interpretation of the statute and the practice adopted by it should not be interfered with unless clearly unlawful.\n Article 111 of regulations No. 45, interpreting the provisions as to deductions for losses, states: 'Any amount paid pursuant to a judgment or otherwise on account of damages for personal injuries, patent infringement or otherwise, is deductible from gross income when the claim is put in judgment or paid. ...' The \n\n[280 U.S. 445, 450]\n\u00a0\n Board of Tax Appeals has held, in a series of well-reasoned opinions, that a loss occasioned by the taxpayer's breach of contract is not deductible in the year of the breach, except under the special circumstances where, within the tax year, there is a definite admission of liability, negotiations for settlement are begun, and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the loss is accrued on the books. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n It may be assumed that, since the company kept its books on the accrual basis, the mere fact that the exact amount of the liability had not been definitely fixed in 1919 would not prevent the deduction, as a loss of that year, of the amount later paid. But here there are other obstacles. Obviously, the mere refusal to perform a contract does not justify the deduction, as a loss, of the anticipated damages. For, even an unquestionable breach does not result in loss, if the injured party forgives or refrains from prosecuting his claim. And, when liability is contested, the institution of a suit does not, of itself, create certainty of loss. In the few cases in which the \n\n[280 U.S. 445, 451]\n\u00a0\n Board of Tax Appeals has allowed a deduction in the year of the breach, the contracts, involving the purchase and sale of goods, were performable in a comparatively short period; the approximate amount of the damages was reasonably predictable; negotiations for settlement had been commenced within the year and were completed soon after its close; and the taxpayers had accrued on their books, at the end of the year, a liability reasonably estimated to equal the amount of the damages. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n In the case at bar, the contract had nearly 18 more years to run, at the time of its breach. Liability for the breach was denied and strenuously contested, the litigation being carried to the highest court of the state. The amount of the damages, if any, was wholly unpredictable. While the facts determining liability had occurred in the year of the breach, the amount to be recovered, if there was legal liability, depended in large part on the course of future events. Farquhar was under a duty to mitigate damages. He might have procured new employment which would have reduced his recovery to a nominal amount. Or, recovery might have been reduced or defeated by his death. Finally, the company did not accrue on its books, within the tax year, a liability in the estimated amount of the loss. The reserve set up had no relation to the apprehended total loss. It constituted simply the amount of the commissions which would have \n\n[280 U.S. 445, 452]\n\u00a0\n been payable in that year, if Farquhar had remained in the company's employ. That the company did not intend the reserve to be an accrual of the total estimated loss is clearly indicated by the fact that, in 1920, it charged to the reserve, to cover the commissions which would have been payable in 1920, an additional amount, more than double that charged in 1919.\n The prudent business man often sets up reserves to cover contingent liabilities. But they are not allowable as deductions. \n3\n The reserve set up by the company was of that character. It cannot be said that the loss actually paid by the company in 1923 was, as a matter of law or of undeniable fact, sustained in 1919. Nor did the company so regard it. The case at bar is unlike United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422\n, 46 S. Ct. 131. There, the liability for the munitions tax at a fixed rate on the business done in 1916 had confessedly accrued in that year and was a charge on the business of that year, although the exact amount due may not have been then ascertainable and the tax was not payable until 1917. It is also unlike American National Co. v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 99\n, 47 S. Ct. 520. There, the bonus contract provided definitely for the payment of a fixed amount. It was debitum in praesenti, solvendum in futuro. The case at bar is in principle more like Lewellyn v. Electric Reduction Co., \n275 \nU.S. 243\n, 48 S.

C., for petitioner.\n Warren Olney, Jr., of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent.[ Lucas v. Earl \n281 U.S. 111\n (1930) ]\n\n\n[281 U.S. 111, 113]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question whether the respondent, Earl, could be taxed for the whole of the salary and attorney's fees earned by him in the years 1920 and 1921, or should be taxed for only a half of them in view of a contract with his wife which we shall mention. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Board of Tax Appeals imposed a tax upon the whole, but their decision was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 30 F.(2d) 898. A writ of certiorari was granted by this court.\n By the contract, made in 1901, Earl and his wife agreed 'that any property either of us now has or may hereafter \n\n[281 U.S. 111, 114]\n\u00a0\n acquire ... in any way, either by earnings (including salaries, fees, etc.), or any rights by contract or otherwise, during the existence of our marriage, or which we or either of us may receive by gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance, and all the proceeds, issues, and profits of any and all such property shall be treated and considered, and hereby is declared to be received, held, taken, and owned by us as joint tenants, and not otherwise, with the right of survivorship.' The validity of the contract is not questioned, and we assume it to be unquestionable under the law of the State of California, in which the parties lived. Nevertheless we are of opinion that the Commissioner and Board of Tax Appeals were right.\n The Revenue Act of 1918 approved February 24, 1919, c. 18,  210, 211, 212(a), 213(a), 40 Stat. 1057, 1062, 1064, 1065, imposes a tax upon the net income of every individual including 'income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service ... of whatever kind and in whatever form paid,'  213(a). The provisions of the Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 233, 237, 238, in sections bearing the same numbers are similar to those of the above. A very forcible argument is presented to the effect that the statute seeks to tax only income beneficially received, and that taking the question more technically the salary and fees became the joint property of Earl and his wife on the very first instant on which they were received. We well might hesitate upon the latter proposition, because however the matter might stand between husband and wife he was the only party to the contracts by which the salary and fees were earned, and it is somewhat hard to say that the last step in the performance of those contracts could be taken by anyone but himself alone. But this case is not to be decided by attenuated subtleties. It turns on the import and reasonable construction of the taxing act. There is no doubt that the statute could tax salaries to those who earned them and \n\n[281 U.S. 111, 115]\n\u00a0\n provide that the tax could not be escaped by anticipatory arrangements and contracts however skilfully devised to prevent the salary when paid from vesting even for a second in the man who earned it. That seems to us the import of the statute before us and we think that no distinction can be taken according to the motives leading to the arrangement by which the fruits are attributed to a different tree from that on which they grew.\n Judgment reversed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in this case. \n\n\n\n","78":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLUCAS v. KANSAS CITY STRUCTURAL STEEL CO.(1930)\nNo. 323\nArgued: Decided: April 14, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 264, 265]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Charles E. Hughes, Jr., Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Armwell L. Cooper, of Kansas City, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Kansas City Structural Steel Company, a Missouri concern, appealed to the United States Board of Tax Appeals from determinations by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue which made an increase of $7,656.74 in \n\n[281 U.S. 264, 266]\n\u00a0\n the company's 1918 income tax and of $15,953.36 in its 1920 income tax. \n1\n These additions were due wholly to changes made by the Commissioner in the inventory valuation of material carried in stock. The company valued at a constant price all the material which did not exceed in quantity what was said to be the normal stock on hand. \n2\n The Commissioner revalued this at current market prices. The changes resulted in increasing the December, 1918, inventory by $165,849.46 and the December 31, 1920, inventory by $ 117,113.61. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner's action. 11 B. T. A. 877. Its decision was reversed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 33 F.(2d) 53. This Court granted writs of certiorari, Lucas v. Kansas City Structural Steel Co., \n280 \nU.S. 543\n, 50 S. Ct. 36, 74 L. Ed. -.\n Section 203 of the Revenue Act of 1918, Feb. 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1060, provides: 'That whenever in the opinion of the Commissioner the use of inventories is necessary in order clearly to determine the income of any taxpayer, inventories shall be taken by such taxpayer upon such basis as the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary, may prescribe as conforming as nearly as may be to the best accounting practice in the trade or business and as most clearly reflecting the income.' \n3\n Regulations 45 (1920 edition, as amended by Treasury \n\n[281 U.S. 264, 267]\n\u00a0\n Decision 3296) provides, in Article 1581, that 'inventories at the beginning and end of each year are necessary in every case in which the production, purchase, or sale of merchandise is an income-producing factor.' Article 1582 declares that the basis of valuation 'most commonly used by business concerns and which meets the requirements of the revenue act is ( a) cost or (b) cost or market, whichever is lower'; that 'goods taken in the inventory which have been so intermingled that they cannot be identified with specific invoices will be deemed to be ... the goods most recently purchased'; that the 'taxpayer must satisfy the commissioner of the correctness of the prices adopted'; and that '(d) using a constant price or nominal value for a so-called normal quantity of materials or goods in stock' is not in accord with the regulations. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The company is engaged in the fabrication and erection of steel plates for buildings, bridges, tanks, etc. It does not carry finished products in stock, but fabricates the plates for specific structures or contracts. It orders material from the mills for each structure or contract; but it also keeps a supply on hand in order 'to insure the prompt and orderly execution of contracts in view of delay, etc., incident to shipments from the mills and other exigencies affecting the availability for use when needed of material ordered for a particular job.' Material is taken from this supply as and when needed; and the stock is subsequently replenished. \n5\n On December 31, \n\n[281 U.S. 264, 268]\n\u00a0\n 1916, the quantity in stock was 5,554 tons. The company then inventoried it at cost-$1.70 per hundredweight f. o. b. Pittsburgh. At the close of each year thereafter, until 1921, the company inventoried its stock on hand up to 5,554 tons at that price regardless of its actual cost or the market, and the excess, if any, at cost or market price, whichever was lower. In the tax years in question, the market was much higher. It is not shown what the actual cost of the stock then on hand was, or that any of it had cost, as little as $1.70. 6 The Commissioner therefore revalued the entire stock at market price, with the consequent increase in the taxes complained of.\n First. Whether in a particular business inventories are necessary for the determination of income is a practical question left by the statute to the judgment of the Commissioner. On that question, he and the company did not differ. In every year, it, without any question or protest, used inventories in making its return. The dispute was merely on the method of valuation to be adopted for that part of the stock which it calls its normal stock. Throughout, the company valued at cost or market prices all stock in excess of 5,554 tons; and since 1921 has so valued all the stock on hand.\n It is not contested that, if inventories are necessary in order to determine the company's income, the 'base stock' method does not fulfill the desiderata. The federal income tax system is based upon an annual accounting period. This requires that gains or losses be accounted for in the year in which they are realized. The purpose of the inventories is to assign to each period its profits and losses. In years of rising prices, the 'base stock' \n\n[281 U.S. 264, 269]\n\u00a0\n method causes an understatement of income; for it disregards the gains actually realized through liquidation of low price stock on a high price market. In times of falling prices, it causes an overstatement of income; for it ignores the losses which result from the consumption of high price stock. This method may, like many reserves which business men set up on their books for their own purposes, serve to equalize the results of operations during a series of years. But it is inconsistent with the annual accounting required by Congress for income tax purposes. It results in offsetting an inventory gain of one year against an inventory loss of another, obscures the true gain or loss of the tax year, and thus misrepresents the facts. It does not conform with the general or best accounting methods and is apparently obsolete. \n7\n The company disclaims any defense of the base stock method; and the lower court disapproved it.\n Second. It is urged, however, that the inventory requirement is not applicable to the company's stock to the extent of 5,554 tons; that the company is not a dealer, manufacturer, or producer, but rather a contractor or builder; that its income results from the performance of its construction contracts; that the material in its standby stock has no relation to these contracts, the contract prices, or the company's profits; that the material from this stock is only borrowed for specific jobs and is promptly replaced in kind; that it is not an income pro- \n\n[281 U.S. 264, 270]\n\u00a0\n ducing factor, but is like the company's machinery and equipment; and that any accretion to the value of this material is of no consequence until a final liquidation. The contentions are inconsistent with the company's practice and are unsound.\n The company's purchase and production of steel plates is obviously an income producing factor. Throughout the years, the company has varying amounts of material on hand. The value of the particular material used, at the time of use, plainly affects its profits. That the material is replaced in kind and its amount kept within some limits is not exceptional and is of no significance. Most concerns strive ordinarily to carry no more stock than is required for the safe and profitable conduct of the business. They plan neither to run short nor to overstock. They replace supplies as they are cousumed. And the cost or value of the new material is properly reflected in the later inventories and returns. There is nothing peculiar about the 5,554 tons, except that that happened to be the amount of stock on hand on December 31, 1916. It is not a permanent stock, like machinery or equipment. Nor is it merely depleted by borrowing and promptly restored to that fixed size. On the contrary, the stock has fluctuated from about 3,000 tons in 1918 to 11,000 tons in 1920.8 There is no stand- \n\n[281 U.S. 264, 271]\n\u00a0\n by stock set aside and earmarked as such. The material is all comingled and is indiscriminately used in production, as and when needed. No reason is given for excepting 5,554 tons-no more and no less. To draw an artificial line at that amount would distort the computation of income in the accounting periods, although the errors might be equalized in a series of years. Since inventories are properly deemed necessary, the exception of that or any amount is nothing but the use of the discarded 'base stock' method.\n The company's case falls far short of meeting the heavy burden of proving that the Commissioner's action was plainly arbitrary. Compare Lucas v. American Code Co., \n280 \nU.S. 445, 449\n, 50 S. Ct. 202; Williamsport Wire Rope Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 551, 559\n, 48 S.

No. 323 involves the tax for 1918; No. 324, that for 1920. Except for the years and the amounts the facts in the two cases are identical. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The system followed, if intended as a method of inventory, is known to accounting as the 'base stock,' 'minimum' or 'cushion' method. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] This provision was incorporated in every Revenue Act since 1918. 1921, c. 136,  203, 42 Stat. 227, 231; 1924, c. 234,  205, 43 Stat. 253, 260 (26 USCA  936); 1920, c. 27,  205, 44 Stat. 9, 16 (26 USCA  936); 1928, c. 852,  22(c), 45 Stat. 791, 799 (26 USCA  2022(c). Although no similar provision was made in earlier acts, regulations of the Department supplied it. Internal Revenue Bureau, Regulations 31, arts. 2(3) & (4); Regulations 33, art. 161; Regulations 33 (Revised), arts. 91, 92, 120. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The provision relative to the valuation of inventories at a constant price was, in effect, a restatement of a Treasury ruling promulgated in September, 1919, as Advisory Tax Board Ruling No. 65, T. B. R. 65, C. B. 1, 51. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] The stipulated facts recite: 'When such material is used it is charged to the contract at its replacement cost and is promptly replaced with material of a like kind and in a like quantity.' The phrase 'charged to the contract' evidently means that it is so charged in those accounts on the company's books which are designed to guide it in determining the cost of a particular job. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] In September, 1917, the government fixed the price of structural shapes, f. o. b. Pittsburg at $3 per hundredweight and of tank plates at $ 3.25. After relinquishment of government control, the prices fell. Those in 1920 were for structural steel $2.45, for tank plates $2.65. In 1921 the prices fell to $1.50. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In a well reasoned report, the Advisory Tax Board, in 1919, ruled that the 'base stock' 'minimum' or 'cushion' method did not withstand 'the changing tests of time' and could not be approved. Since then, all Regulations of the Department expressly prohibited its use. See Regulations 45, art. 1582; Regulations 62, art. 1582; Regulations 65, art. 1612; Regulations 69, art. 1612; Regulations 74, art. 102.

C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Albert B. Hall and Joseph J. Eckford, both of Dallas, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent, a Texas corporation, for some time prior to 1917 was engaged in operating a sawmill, selling lumber and buying and selling timber lands. December 27, 1916, it gave to the Southern Pine Company a ten-day option to purchase its timber lands for a specified price. The latter was solvent and able to make the purchase. On the same day title was examined and found satisfactory to the Pine Company. It arranged for the money needed, and December 30, 1916, notified respondent that it would exercise the option, On that day respondent ceased operations and withdrew all employees from the land. January 5, 1917, the papers which were required to effect the transfer were delivered, the purchase price was paid, and the transaction was finally closed. \n\n[281 U.S. 11, 13]\n\u00a0\n Respondent kept its accounts on the accrual basis, and treated the profits derived from the sale as income in 1916. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that the gain had been realized in, and was taxable for, 1917. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained his finding. 7 B. T. A. 1193. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board. 30 F.(2d) 680.\n The gain derived from this sale was taxable income. \n1\n If attributed to 1916, the tax would be much less than if made in 1917.2 Section 13(d) of the Revenue Act of 1916 provided that a corporation keeping its accounts upon any basis other than that of actual receipts and disbursements, unless such other basis failed clearly to reflect income, might make return upon the basis upon which its accounts were kept and have the tax computed upon the income so returned. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n An executory contract of sale was created by the option and notice, December 30, 1916. In the notice, the purchaser declared itself ready to close the transaction and pay the purchase price 'as soon as the papers were prepared.' Respondent did not prepare the papers necessary to effect the transfer or make tender of title or possession or demand the purchase price in 1916. The title and right of possession remained in it until the transaction was closed. Consequently unconditional liability of vendee for the purchase price was not created in that year. Gober v.

Gen ., for petitioner.\n Mr. Harry B. Sutter, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Ox Fibre Brush Company appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals from the determination by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue of a deficiency in the income tax of the corporation for the year 1920. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the ruling of the Commissioner (8 B. T. A. 422), and this decision was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 32 F.(2d) 42.\n The question relates to extra compensation granted by the directors of the corporation in the year 1920 to the president and treasurer, of $24, 000 each. In the income tax return for that year, the corporation deducted these items from the gross income and the Commissioner of \n\n[281 U.S. 115, 117]\n\u00a0\n Internal Revenue disallowed the deduction. The Board of Tax Appeals held that, if the additional compensation was given for services performed in prior years, it was not deductible in the year 1920; and if, as the Board concluded, it was allowed for services rendered in 1920, it was in excess of reasonable compensation for that year and hence could not be deducted.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals found that the conclusion of the Board of Tax Appeals that the additional compensation was allowed for services performed in the year 1920 was without evidence to support it; that the compensation was for past services. It was further decided that the amount of the additional payment was reasonable in the circumstances shown and was deductible in the return for 1920, the year in which it was allowed and paid.\n From the facts as found by the Circuit Court of Appeals, it appears that the president of the corporation had been in office from 1906 and its treasurer from 1907. Both of these officers had devoted their entire time to the interests of the corporation. Each year they had personally guaranteed bank loans to the corporation of considerable amounts. In addition to their ordinary executive duties, the president and treasurer had charge of all large purchases, of all sales, and had directed the general policies of the corporation. Prior to their administration, the business of the corporation had been in a chaotic state and had been conducted at a loss, but under their management the gross sales had increased from about $374,000 in 1909 to $1,273,000 in 1920. The net results were changed from an operating loss of about $4,000 in 1908 to net earnings (after deduction of salaries, including the amounts here in question) of about $158,000 in 1920. No dividends were paid until 1910, but dividends were increased from $4,500 in 1911 and 1912 to $423.275 in \n\n[281 U.S. 115, 118]\n\u00a0\n 1920, represented by a fifty per cent. stock dividend of $300,000 and cash dividends aggregating $123,275, or 25.98 per cent. on the outstanding capitalization at the beginning of that year. The net income in 1920, after a deduction of all expenses, including officers' salaries, represented a return of 21.13 per cent. on invested capital of about $750, 000, as determined by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The corporation had advanced to a leading place in the brush trade. In 1919 and 1920, the president and treasurer had received salaries of $12,000 and $ 15,000, respectively. In 1918 their combined salaries were approximately $ 25,000. The record does not disclose what they received in 1915, 1916 and 1917, but in 1914 they together received $16,000; in 1913, $11,000; in the three preceding years, $10,000; and before that time they received $6,000.\n On May 6, 1920, the board of directors unanimously voted to pay to each of these officers $24,000, the resolution in each case explicitly stating that it was paid 'as extra compensation for his past services to this company as an officer thereof and in any other capacity.'\n The books of the corporation were kept on an accrual basis, and during May, 1920, proper entry was made crediting the accounts of the president and treasurer with the additional compensation thus voted.\n It is unnecessary to review the facts more in detail, as the Government, adopting the view that the additional compensation, as stated in the resolution of the board of directors and as found by the Circuit Court of Appeals, was for services performed in prior years, concedes on behalf of the Commissioner that the payments were reasonable for such services. The sole question, therefore, which the Government presents is whether these payments were properly deductible in the return for the year 1920. \n\n[281 U.S. 115, 119]\n\u00a0\n The statute applicable to the return is the Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057. Section 234(a) of that act provides (Id. p. 1077):\n'Sec. 234. (a) That in computing the net income of a corporation subject to the tax imposed by section 230 there shall be allowed as deductions:\n\n'(1) All the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business, including a reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered. ...'\n\n The payments in the present instance were actually made in the year 1920. The expenses represented by these payments were incurred in that year, for it is undisputed that there was no prior agreement or legal obligation to pay the additional compensation. This compensation for past services, it being admitted that it was reasonable in amount in view of the large benefits which the corporation had received as the fruits of these services, the corporation had a right to pay, if it saw fit. There is no suggestion of attempted evasion or abuse. The payments were made as a matter of internal policy having appropriate regard to the advantage of recognition of skill and fidelity as a stimulus to continued effort. There was nothing in the income tax law to preclude such action. On the contrary, the payments fell directly within the provision of section 234(a) as a reasonable allowance for compensation for personal services actually rendered. The statute does not require that the services should be actually rendered during the taxable year, but that the payments therefor shall be proper expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year.\n It is urged that under section 212(b) of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1064, 1065) the Commissioner was entitled to disallow the deduction in the return for 1920, \n\n[281 U.S. 115, 120]\n\u00a0\n upon the ground that if it were allowed the return would not clearly reflect the income for that year. It is said that the basic principle to be applied is that the true net income is to be taxed. Section 212(b) provides:\n'(b) The net income shall be computed upon the basis of the taxpayer's annual accounting period (fiscal year or calendar year, as the case may be) in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of such taxpayer; but if no such method of accounting has been so employed, or if the method employed does not clearly reflect the income, the computation shall be made upon such basis and in such manner as in the opinion of the Commissioner does clearly reflect the income. ...'\n\n This section relates to the method of accounting; the Commissioner may make the computation on a basis that does clearly reflect the income, if the method employed by the taxpayer does not. But this section does not justify the Commissioner in allocating to previous years a reasonable allowance as compensation for services actually rendered, when the compensation was properly paid during the taxable year and the obligation to pay was incurred during that year and not previously. In the present instance, the expense could not be attributed to earlier years, for it was neither paid nor incurred in those years. There was no earlier accrual of liability. It was deductible in the year 1920 or not at all. Being deductible as a reasonable payment, there was no authority vested in the Commissioner to disregard the actual transaction and to readjust the income on another basis which did not respond to the facts.\n The case of United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422\n, 46 S. Ct. 131, is not in point, as there the liability for the munitions tax at a fixed rate had accrued in the earlier year (1916) and was a charge on the business of that year, although the precise amount was ascertained and was payable in 1917. In \n\n[281 U.S. 115, 121]\n\u00a0\n American National Co. v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 99\n, 47 S. Ct. 520, there was a contract providing definitely for the payment. Compare Lucas, as Commissioner of Internal Revenue, v. American Code Co., \n280 \nU.S. 445\n, 50 S. Ct. 202, decided by this Court February 24, 1930\n\n\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLUCAS v.

Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Henry M. Ward, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Using therefor what is known as 'Form 1013T,' on March 14, 1919, respondent, Pilliod Lumber Company, executed and filed with the collector of internal revenue a tentative return and estimate of corporate income and profits taxes for 1918, signed and sworn to by its president and treasurer. At the same time it remitted $1,000, one-fourth of the estimated taxes, and requested an extension of forty-five days within which to present a final report as required by law.\n May 31, 1919, it lodged with the collector another return for 1918, made out upon Form 1120, which contained various statements in respect of gross income, deductions, credits, etc., but was not signed or sworn to by anyone.\n In answer to a request from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, respondent's president and treasurer swore to and filed with him, September 17, 1923, the following affidavit concerning the return of May 31-\n'We, the undersigned, hereby affirm that our names should have appeared on our income tax return for 1918, and which to the best of our knowledge and belief is correct. We are unable to furnish duplicate signed report, being unable to locate copy, believing same to have been destroyed with other records.' \n\n[281 U.S. 245, 247]\n\u00a0\n Two years later, October 23, 1925, the Commissioner notified the company of a deficiency assessment amounting to $963.34. Affirming that any claim for such tax had been extinguished by the five-year statute of limitations, it appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals. They held that neither the tentative return of March, 1919, nor the later unsworn one, was adequate to set the statute of limitations in motion and affirmed the Commissioner's ruling. The Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the unsworn return was adequate and upon that ground reversed the action of the Board without expressing any opinion concerning the effect of the tentative return.\n\n The Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1081, 1083, provides:\n'Sec. 239. That every corporation subject to taxation under this title and every personal service corporation shall make a return, stating specifically the items of its gross income and the deductions and credits allowed by this title. The return shall be sworn to by the president, vice president, or other principal officer and by the treasurer or assistant treasurer. ...'\n\n'Sec. 250. ... (d) Except in the case of false or fraudulent returns with intent to evade the tax, the amount of tax due under any return shall be determined and assessed by the Commissioner within five years after the return was due or was made, and no suit or proceeding for the collection of any tax shall be begun after the expiration of five years after the date when the return was due or was made. in the case of such false of fraudulent returns, the amount of tax due may be determined at any time after the return is filed, and the tax may be collected at any time after it becomes due.'\n\n The Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 287, 299, 301, by section 239(a), 26 USCA  991(a), requires corporations to make returns like those prescribed by the Act of 1918. Sec- \n\n[281 U.S. 245, 248]\n\u00a0\n tion 277(a), 26 USCA  1057, note, directs that except as provided in section 278 (26 USCA  1058-1062 note), which relates to false or fraudulent returns, and certain subdivisions of section 274 (26 USCA  1048-1057 note) and 279 (26 USCA  1063 note), not presently important, taxes for 1921, and afterwards, shall be assessed within four years after return filed; also that taxes for 1918, etc., shall be assessed within five years after return filed. Section 280 (26 USCA  1064 note) declares: If hereafter the Commissioner determines that any assessment should be made in respect of any income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax imposed by the Revenue Acts of 1916, 1917, 1918, or 1921, the amount which should be assessed (whether as deficiency or as interest, penalty, or other addition to the tax) shall be computed as if this act had not been enacted, but the amount so computed shall be assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations (including the provisions in case of delinquency in payment after notice and demand) as in the case of the taxes imposed by this title, except as otherwise provided in section 277.\n Respondent maintains that the five-year statute of limitations began to run against the claim for 1918 taxes when the tentative return of March 14, 1919, was filed with the collector, or when he received the unverified return, May 31, 1919, and therefore the deficiency assessment of October 23, 1925, was out of time.\n The argument based upon the supposed effect of the first or tentative return is the same as that considered and rejected in Florsheim Bros., etc ., v. United States (White, Collector, v. Hood Rubber Co.), \n280 \nU.S. 453\n, 50 S. Ct. 215, decided February 24, 1930\n\n\n That the so-called return of May 31, 1919, unsupported by oath, did not then meet the definite requirements of section 239 is manifest. But, respondent says the defect was cured or became immaterial since the tax officers accepted and held the return for several years, and in 1923 requested and obtained an adequate verification by the proper corporate officers. \n\n[281 U.S. 245, 249]\n\u00a0\n Under the established general rule a statute of limitation runs against the United States only when they assent and upon the conditions prescribed. Here assent that the statute might begin to run was conditioned upon the presentation of a return duly sworn to. No officer had power to substitute something else for the thing specified. The return so long as it remained unverified by oath of proper corporate officers did not meet the plain requirements. The necessity for meticulous compliance by the taxpayer with all named conditions in order to secure the benefit of the limitation was distinctly pointed out in Florsheim Bros., etc., v. United States, supra.\n The Board of Tax Appeals reached the proper result. The judgment of the court below must be reversed.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","82":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLUCKENBACH S. S. CO. v. UNITED STATES(1930)\nNo. 49\nArgued: Decided: January 6, 1930\n\n\n\n Messrs. George A. King and William B. King, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioner. \n\n[280 U.S. 173, 174]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Sisson, for the United States.\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 173, 176]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit in the Court of Claims by the Luckenbach Steamship Company, petitioner, against the United States, to recover $30,370.94, claimed by the petitioner as a balance due for transporting mails of the United States, in steamships of United States registry, between ports of the United States and ports in the Canal Zone from December 1, 1925, to June 30, 1926. Judgment went against the petitioner (66 Ct. Cl. 679), and a petition to this court for a review on certiorari was granted.\n That the petitioner rendered the service stated and did so at the request of the Postmaster General is not questioned. The only matter in dispute is the true measure of compensation. The Postmaster General allowed the sum of $82,851.62 and transmitted approved vouchers therefor to the General Accounting Office for direct settlement; but that office reduced the allowance to $52,480.68, and caused this reduced sum to be paid to the petitioner. Thereupon suit was brought for the balance.\n The Postmaster General, in making his allowance, proceeded on the theory that the compensation was to be determined according to section 4009 of the Revised Statutes (39 USCA  654); but the General Accounting Office regarded that section as inapplicable. If the section was applicable, the Post- \n\n[280 U.S. 173, 177]\n\u00a0\n master General's allowance was right, and should have been given effect by the Court of Claims.\n Section 4009, which originally was part of the Act of June 8, 1872 ( chapter 335,  269, 17 Stat. 316), consolidating and amending the statutes relating to the Post Office Department, reads as follows:\n'Sec. 4009. For transporting the mail between the United States and any foreign port, or between ports of the United States touching at a foreign port, the Postmaster General may allow as compensation, if by a United States steamship, any sum not exceeding the sea and United States inland postage; and if by a foreign steamship or by a sailing vessel, any sum not exceeding the sea postage, on the mail so transported.'\n\n The specific point of difference between the Postmaster General and the General Accounting Office was that the former treated the ports in the Canal Zone as foreign ports within the meaning of that section, while the latter regarded them as domestic ports.\n The rights possessed by the United States within the Canal Zone were acquired from the Republic of Panama under the Treaty of November 18, 1903, 33 Stat. 2234. The Zone has a width of 10 miles and extends across the Isthmus of Panama and into the sea at either end for a distance of 3 marine miles from mean low-water mark; but the cities of Panama and Colon and the harbors adjacent to them, although within the outer boundaries of the Zone, are expressly excepted thereunder by the second article of the treaty.\n Whether the grant in the treaty amounts to a complete cession of territory and dominion to the United States, or is so limited that it leaves at least titular sovereignty in the Republic of Panama, is a question which has been the subject of diverging opinions1 and is much discussed in the \n\n[280 U.S. 173, 178]\n\u00a0\n briefs. But for the purposes of this case the construction of the treaty in that regard need not be examined as an original question;-and this because a long continued course of legislative and administrative action has operated to require that the ports in the Canal Zone be regarded as foreign ports within the meaning of section 4009\n\n\n By the Act of March 2, 1905, c. 1311, 33 Stat. 843 (19 USCA  126 and note), which came within less than two years after the treaty, Congress declared that the laws regulating the importation of merchandise and the entry of persons into the United States from foreign countries should apply to and control the importation of merchandise and the entry of persons from the Canal Zone into any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia; and on September 8, 1909 (27 Op. Attys. Gen. 594), the Attorney General, in an opinion given to the Secretary of War, held that the Canal Zone was not a possession of the United States within the meaning of the Tariff Act of August 5, 1909, c. 6, 36 Stat. 11, imposing specified rates of duty upon various articles when imported from a foreign country into the United States or 'into any of its possessions.'\n In 1911 the Postmaster General, being authorized by an Act of March 3, 1891, c. 519, 26 Stat. 830, to arrange for the transportation of mails in American steamships between ports in the United States and foreign ports, submitted to the Attorney General the question whether, as respects mails largely intended for the cities of Colon and Panama, it would be within the letter and spirit of that act to arrange for the carrying of such mails from the ports of New York and San Francisco to the government docks at Cristobal and Balboa in the Canal Zone. The Attorney General responded in the affirmative, saying (29 Op. Attys. Gen. 194, 196):\n'It appears from the papers transmitted by you that it will be more convenient for the vessels contracting for \n\n[280 U.S. 173, 179]\n\u00a0\n this mail service to use principally the government docks, which are being constructed at Cristobal on the Atlantic side and Balboa on the Pacific side; and the question arises whether by using these docks, which are in close proximity to but outside the limits of the cities of Colon and Panama and within the Canal Zone, and vessels would be carrying mails to foreign ports. It is stated in this connection that docking the large vessels at the cities of Colon and Panama would result in serious loss of time, and that the actual call at these places could be obviated by the use of a tender to meet the vessels upon entering the 'harbor adjacent to these ports' to receive and deliver the mail in Colon and Panama, the vessels then proceeding to the government docks at Cristobal and Balboa.\n\n'It has been held that the purpose of the Act of March 3, 1891, is 'to promote the carriage of the ocean mails in ships of American register, and thereby to promote ocean commerce in American bottoms,' and that this statute, 'designed to promote foreign commerce, is entitled to a liberal construction, with a view to carrying out the purpose of its enactment.' 20 Op. 98, 101.\n\n'In my opinion, the service proposed is in substantial compliance with the letter and spirit of the statute, as being between 'ports of the United States' and 'ports of foreign countries.' The word 'port' is not limited in its application to the city which bears the same name, but has been defined as including the entire harbor, within its inclosures and projections of land, where ships take refuge and seek shelter (citing authorities). Construing the word 'port' as synonymous with 'harbor' the vessels unquestionably would be carrying the mails to a foreign port if they entered the harbor, since the treaty reserves to Panama not only the cities of Panama and Colon, but also 'the harbors adjacent to said cities.' In any event, I think that carrying the mails upon such vessels within \n\n[280 U.S. 173, 180]\n\u00a0\n such close proximity to said cities that they might safely be landed in a small boat would be a substantial compliance with the terms of the act.'\n\n By section 12 of an Act of August 24, 1912, c. 390, 37 Stat. 569 (48 USCA  1330), Congress, while extending to the Canal Zone the laws of the United States relating to extradition and the rendition of fugitives from justice, declared that for such purposes, 'and such purposes only,' the Zone should be treated as an organized Territory of the United States; and by section 9 of an Act of August 21, 1916, c. 371, 39 Stat. 529 (48 USCA  1331), Congress provided that the laws of the United States relating to seamen of vessels of the United States when 'on foreign voyages' should apply to the seamen of all vessels of the United States when in the Canal Zone.\n In 1925, the Department of Labor, construing a provision in the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, c. 29, 39 Stat. 874, relating to seamen on board vessels arriving in the United States from 'any foreign port or place,' ruled that the ports in the Canal Zone should be deemed foreign ports in the sense of that act, paragraph 4, rule 6, Immigration Laws and Rules of 1925; and in 1926 the Comptroller General held that, as ports in the Canal Zone are considered foreign ports in the absence of special provision to the contrary, an alien seaman shipping on an American vessel from a port in the Canal Zone is limited in the matter of relief to such as may be extended to an alien seaman shipping on an American vessel from a foreign port. 5 Dec. Comp. Gen. 647.\n True, there have been instances in which Congress specially provided that for particular purposes the Canal Zone should be treated as a territory or possession of the United States. This is illustrated in the provision already cited relating to extradition and the rendition of fugitives from justice, and in the acts relating to the liability of carriers by railroad for injuries suffered by their employees, Act April 22, 1908, \n\n[280 U.S. 173, 181]\n\u00a0\n c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 (45 USCA  51-59); to espionage, Act June 15, 1917, c. 30, title 13, 40 Stat. 231; and to sabotage, Act April 20, 1918, c. 59, 40 Stat. 533 (50 USCA  101-103). But the purposes for which these special provisions were made were such that nothing was subtracted thereby from the force of the provisions before mentioned wherein for purposes connected with importation, immigration and ocean transportation between the United States and the Canal Zone Congress required that ports in the latter be regarded as foreign ports.\n For a period of years and continuously to December 1, 1925, the Postmaster General tendered to the petitioner and the latter accepted for transportation in American steamships, and so transported for the United States, large quantities of mail between the United States and ports in the Canal Zone; and for this service the petitioner was paid the compensation intended by section 4009-the Postmaster General and the accounting officers treating the ports in the Canal Zone as foreign ports in the sense of that section.\n The service just described was continued without break into and through the period here in controversy-December 1, 1925, to June 30, 1926- and the Postmaster General, still treating the Canal Zone ports as foreign ports, allowed the same compensation as before. For this period, and this alone, the accounting officers declined to regard those ports as foreign ports. The service was continued after the period in question and for this later service the Postmaster General and the accounting officers concurred in allowing the compensation intended by section 4009, the accounting officers resting their assent upon an Act of Congress of July 3, 1926, c. 793, 44 Stat. Part 2, p. 900 (39 USCA  654 and note).\n It thus appears, as was said by the Postmaster General in a letter of July 23, 1926, to the petitioner, that the Post Office Department from the outset and continuously up to and through the period in question 'considered \n\n[280 U.S. 173, 182]\n\u00a0\n the service to the Canal Zone as being in the same category as that to a foreign country' and approved compensation vouchers on that basis.\n This recitation of pertinent legislative and administrative action demonstrates that this case is one in which we should apply the rule announced in U. S. v. Alabama Great Southern R. R. Co., \n142 \nU.S. 615, 621\n, 12 S. Ct. 306, 308, where it was said:\n'We think the contemporaneous construction thus given by the executive department of the government, and continued for nine years through six different administrations of that department-a construction which, though inconsistent with the literalism of the act, certainly consorts with the equities of the case-should be considered as decisive in this suit. It is a settled doctrine of this court that in case of ambiguity the judicial department will lean in favor of a construction given to a statute by the department charged with the execution of such statute, and, if such construction be acted upon for a number of years, will look with disfavor upon any sudden change, whereby parties who have contracted with the government upon the faith of such construction may be prejudiced.'\n\n Our conclusion also has obvious support in the Act of July 3, 1926, supra, whereby section 4009 was re-enacted in a form which undoubtedly puts ports in the Canal Zone on the same plane as foreign ports for the purposes of that section. The committee reports relating to that enactment show that it was particularly designed to meet and avoid the adverse ruling of the General Accounting Office and to continue the prior course of action respecting the measure of compensation to be paid for carrying mails between the United States and the Canal Zone; that it was intended to recognize, as the prior practice did, that for 'all practical purposes' such mails 'are foreign mails'; and that the purpose of the act was not to \n\n[280 U.S. 173, 183]\n\u00a0\n alter the rates paid to American ships, 'but to clarify the law.'

Sachs, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioners. \n\n[281 U.S. 238, 239]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 238, 242]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By a written instrument dated October 1, 1917, Pauline May, wife of Barney May, 'transferred, set over and assigned' to him and others, as trustees (with power to change the investments), certain described securities-bonds, notes, corporate stocks, and money-in trust, to collect the income therefrom, and after discharging taxes, expenses, etc., to pay the balance 'to Barney May during his lifetime, and after his decease, to Pauline May during her lifetime, and after her decease, all the property in said Trust, in whatever form or shape it may be, shall, after the expenses of the Trust have been deducted or paid, be distributed equally among' her four children, their distributees, or appointees.\n Mrs. May died March 25, 1920. Thereafter the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, purporting to proceed under authority of the Revenue Act of 1918, tit. 4, 40 Stat. 1057, 1096, 1097, demanded that her executors pay additional taxes reckoned upon the value of the property held under the above-described trust instrument. Having paid the required sum, the executors-petitioners here-asked that it be refunded. By order of February \n\n[281 U.S. 238, 243]\n\u00a0\n 20, 1924, the Commissioner denied their request. In support of this action he said:\n'This trust was included in decedent's gross estate on final audit and review on the ground that it was intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death. In this case the principal of the trust fund could not take effect in possession until the death of the decedent. According to the provisions of the trust agreement, if the decedent's husband died before her, the income was to be paid to her until her death. The gift of the principal, therefore, could not take effect during the decedent's lifetime. This case comes literally within the terms of the statute, and it has been held by a number of courts in different States that such a transfer as this is taxable, these cases being decided under statutes using the same language as is contained in the Federal Estate Tax Law.'\n\n Seeking to enforce their claim the executors sued the collector in the District Court, Western District of Pennsylvania; judgment in his favor was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The matter is here upon certiorari.\n The record fails clearly to disclose whether or no Mrs. May survived her husband. Apparently she did not. But this is not of special importance, since the refund should have been allowed in either event.\n The transfer of October 1, 1917, was not made in contemplation of death within the legal significance of those words. It was not testamentary in character and was beyond recall by the decedent. At the death of Mrs. May no interest in the property held under the trust deed passed from her to the living; title thereto had been definitely fixed by the trust deed. The interest therein which she possessed immediately prior to her death was obliterated by that event. \n\n[281 U.S. 238, 244]\n\u00a0\n Section 401, Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1096), lays a charge 'upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent dying after the passage of this Act,' and section 402 directs that 'the value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated ...

This court said:\n'In its plan and scope the tax is one imposed on transfers at death or made in contemplation of death and is measured by the value at death of the interest which is transferred. ... One may freely give his property to another by absolute gift without subjecting himself or his estate to a tax, but we are asked to say that this statute means that he may not make a gift inter vivos, equally absolute and complete, without subjecting it to a tax if the gift takes the form of a life estate in one with remainder over to another at or after the donor's death. It would require plain and compelling language to justify so incongruous a result and we think it is wanting in the present statute. ...\n\n'In the light of the general purpose of the statute and the language of section 401 explicitly imposing the tax on net \n\n[281 U.S. 238, 245]\n\u00a0\n estates of decedents, we think it at least doubtful whether the trusts or interests in a trust intended to be reached by the phrase in section 402(c) 'to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death,' include any others than those passing from the possession, enjoyment or control of the donor at his death and so taxable as transfers at death under section 401.

Breitenstein, of Denver, Colo., for petitioner.\n Claude R. Branch, of Providence, R. I., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner brought this action against the respondent in a federal District Court to require the reinstatement of a lapsed insurance policy issued under the War Risk Insurance Act of October 6, 1917, c. 105,  400, 40 Stat. 398, 409; amended August 9, 1921, c. 57,  27, 42 Stat. 147, 156, 157. It was alleged that, being enlisted in the United States Army during the World War, he applied for and obtained, under the act, a policy of insurance in the sum of $10,000 against death and permanent and total disability. Thereafter, on February 1, 1920, $3,000 of this amount was converted into a twenty-payment life policy, and the remaining $7,000 was allowed to lapse. In March, 1923, petitioner applied to the Director of the United States Veterans' Bureau for reinstatement of the policy in respect of the $7,000, asserting that he was then suffering from a disability of a degree less than permanent and total. The director of the bureau rejected the ap- \n\n[281 U.S. 271, 273]\n\u00a0\n plication, and thereupon petitioner brought this action. The government answered, denying certain allegations and admitting others, and alleging that, at the time of the application for reinstatement, and for a long time prior thereto, petitioner was permanently and totally disabled.\n The case was tried by the court without a jury, and judgment rendered reinstating the policy to the extent of $7,000. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment upon the ground that the trial court was without jurisdiction, and directed a dismissal of the petition. 32 F.(2d) 440.\n Prior to the amending act of 1921, there was not statutory provision for the reinstatement of lapsed policies, but the matter was one of Bureau regulation. By section 408 of that act, carried into the act of 1924 as section 304, c. 320, 43 Stat. 607, 625 (U. S. Code, title 38,  515 (38 USCA  515)), it was provided:\n'In the event that all provisions of the rules and regulations other than the requirements as to the physical condition of the applicant for insurance have been complied with an application for reinstatement, in whole or in part, of lapsed or canceled yearly renewable term insurance or United States Government life insurance ( converted insurance) hereafter made may be approved if made within one year after July 2, 1926, or within two years after the date of lapse or cancellation: ... Provided further, That the applicant during his lifetime submits proof satisfactory to the director showing that he is not totally and permanently disabled.'\n\n The director denied the application on the ground that the applicant, at the time of making it, was totally and permanently disabled. The trial court held the contrary. The evidence upon which the director acted was \n\n[281 U.S. 271, 274]\n\u00a0\n not before the court, but the case was decided upon original evidence introduced upon the trial. The question was purely one of fact, which the director was authorized to determine; and his decision, unless within section 19 of the World War Veterans' Act of 1924, dealt with below, was final and conclusive. United States v. Williams, \n278 \nU.S. 255\n, 49 S. Ct. 97; Silberschein v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 221, 225\n, 45 S. Ct. 69.\n Section 19 of the act of 1924, as amended March 4, 1925, c. 553,  2, 43 Stat. 1302 (U. S. Code, title 38,  445 (38 USCA  445)), provides in part:\n'In the event of disagreement as to claim under a contract of insurance between the Bureau and any person or persons claiming thereunder an action on the claim may be brought against the United States either in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia or in the District Court of the United States in and for the district in which such persons or any one of them resides, and jurisdiction is conferred upon such courts to hear and determine all such controversies.'\n\n This provision, we think, has nothing to do with an application for reinstatement of a defunct policy. The right to reinstatement, when it exists flows from the statutory provision and not from any undertaking expressed in the contract of insurance. No doubt, the policyholder may have the benefit of the statute, although passed subsequently to the issue of the policy, White v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 175, 180\n, 46 S. Ct. 274, but a reinstatement under the provisions of the statute would be not the fulfillment of a contractual obligation, but, in effect the making of a new contract by statutory sanction.\n AEtna Life Ins. Co. v. Dunken, \n266 \nU.S. 389\n, 45 S. Ct. 129, upon which petitioner here relies, is not to the contrary. There the original policy of insurance was a seven-year term \n\n[281 U.S. 271, 275]\n\u00a0\n policy. It provided expressly that upon any anniversary of its date, at the sole option of the insured, without medical re-examination, it was convertible into a twenty-payment life commercial policy, etc. It was held that the converted policy was merely a continuation of the old one. This court said (page 399 of 266 U. S., 45 S. Ct. 129, 132):\n'In effect, it is as though the first policy had provided that upon demand of the insured and payment of the stipulated increase in premiums that policy should, automatically, become a 20-payment life commercial policy. It was issued not as the result of any new negotiation or agreement but in discharge of pre-existing obligations. It merely fulfilled promises then outstanding; and did not arise from new or additional promises. The result in legal contemplation was not a novation but the consummation of an alternative specifically accorded by, and enforceable in virtue of, the original contract. If the insurance company had refused to issue the second policy upon demand, the insured could have compelled it by a suit in equity for specific performance.'\n\n The situation in the present case is altogether different. The original policy had come to an end; liability under it had wholly ceased; a new application was required, together with proof of an existing condition sufficient to satisfy the director, before reinstatement could be made. The effect of the statute is to accord the privilege of reinstatement to the holder of a lapsed policy, not to read into it a promise to that end. The existence of the old policy is, of course, a necessary prerequisite to the consideration of a claim for the allowance of the statutory privilege, but the claim is one under the statute, not under the contract, and, consequently, does not fall within the terms of section 19.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","86":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMILLER v.

Smith, of Omaha, Neb., for petitioner.\n Mr. C. A. Sorensen, of Lincoln, Neb., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The middle of the channel of the Missouri river is the boundary line between the states of Nebraska and Iowa. Act April 19, 1864, c. 59,  2, 13 Stat. 47; Act Aug. 4, 1846, c. 82, 9 Stat. 52. A Nebraska statute prohibits the taking of 'any fish except minnows from the waters within the state of Nebraska with nets, traps or seines,' and made the possession of these unlawful, 'except as authorized by the Department of Agriculture.' Laws of Nebraska (1927), c. 126,  10, pp. 343-4. An Iowa statute provides: 'It shall be lawful for any person to take from the Mississippi or Missouri rivers within the jurisdiction of this state any fish with nets or seines upon procuring from the state game warden an annual license for the use of such nets and seines.' Code of Iowa (1927),  1747\n\n\n Miller, a resident of Nebraska, brought this suit in a court of that state, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, to enjoin the enforcement of the Nebraska statute. Its secretary of the department of agriculture and chief game warden were joined as defendants. Miller alleges that he has in his possession nets, traps, and \n\n[281 U.S. 261, 263]\n\u00a0\n seines purchased by him prior to the enactment of the law; that they are used exclusively in taking fish from the Missouri river; that he plans to use them on the Iowa side; and that the defendants are threatening to prevent their use by enforcing the statute. He claims that, in the absence of concurrence by Iowa, Nebraska is powerless to prohibit the fishing, even in that part of the Missouri river which is within its own boundaries, because, on admitting Iowa into the Union Congress had granted it 'concurrent jurisdiction on ... every ... river bordering on the said State of Iowa, so far as the said river(s) shall form a common boundary to said State, and any other state. ...' Act March 3, 1845, c. 48,  3, 5 Stat. 742, 743. He asserts that, in any event, the prohibition of the mere possession of innocuous traps, nets, and seines violates the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court issued an injunction. The Supreme Court of the state reversed the decree and directed that the bill be dismissed (Neb.) 224 N. W. 18. This Court granted a writ of certiorari, \n280 \nU.S. 541\n, 50 S. Ct. 31, 74 L. Ed. -.\n The grant of concurrent jurisdiction to Iowa does not deprive Nebraska of power to legislate with respect to its own residents within its own territorial limits. Nicoulin v. O'Brien, \n248 \nU.S. 113\n, 39 S. Ct. 23; compare McGowan v. Columbia River Packers' Ass'n, \n245 \nU.S. 352\n, 38 S. Ct. 129. While the two states have not concurred in this legislation, there is no conflict between them. Each has legislated only as to that part of the river which is within its own territorial limits. It is unnecessary to consider the questions which might arise if Nebraska undertook to prohibit the fishing on Iowa's part of the river, or if Miller were a citizen of Iowa and fished under an Iowa license. Compare Nielsen v. Oregon, \n212 \nU.S. 315\n, 29 S. Ct. 383. Neither Miller, nor any of the persons in whose behalf he brought the suit, have licenses from Iowa; nor does it appear that they could obtain them. \n\n[281 U.S. 261, 264]\n\u00a0\n The claim under the Fourteenth Amendment is also groundless. A state may regulate or prohibit fishing within its waters, Manchester v. Massachusetts, \n139 \nU.S. 240\n, 11 S. Ct. 559; Lawton v. Steele, \n152 \nU.S. 133\n, 14 S. Ct. 499; Geer v. Connecticut, \n161 \nU.S. 519\n, 16 S.

MAGMA COPPER CO.(1930)\nNo. 71\nArgued: January 9, 1930Decided: February 24, 1930\n\n\n\n Messrs. Wm. Houston Kenyon and Henry D. Williams, both of New York City, for petitioner. \n\n[280 U.S. 400, 401]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William H. Davis and Merton W. Sage, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit for the infringement of Letters Patent, No. 962678, Claims 1 and 2, brought by the petitioner in the District Court of Maine, where the petitioner prevalid (23 F.(2d) 931), the Court acting partly in deference to the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Miami Copper Co. v. Minerals Separation, Ltd., 244 F. 752. The decision of the District Court was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, 30 F.(2d) 67, and because of the conflict with the Third Circuit, a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n279 \nU.S. 832\n, 49 S. Ct. 481.\n The claims are (1) for a 'process of concentrating ores which consists in mixing the powdered ore with water containing in solution a small quantity of a mineral frothing agent, agitating the mixture to form a froth and separating the froth,' and (2) the same as (1) except that it inserts the word 'organic' before 'mineral frothing agent.' The only defence that it is necessary to consider is that the disclosure is anticipated by the earlier patent, No. 835120, which has been before this Court in Minerals Separation Ltd., v. Hyde, \n242 \nU.S. 261\n, 37 S. Ct. 82, and Minerals Separation, Ltd., v. Butte & Superior Mining Co., \n250 \nU.S. 336\n, 39 S. Ct. 496. It is enough to refer to those cases without repeating them. The process described in 835120 'consists in mixing the powdered ore with water, adding a small proportion of an oily liquid having a preferential affinity for metalliferous matter ( amounting to a fraction of one per cent. on the ore), agitating the mixture until the oil coated mineral matter forms into a froth, and separating the froth from the remainder by flotation.' The specification describes the object as being to separate metalliferous matter, &c., from gangue by means of oils, \n\n[280 U.S. 400, 402]\n\u00a0\n fatty acids, 'or other substances which have a preferential affinity for metalliferous matter over gangue.' It refers to a previous patent to Cattermole by which a considerable amount of oil is used to form granules, and announces the discovery that if the proportion of oily substance is reduced to, say, a fraction of one per cent. on the ores, granulation ceases to take place, and on vigorous agitation the ore instead of sinking forms a froth on the surface that can be removed. The process is helped by the addition of a little acid, by warming and the fine pulverization of the pulp.\n The petitioners, admitting that both patents are for processes, says that they are fundamentally different in their respective principles of action; that in the present patent, 962678, the mineral frothing agent is dissolved in the water and produces the metal bearing bubbles, no one knows exactly how, by 'modifying the water'; whereas in the earlier, 835120, oil is used which does not dissolve in the water but coats the particles of metal with a thin coating of oil, which it could not do if it were soluble, and thus shows its preferential affinity when shaken up with the metal pulp.\n The question is not what is the precise scope of the claims in 835120, but what is disclosed in the specification and made known to the world. Alexander Milburn Co. v. Davis-Bournonville Co., \n270 \nU.S. 390\n, 46 S. Ct. 324. Therefore we are relieved of the inquiry whether the words 'oily liquid' in Claim (1) can be read as a shorthand expression for the previously mentioned oils 'and other substances which have a preferential affinity for metalliferous matter over gangue,' as 'oil' was expressly interpreted in earlier patents, including one to Cattermole referred to at some length in 835120, and as there is evidence that it thus was understood by men skilled in the art. It is disclosed that it was well known there were other substances besides oil that had the preferential affinity and \n\n[280 U.S. 400, 403]\n\u00a0\n that could be used. The nature of the affinity is not specified and it cannot be confined to the kind of action shown by oil. It is neither said nor implied that the added element must be insoluble or that it must coat the metal, although it is assumed in accordance with the prevailing theory that the metal will be coated when the oil mentioned in the claims is used. All that is required is that in some effective way the other substance should pick the metal out. It is said that oil does it by coating the metal particles and that of course a substance in solution could not do that. There is no 'of course' as to what nature can do, except as proved by observation and experiment. A substance in solution can combine chemically with another and become a solid. Whether a given thing will unite mechanically or whether by its presence it will promote an activity in which it does not share, is to be found out by trial not by reasoning, and the petitioner agrees that in this case we do not know. It is a matter of reasoning rather than of observation that the oil coats the mineral particles. The experts differ whether the same thing does not take place when a soluble substance is used. But we agree with the defendant's argument that no one concerned in this business would care a straw as to the intimate nature of the action if it produced the result, and that No. 835120 was not describing the work of insolubles alone. It was not attempting to anticipate a theory of the invisible, but to tell how the practical end could be achieved with any of the different things named.\n The discovery was that a very minute portion of the oil worked in an unexpectedly different way from that familiar with larger quantities-not in the matter of coating the particles, but in helping to produce a froth that floated instead of granules that sank, and thus in preserving the slime made by the smaller particles with the water, and so saving a large proportion of metal that \n\n[280 U.S. 400, 404]\n\u00a0\n otherwise would have been lost. The fact was a general one. No particular oil was mentioned and the fact was not confined to oils. The public was directed to make a 'simple preliminary test to determine which oily substance yields the proportion of froth or scum desired.' The patent having been held good as to the oils although experiment was necessary to find out what oil would work best with a given ore the disclosure was an anticipation although experiment might be necessary to chose among the substances having the required affinity the one that would produce the best result.\n The petitioner adverts to the success that has attended the later patent and to the fact that the world waited until it appeared. But interlopers naturally would be slow to venture into the field occupied by a powerful company armed with patent No. 835120 and supported by a subtle ingenuity that we cannot doubt would have been exercised with even more effect to show that a process like that in No. 962678 was an infringement than it now is to prove that the later patent was a revelation that transformed the art.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","88":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOORE v.

Petitioner as such treasurer brought this suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to recover $958,516.22 claimed as delinquent taxes. The respondents moved to dismiss on the grounds that the complaint failed to state a cause of action, that the court had no jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and that petitioner had not legal capacity to sue. The court declined jurisdiction and entered a decree dismissing the complaint. 28 F.(2d) 997. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 30 F.(2d) 600.\n From 1884 until his death on October 14, 1926, the testator was a resident and citizen of Grant county, Ind. \n\n[281 U.S. 18, 23]\n\u00a0\n During the last 24 years of that period he owned stock of corporations and other intangible property in respect of which there had been no return, assessment, or payment of taxes. After testator's death, the county auditor, acting, as it is alleged, under authority of the statutes of Indiana, ascertained the value in each year of the omitted property, assessed taxes thereon for state, county, city, and township purposes, and charged the same against such property and the executors. By the statutes of Indiana (section 14,299, Burns' Ann. Statutes 1926) it is made the duty of the treasurer of each county to collect the taxes imposed therein for county, city, and other purposes. By section 1, c. 54, Session Laws of 1927, county treasurers are authorized to 'institute and prosecute to final judgment and execution, all suits and proceedings necessary for the collection of delinquent taxes owing by any person residing outside of the State of Indiana, or by his legal representatives. ...' The recovery here sought is for Grant county, the city of Marion and the other political subdivisions therein of which the testator was a resident during the years for which such assessments were made.\n The first question for consideration is whether petitioner had authority to bring this suit.\n The United States District Court in New York exercises a jurisdiction that is independent of and under a sovereignty that is different from that of Indiana. Grant v. Leach & Co., \n280 \nU.S. 351\n, 50 S. Ct. 107; Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 714\n, 732. And, so far as concerns petitioner's capacity to sue therein, that court is not to be distinguished from the courts of the state of New York. Hale v. Allinson, \n188 \nU.S. 56, 68\n, 23 S. Ct. 244.\n Petitioner claims only by virtue of his office. Indiana is powerless to give any force or effect beyond her own limits to the act of 1927 purporting to authorize this suit \n\n[281 U.S. 18, 24]\n\u00a0\n or to the other statutes empowering and prescribing the duties of its officers in respect of the levy and collection of taxes. And, as Indiana laws are the sole source of petitioner's authority, it follows that he had none in New York. Mechem, Public Offices and Officers,  508; McCullough v. Scott, 182 N. C. 865, 873, 109 S. E. 789. He is the mere arm of the state for the collection of taxes for some of its subdivisions, and has no better standing to bring suits in courts outside Indiana than have executors, administrators, or chancery receivers without title, appointed under the laws and by the courts of that state. It is well understood that they are without authority, in their official capacity, to sue as of right in the federal courts in other states. From the earliest time, federal courts in one state have declined to take jurisdiction of suits by executors and administrators appointed in another state. Dixon's Executors v. Ramsey's Executors, 3 Cranch, 319, 323; Kerr v. Moon, 9 Wheat. 565, 571; Vaughan v. Northup, 15 Pet. 1, 5. And since the decision of this court in Booth v. Clark, 17 How. 322, it has been the practice in federal courts to limit such receivers to suits in the jurisdiction in which they are appointed. Great Western Mining Co. v. Harris, \n198 \nU.S. 561, 578\n, 25 S. Ct. 770; Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 \nU.S. 243, 257\n, 32 S. Ct. 415; Sterrett v. Second National Bank, \n248 \nU.S. 73, 76\n, 39 S. Ct. 27. The reasons on which rests this long-established practice in respect of executors, administrators, and such receivers apply with full force here. We conclude that petitioner lacked legal capacity to sue.\n It is not necessary to express any opinion upon the question considered below, whether a federal court in one state will enforce the revenue laws of another state.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","89":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL FIRE INS.

Any reduction ordered ... shall be applied, subject to his approval: Provided, that the superintendent of insurance shall designate the class or classes to which the reduction shall be applied if the companies do not, within thirty days from the order of reduction, submit a class or classes which meet his approval. ...'\n\n Section 6284 provides that the orders of the superintendent shall be reviewable by the courts, that upon such review the entire matter shall be determined de novo, \n\n[281 U.S. 331, 334]\n\u00a0\n and that, while it is pending, insurers shall not charge any rate in excess of that fixed by the superintendent.\n January 5, 1922, the superintendent had directed that rates on all fire, lightning, hail, and windstorm insurance be reduced 15 per cent. The plaintiff and other stock insurance companies doing business in Missouri brought a joint suit in the circuit court of Cole county to enjoin the enforcement of that order. Temporary restraint was granted. The attorneys for the respective parties entered into a stipulation reciting that the superintendent had revoked the rate order and agreeing that there be entered of record in the case an order in substance as follows:\n The case is dismissed and the restraining order dissolved.\n The superintendent may call a hearing to investigate the necessity for a rate reduction; the companies will produce evidence required by him or that they may see fit to present; at the conclusion of the hearing he will make findings of fact and announce his determination thereon, and he shall also make certain specified findings.\n If, based on such findings and determination, an order be made reducing rates, it will apply alike to all classes of risks, and, if dissatisfied, the companies will proceed to secure a review of the order in the circuit court of Cole county.\n No injunction to restrain the reduction shall be applied for; but, pending such review and until final determination of the case, the rates in force prior to the making of the order will be collected by the companies and they will 'give bond, conditioned and in such amount as the court may direct, to refund to the assured any excess of premiums collected by them if such order ... be finally sustained by decree or judgment of a court of last resort.' \n\n[281 U.S. 331, 335]\n\u00a0\n The question of the constitutionality of sections 6283 and 6284 will not be raised nor will the legality of the hearing provided for be questioned.\n October 9, 1922, the superintendent made the order that is the subject of this suit. It directed that, effective November 15, rates be reduced 10 per cent. November 10 plaintiff and other companies brought the matter before the court named in the stipulation for review. Upon the requirement of the court they executed a bond for the use of those to whom insurance policies might be issued by them prior to final decree. That court held the rates confiscatory and set aside the order. Its judgment was reversed in the state Supreme Court. AEtna Ins. Co. v. Hyde, 315 Mo. 113, 285 S. W. 65. The case was brought here and, January 3, 1928, was dismissed on the ground that no federal question was presented. AEtna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, \n275 \nU.S. 440\n, 48 S. Ct. 174.\n February 1, 1928, the superintendent designated the classes of risks to which the reduction should be applied, and thereupon this suit was commenced. The District Court found the stipulation valid and that under it plaintiff, and other companies in whose behalf it was made, had collected rates in excess of those prescribed and had failed to refund. On that ground the court denied plaintiff's application, but without prejudice to renewal after repayment.\n Plaintiff contends that the stipulation made in the earlier case by the attorneys for all the companies cannot operate against it in this case. The stipulation shows that when it was made another rate reduction was contemplated. All its provisions, except the one dismissing the review then pending, relate to procedure to be followed in making the reduction and for review. In lieu of the rule that during the pendency of the review insurers should not charge any rate in excess of those fixed \n\n[281 U.S. 331, 336]\n\u00a0\n by the superintendent (section 6284), it was arranged that the rates existing prior to the order should continue to be charged until final determination of the case. The companies were to give a bond to be fixed by the court to secure refund should the reduction finally be sustained. It is clear that the stipulation was intended to apply to the subsequent order and to any review of it.\n But plaintiff insists that the stipulation contains no promise to refund. The pertinent language is quoted above. The stipulation and order constituted the only basis of the companies' right to continue to collect the higher premiums. When read having regard to the circumstances and context, the quoted language reasonably may be construed to be a promise by each company to return to its policyholders the excess charges paid by them pending final determination of the validity of the reduction.\n Plaintiff claims that the superintendent failed to make the specified findings, and so relieved it from any obligation under the stipulation. An affidavit filed in support of its motion for temporary injunction states that the superintendent did not make these findings. The order is not in the record. The plaintiff failed to present the findings that were made. There is no showing that the companies produced the information called for by the superintendent or that he was not lawfully excused from making such findings. We may notice the record of that case in this court. \n1\n Aetna Ins. Co. v. Hyde, \n275 \nU.S. 440\n, 48 S. Ct. 174. The order is there \n\n[281 U.S. 331, 337]\n\u00a0\n fully set forth. It states that the companies refused to furnish the superintendent the necessary facts, and that accordingly such findings could not be made. Clearly plaintiff's showing is not sufficient to require the court to find that the superintendent was not excused by the companies' refusal to furnish information as agreed.\n Plaintiff contends that the collection of the higher rates was not made pursuant to the stipulation. It does not appear whether, in addition to prescribing the bond, the court authorized the collection of higher premiums until final determination of the validity of the reduction. The stipulation was sufficient to support such an order, and there is nothing in the record to require a finding that one was not made. See State ex rel. Hyde v. Westhues, 316 Mo. 457, 466, 290 S. W. 443. In view of the requirement of section 6284 that, pending review, insurers shall not charge more than the reduced rates, and in the absence of any other disclosed authority to continue to exact the higher premiums, it is right to attribute the excess charges to the promise to refund.\n Plaintiff lays much emphasis upon the fact that it will suffer irreparable loss if compelled to apply the lower rates during the litigation and the order is finally held unlawful, whereas, if the temporary injunction be granted, policyholders may be protected by an appropriate provision in the decree. Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n279 \nU.S. 813, 815\n, 49 S. Ct. 256. But, in respect of plaintiff's right to have a temporary injunction, its position is not as good as it would have been if this suit had been brought when the rate order was passed. As against the joint attack the reduction has been sustained by the court of last resort. Plaintiff has not repaid the policyholders. It now assails the statute as well as the order, and seeks again to prevent the taking effect of the prescribed rates. The retention of the higher premiums that it obtained by means of the stipulation and the denial of its promise to \n\n[281 U.S. 331, 338]\n\u00a0\n refund are facts properly to be considered. Courts of equity frequently decline to interfere on behalf of a complainant whose attitude is unconscientious in respect of the matter concerning which it seeks relief. Deweese v. Reinhard, \n165 \nU.S. 386, 390\n, 17 S. Ct. 340. While the rule which plaintiff invokes is one of general application, it cannot be said that the lower court erred in withholding relief until plaintiff makes good its promise to refund.\n Plaintiff contends that, as the companies failed to submit, and the superintendent, until February 1, 1928, did not designate the classes to which the reduction should be applied (section 6283), the lower rates did not take effect until that time. But by the stipulation the parties agreed that such order should apply to all classes alike. That was a sufficient designation in advance. And the promise to refund, the bringing of the suit to review the reduction, and the giving of the bond all support the view that, as to the companies making the stipulation, the rate reduction was then consummated. The court's imposition of the condition that excess premiums collected from November 15, 1922, be repaid is not without adequate support.\n A decree of the District Court denying an interlocutory injunction will not be reversed, unless shown to be contrary to some rule of equity or the result of an improvident exercise of judicial discretion. Meccano, Ltd., v. John Wanamaker, \n253 \nU.S. 136, 141\n, 40 S. Ct. 463; Chicago Great Western Ry. v. Kendall, \n266 \nU.S. 94, 100\n, 45 S. Ct. 55. Applying that rule, we find no adequate ground for reversal.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Butler v. Eaton, \n141 \nU.S. 240, 243\n, 11 S.

OF N.J.(1930)\nNo. 254\nArgued: November 25, 1929Decided: January 6, 1930\n\n\n\n Messrs. Thomas G. Haight, of Jersey City, N. J., and Frankland Briggs, of Newark, N. J., for appellant.[ New Jersey Bell Tel. Co. v. State Bd. of Taxes and A. of N.J. \n280 U.S. 338\n (1930) ]\n\n\n[280 U.S. 338, 340]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Duane E. Minard, of Newark, N. J., and William A. Stevens, of Red Bank, N. J., for appellee.\n\n\n[280 U.S. 338, 343]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1928 appellee made an assessment against the appellant under a law of New Jersey known as the Voorhees Franchise Tax Act. Appellant caused the assessment by writ of certiorari to be brought to the Supreme Court of the State, and there insisted that as construed the statute is repugnant to the commerce clause. That court held the law valid, sustained the tax, and dismissed the writ. (N. J. Sup.) 143 A. 841. And its judgment was affirmed in the Court of Errors and Appeals, 146 A. 915.\n As stated in its title, the act is one 'for the taxation of all the property and franchises of persons, copartnerships, associations or corporations (hereinafter referred to as taxpayers) using or occupying public streets, highways, roads or other public places ...' (hereinafter referred to as streets).1 Section 1 (P. L. 1900, p. 502, as amended by P. L. 1917, p. 43,  2) provides that 'all the property, real and personal, and franchises of' taxpayers who have the right to use or occupy streets shall be valued, assessed and taxed as provided in the act. Section 2 (P. L. 1900, p. 502) directs that the respective assessors 'shall each year ascertain the value of such property located in, upon or under any public street, ... in each taxing district, and the value of the property not so located; when so ascertained, all such property shall be assessed and taxed at local rates, as now provided by law. ...' And section 3 (P. L. 1900, p. 502, as amended by P. L. 1918, p. 907,  1) requires the valuation of all property located in streets to be reported by districts to county boards and by them to appellee. \n\n[280 U.S. 338, 344]\n\u00a0\n Section 4 (as amended by P. L. 1927, p. 567,  1) provides that all such taxpayers shall return each year to appellee a statement showing the gross receipts of their business in the state for the calendar year next preceding, and that 'the franchise tax of such person, copartnership, association or corporation for business so done in this State' shall be upon such proportion of gross receipts as the length of the line or mains in the streets bears to the length of the whole line or mains. Section 5 ( P. L. 1900, p. 503, as amended by P. L. 1917, p. 44,  4) prescribes the rate. It was 2 per cent. prior to the amendment of 1917, but that act increased it to 3 per cent. for 1918 to 4 per cent. for 1919 and to 5 per cent. for 1920 and each year thereafter.\n Section 6, as amended by P. L. 1927, p. 569,  2, requires appellee to apportion the franchise tax among the taxing districts on the basis of the locally assessed value of the taxpayer's property in the streets in each district to the total value of all its property so located. The amounts so apportioned are collected as are other taxes. Section 7 (P. L. 1900, p. 504) enacts that money paid to a tax district pursuant to contract shall be considered a payment on account of the franchise tax imposed by the act, and section 8 (P. L. 1900, p. 502, as amended by P. L. 1902, p. 476) declares that the franchise tax shall be in lieu of all other franchise taxes assessed against such taxpayers and their property.\n Appellant is a corporation organized under the laws of New Jersey and has long carried on a telephone business there. All its lines and property are within that state. October 1, 1927, it succeeded to the property and business in that state of the New York Telephone Company. A supplementary act approved March 27, 1928, required that company's gross receipts in New Jersey in 1927 to be included for the calculation of the franchise tax assessed against appellant. P. L. 1928, p. 223. Each company furnished intrastate telephone service in New Jersey, and also had large receipts for transmission of messages, passing over its lines in that state and other companies' connecting lines, between places in New Jer- \n\n[280 U.S. 338, 345]\n\u00a0\n sey and places in other states and countries. The service so rendered in New Jersey in respect of such interstate and foreign commerce is for brevity called interstate business. Appellant's telephone plant in New Jersey included large amounts of real and personal property which was assessed and taxed locally. The average of the local rates in 1918 was 3. 877 per cent. 2 The record does not disclose the assessed value of appellant's property.\n The gross receipts of both companies from business in New Jersey in 1927 was $40,280,332.95. Each received from its interstate business in that state between 23 and 24 per cent. of its total. The New York Telephone Company had 10,829 miles of line in New Jersey, of which 5,516 were in streets. And the appellant, after the acquisition of the property of the other company, had 15,203 miles, of which 8,403 were in streets. The franchise tax assessed in 1928, calculated as required by the act, amounted to $1,058,997.85. Appellant paid so much of the tax as was based on its intrastate earnings. The controversy in this case concerns only the 5 per cent. of gross receipts derived from interstate commerce.\n The Court of Errors and Appeals rested its decision on the reasons given by the Supreme Court. The latter declared itself bound to follow a former decision (Phillipsburg R. R. Co. v. State Bd. of Assessors, 82 N. J. Law, 49, 81 A. 1121) which, construing a like statute taxing street railways, held that the tax was not levied on gross receipts or business, but was 'merely an excise tax,' measured in part by gross earnings, on its franchise to exist as a corporation and its franchise to occupy the streets, and that it was not repugnant to the commerce clause. Dealing with the tax here involved, the court held it is a tax on property, 'earnings being taken merely as a measure of the value of the franchise of the prosecutor.'\n\n\n[280 U.S. 338, 346]\n\u00a0\n Appellant contends that the exaction is a license tax levied directly on gross receipts from interstate as well as intrastate commerce in addition to ad valorem taxes upon its real and personal property, and that therefore the act is repugnant to the commerce clause.\n Appellee insists that the franchise is intangible property which includes power of eminent domain, right to occupy the streets, going concern value, and the benefit of the state policy to have a regulated monopoly. It alludes to article 4,  7, par. 12, of the state Constitution: 'Property shall be assessed for taxes under general laws, and by uniform rules, according to its true value'; and argues that, by using gross receipts as a measure of value of the property right, a uniform system of taxation at a true value is attained; that the franchise tax is not upon business, commerce, or gross receipts as such.\n It is elementary that a state may tax property used to carry on interstate commerce. But, as the Constitution vests exclusively in the Congress power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, a state may not tax, burden, or interfere with such commerce or tax as such gross earnings derived therefrom or impose a license fee or other burden upon the occupation or the privilege of carrying on such commerce, whatever may be the instrumentalities or means employed to that end. Pullman Co. v. Richardson, \n261 \nU.S. 330, 338\n, 43 S. Ct. 366, 368, and cases cited. Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 165, 171\n, 48 S. Ct. 502, 62 A. L. R. 45. This tax cannot be sustained if it is not upon the property but is in fact a tax upon appellant's gross receipts from interstate and foreign commerce or a license fee to be computed thereon.\n The language of the act and the decisions of the courts of the state are to be given consideration in determining the actual operation and effect of the tax. But neither is necessarily decisive, for, whatever the terms used by \n\n[280 U.S. 338, 347]\n\u00a0\n the Legislature to impose the tax or by the courts in reference to it, the law cannot be sustained if it operates to burden or regulate interstate business. Galveston, Harrisburg, etc., Ry. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 227\n, 28 S. Ct. 638; Quaker City Cab Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n277 \nU.S. 389, 401\n, 48 S. Ct. 553; Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, \n279 \nU.S. 620, 625\n, 49 S. Ct. 432.\n The franchise tax upon gross earnings does not purport to be, and is not claimed as, a charge or rental for the use of property belonging to the state or any of its subdivisions. Indeed, the appellee insists, and rightly so, that the right to construct, maintain, and use mains and lines in streets is property owned by appellant; and it argues that the percentage of gross earnings exacted is a tax on that property right. Clearly the state, when passing the act making the assessment, acted, not as a proprietor demanding compensation for the use of its property, but as sovereign imposing a tax for the support of government. Cf. St. Louis v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n148 \nU.S. 92, 97\n, 13 S. Ct. 485.\n In the title and throughout the act the distinction is made between the tax on property and the franchise tax on gross receipts. The levying provision (section 5) defines the exaction as a 'franchise tax upon the annual gross receipts' and elsewhere in the act it is referred to briefly as 'franchise tax.' All real and personal property is required to be taxed by districts at local rates according to value; the franchise tax is a percentage of gross receipts; and it is declared to be in lieu, not of any property tax, but of all other franchise taxes.\n And, as under the state Constitution property is required to be assessed by uniform rules according to its true value, the Legislature may not reasonably be deemed to have intended direct valuation and assessment of some of the property at local rates and the measurement of the value of other elements of the plant by percentage of gross earnings increasing on a sliding scale from 2 per cent. in 1917 to 5 per cent. in 1920 and thereafter. North \n\n[280 U.S. 338, 348]\n\u00a0\n Jersey St. Ry. Co. v. Jersey City (Supreme Court) 73 N. J. Law, 481, 63 A. 833; (Court of Errors and Appeals) 74 N. J. Law, 761, 67 A. 33.\n While the ground on which the Supreme Court put its decision in this case does not clearly appear, it is certain that in a number of earlier decisions, the first of which was in 1906, the franchise tax upon gross earnings was held by the courts of the state to be a license fee tax and not a property tax. North Jersey St. Ry. Co. v. Jersey City, supra; Bergen Aqueduct Co. v. State Board, 95 N. J. Law, 486, 112 A. 881; Eastern Penna. Power Co. v. State Board, 103 N. J. Law, 281, 135 A. 677; and see Phillipsburg R. R. Co. v. State Bd. of Assessors, supra. There is no decision to the contrary, unless it is this case. Moreover, the preservation of the distinction between the tax on property and the franchise tax on gross receipts in amendatory acts passed after the highest court of the state held the latter to be a license fee strongly suggests that the Legislature intended the meaning of the act to be as construed.\n And the prescribed basis of apportionment of gross earnings is clearly inconsistent with the taxation according to its true value of appellant's right to use the street for its lines. The telephone property used to render the service from which the earnings are derived includes the lands, buildings, equipment, etc., as well as its lines; and material and labor for operation and maintenance are also required. The assumption underlying the prescribed rule is that, in respect of service and earnings per mile, mains and lines in streets are the same as, or fairly comparable with, the other mains and lines. But it is well known that one stretch of line may consist of only a pair of wires, while another stretch may carry many. The property in the streets was directly taxed by districts at $41, 189,804. Assuming, as appellee contends, that these assessments did not include the value of appellant's right to use streets, it would be without rational basis and \n\n[280 U.S. 338, 349]\n\u00a0\n arbitrary to use a mileage proportion of gross earnings to measure the value of the privilege or easement in question. And the amount of the franchise tax upon gross earnings was the equivalent of a tax at the average rate on property of value in excess of $27,000,000. That would assign to the naked right to use streets for telephone mains and lines more than $3,200 per mile. There has been called to our attention no precedent for the use of gross earnings as a measure of the value of a single element of such a plant. The elements of value resulting from appellant's power of eminent domain and possession of going concern and of a regulated monopoly cannot reasonably be deemed to be the sole or even a distinct source of the gross earnings by which the tax is measured. We think it very plain that the exaction is not a tax on property nor in substitution for or in lieu of a property tax. Within the rule heretofore applied in this Court, the exaction is a direct tax on gross receipts derived from appellant's interstate commerce, and, as to that part at least, is void. Phila. Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326, 336\n, 345 S., 7 S. Ct. 1118; Galveston, Harrisburg, etc., Ry. Co., supra, \n210 \nU.S. 217\n, 28 S. Ct. 638; Meyer v. Wells, Fargo & Co., \n223 \nU.S. 298\n, 32 S. Ct. 218; U. S. Express Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 \nU.S. 335\n, 32 S. Ct. 211; Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292, 295\n, 297 S., 38 S.

Richardson, supra.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n The appellant, a New Jersey corporation, has a part of its lines in and over New Jersey roads and other public places, and transmits over them messages to places both \n\n[280 U.S. 338, 350]\n\u00a0\n within the State and outside. For allowing this privilege the State charges a price in the form of a tax of five per cent. on such proportion of the gross receipts from all the work done in the State as the lines in the public places bear to the total lines in the State. There are no lines outside. The lines in public places are more than half the total lines. The interstate business is less than a third of the intrastate. I think the tax constitutional. I call it the price for a privilege, because that is what the Courts of the State pronounce it to be, North Jersey Street Ry. v. Jersey City, 73 N. J. Law, 481, 484, 63 A. 833, Id., 74 N. J. Law, 761, 763, 765, 67 A. 33, because on the statutes I think it plainly to be such, and because a statute must be assumed to rest on any and every ground that will support it, except so far as excluded by specific facts.\n What then is to hinder New Jersey from charging a reasonable price for something that the appellant cannot have without her consent? It is said that the hindrance lies in the fact that a part of the burden falls on interstate commerce. I am content to assume that if the State were attempting to discriminate against such commerce and using its right as a disguise, the attempt would fail. A right specifically protected by the Constitution may become a wrong when used to carry out an unlawful scheme. But there is nothing of that sort here. The tax is in lieu of all other taxes on intangible property, which the privilege is held to be in New Jersey. The reference to gross earnings to ascertain the value is legitimate. Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450\n, 38 S. Ct. 373. The proportion is prima facie reasonable, especially in view of the proportions between the lengths of the lines and between state and interstate business. It fairly may be supposed that the lines over the streets do their full share of the work. Furthermore the only objections to the tax raised in the record by the appellants are objections to the tax as a whole in so far as it may touch receipts from interstate \n\n[280 U.S. 338, 351]\n\u00a0\n business, not to the proportion adopted. And so I think that the incidence of a part of the tax on interstate commerce, if any such there be, 'does not constitute a direct and material burden' upon it. Hendrick v. Maryland, \n235 \nU.S. 610, 622\n, 35 S. Ct. 140; United States Express Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 \nU.S. 335\n, 32 S. Ct. 211.\n I do not think names of any importance to this case, and do not discuss whether the tax is to be called a property tax upon an easement, a franchise tax upon an incorporeal hereditament as it is called in New Jersey, a license tax, or by some other title. If the statute fixes a price for what the appellant needs the State's permission to use, I think it within New Jersey's constitutional power. 'Even interstate commerce must pay its way.' Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Richmond, \n249 \nU.S. 252, 259\n, 39 S. Ct. 265.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS agrees with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] P. L. 1900, p. 502, as amended by P.

CITY OF NEW ORLEANS(1930)\nNo. 460\nArgued: April 30, 1930Decided: June 2, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 682, 683]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Al C. Kammer and Charles Rosen, both of New Orleans, La ., for appellant.\n Messrs. Francis P. Burns and W. F. Conkerton, both of New Orleans, La ., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 682, 684]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented by this appeal is whether an ordinance of the city of New Orleans requiring the demolition of a viaduct and construction of grade crossings to take its place violates the contract clause of the Federal Constitution or the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Title 28 U. S. Code,  344(a), 28 USCA  344(A). King Mfg. Co. v. Augusta, \n277 \nU.S. 100\n, 48 S. Ct. 489.\n Appellant has a franchise granted by the city for the operation of a street railway system. One of its lines was constructed along Franklin avenue. That street intersects Florida Walk which is occupied by eight railroad tracks now used by the Southern Railway Company. March 9, 1910, the city passed Ordinance 6445. It recited that the railroad company objected to the street railway crossing its tracks at grade, that the public interest would best be served by a viaduct crossing, and that the street railway was willing to build one. It authorized the city engineer to approve plans for a viaduct to be constructed approximately on the center line of Franklin avenue and to embrace earthen embankment approaches that would not exceed the neutral space in Franklin avenue or obstruct the roadways on either side of it. Following the adoption of the ordinance, the company built a single-track trestle viaduct which has since been maintained and used for the passage of its street cars over the railroad tracks. November 7, 1926, the city passed Ordinance 9375 requiring appellant to remove the viaduct and to construct in its place double tracks at street level across the railroad tracks. Appellant refused and the city brought this suit to compel compliance.\n The complaint alleges: Because of increase of population, the single track is not sufficient to provide adequate service for the people of that section. The viaduct has \n\n[281 U.S. 682, 685]\n\u00a0\n not been properly maintained and is dangerous to the public. In order to eliminate to the public. where Franklin avenue intersects the railroad tracks of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company, it would be necessary to demolish the present viaduct and to construct across the tracks of both railroad companies a new viaduct for two street-railway tracks, two vehicular roadways, and two walks for pedestrians. The city would have to contribute one-half the cost of such construction (Act La. No. 38 of 1924), and it is not financially able to do so at the present time. The answer denies that the single-track viaduct is not sufficient to furnish adequate service or that it is unsafe. It avers: The ordinance required the construction of the viaduct; it cost approximately $58,000, and its purpose was to avoid having grade crossing over much used railroad tracks. New crossings are not necessary. They will cost more than $135,000 and subject users to hazards the viaduct was constructed to avoid. The ordinance is arbitrary and violates the contract clause of the Federal Constitution and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court, without making any specific findings of fact, entered a decree for the city; the Supreme Court affirmed. 168 La. 984, 123 So. 648.\n Appellant cites Grand Trunk Western Ry. v. South Bend, \n227 \nU.S. 544\n, 33 S. Ct. 303, 44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 405, and City of Owensboro v. Cumberland Telephone Co., \n230 \nU.S. 58\n, 33 S. Ct. 988, in each of which this court condemned a city ordinance as repugnant to the contract clause. In the former the ordinance attempted to repeal a valid grant of a right to use a street for a railroad purpose that was found not to be injurious to the public. In the latter the ordinance purported to require the telephone company to remove from city streets its poles and wires which had been placed there under authority granted by an earlier ordinance or to make payments not provided for in the contract under which the telephone lines were constructed. Neither of these cases has any \n\n[281 U.S. 682, 686]\n\u00a0\n application here. The ordinance now under consideration does not aim to destroy or to exact payment for the right of appellant to use the street for the operation of its street railway. It purports merely to regulate the use of the streets for the convenience and safety of the public. It does not impair appellant's franchise.\n The ordinance is presumed to be valid and the burden is upon the appellant to show that, having regard to the facts disclosed by the record, removal of the existing viaduct and construction of the crossings are so clearly unreasonable and arbitrary as to amount to the depriving of appellant of its property without due process of law. Aetna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, \n275 \nU.S. 440, 447\n, 448 S., 48 S. Ct. 174. Undoubtedly the city, acting as the arm of the state, has a wide discretion in determining what precautions in the public interest are necessary or appropriate under the circumstances. Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 217\n, 44 S. Ct. 15; Denver & R. G. R. Co. v. City and County of Denver, \n250 \nU.S. 241, 244\n, 39 S. Ct. 450. Regulations that are in principle fairly comparable to the ordinance under consideration have been sustained by this court as within the scope of the police power. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Ordinance 6445 merely authorized the street railway company so to use the streets. No element of coercion was involved. The opinion of the Supreme Court shows that one of the roadways has been narrowed by the city's construction of a sidewalk and, granting that the track is not presently inadequate, indicates that additional capacity for service at this intersection is likely to be needed. And, upon sufficient evidence, the court found that the viaduct is unsafe and that extensive repairs are required to put it in proper condition. \n\n[281 U.S. 682, 687]\n\u00a0\n The value of the viaduct to be removed, the large expenditure involved for construction of the crossings in its place, and the dangers incident to their use constitute the sole basis of fact on which the ordinance, is assailed. It is elementary that enforcement of uncompensated obedience to a regulation passed in the legitimate exertion of the police power is not a taking of property without due process of law. Chicago, Burlington & Q. Railroad Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 251\n, 17 S. Ct. 581; C., B. & Q. Railway Co. v. Illinois ex rel. Grimwood, \n200 \nU.S. 561, 594\n, 26 S. Ct. 341, 4 Ann. Cas. 1175; Chicago & Alton R. Co. v. Tranbarger, \n238 \nU.S. 67, 77\n, 35 S. Ct. 678. The sacrifice of the old structure and the cost of the new crossing involve a large amount of money. But the evidence fails to show that having regard to the circumstances, it is so large that the regulation must be held to pass the limits of reasonable judgment and amount to an infringement of the right of ownership. While the elimination of grade crossings is desirable in the interest of safety, there are other means that reasonable may be employed to safeguard against collisions at intersections of public streets and railroad tracks. Presumably the city will make and enforce appropriate regulations at this crossing. Appellant has failed to establish facts sufficient to require a finding that under conditions existing there it is not reasonably possible so to do. And it has not shown that the ordinance is so unreasonable that it transgresses constitutional limitations.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Denver & R. G. R. Co. v.

AMBROSE(1930)\nNo. 73\nArgued: January 10, 1930Decided: February 24, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 486, 487]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William H. Carey, Albert C. Wall, and John A. Hartpence, all of Jersey City, N. J., for petitioner.\n Messrs. A. O. Stanley, of Washington, D. C., and Alexander Simpson, of Jersey City, N. J., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) for the death of John Ambrose, as the result of an alleged negligent failure of the railroad company to furnish a safe place to work.\n Ambrose had been employed for many years in a grain elevator belonging to the company and used to facilitate the shipment of grain in interstate commerce. He worked on the 'bin floor,' which lies above a large number of grain bins, and with each of which it is connected by a circular opening, seventeen inches in diameter, furnished with a spout to carry the grain from the floor into the bin, and by a rectangular manhole, twenty by sixteen and three-quarter inches in size. These openings, when not in use, are closed with metal covers resting on flanges and sunk to a level with the floor.\n Ambrose's duties were to sweep the floor, help set the spouts, and generally to do such floor work as his foreman might direct. Sometimes grain became clogged so that it would not run out from the bin; in which event, one man would descend into the bin to clean it out, while another lowered and held a light in such position as to assist the former in the performance of his work. \n\n[280 U.S. 486, 488]\n\u00a0\n This work was rarely done and only upon an order from the foreman or superintendent.\n A short time prior to the accident, with the consent of the superintendent, a representative of a company not connected with the railroad was permitted to make an experiment in one of the bins for the extermination of weevil and other insects, which sometimes got into the grain. This experiment was conducted by mingling with the grain, as it moved through the bin, a powder, which generated a poisonous gas supposed to destroy the insects. In conducting the experiment, forty small bags containing weevil were dropped into the grain. After the experiment, one of the bags which had failed to come through was found lodged within the bin, but it was not intended or thought necessary to remove it. Ambrose was present when the foreman lowered a droplight into the bin and disclosed the bag, and was told by the foreman to keep away from the bin as much as possible, not to 'hang around' it, that the gas was poisonous.\n The following morning the only men at work on the floor were the foreman, Ambrose, and another employee. Both covers were in place, and Ambrose was engaged in sweeping the floor. The foreman went to another part of the premises, but, about twenty minutes later, hearing a noise 'like something hitting,' returned to the floor. He then found the covers of both openings off, and an electric droplight hanging through the spouthole into the bin. Looking down he saw Ambrose's body lying at the botton. There is no evidence to show how the covers were removed or the circumstances under which Ambrose entered the bin and so came to his death.\n The case was tried before a state circuit court, and the jury returned a verdict for the respondent, upon which there was a final judgment. Upon appeal to the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals, the judges were \n\n[280 U.S. 486, 489]\n\u00a0\n equally divided; and the judgment, because of that division, was affirmed ( 144 A. 584).\n We are of opinion that there must be a reversal because the evidence fails to establish negligence on the part of the railroad company. That the bin was a dangerous place does not admit of doubt. It contained a poisonous gas of the most deadly character. But of this Ambrose was informed. Not only was there no duty on his part to enter the bin, unless ordered to do so, but he had been specifically told of its dangerous character and warned to keep away as much as possible.\n It is said the jury could have found that a signal had been given to get the spouts ready, to which Ambrose responded; or that Ambrose found it necessary, within the scope of his employment while sweeping the floor, to adjust the covers of the openings, and in so doing was overcome by the gas and fell into the bin. But these are mere surmises, not legitimate inferences deducible from the proved facts. Considering the limited size of the openings, it is beyond reasonable belief that Ambrose could have fallen through either of them. In the absence of positive evidence to the contrary, the more rational conclusion is that he passed through the manhole by conscious and deliberate effort; and to that conclusion, the fact that the covers of both openings were off, with a droplight hanging through the smaller one, lends a noticeable degree of plausibility. True, in the face of the warning that the bin was dangerous and to keep away from it as much as possible, it is hard to find any good reason for such voluntary entrance on his part; but it is more difficult to account for the tragedy in any other way.\n In any view of the matter, the respondent (plaintiff), upon whom lay the burden, completely failed to prove that the accident was proximately due to the negligence of the company. It follows that the verdict rests only \n\n[280 U.S. 486, 490]\n\u00a0\n upon speculation and conjecture, and cannot be allowed to stand. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. v. Coogan, \n271 \nU.S. 472, 478\n, 46 S. Ct. 564, and cases cited.\n The utmost that can be said is that the accident may have resulted from any one of several causes, for some of which the company was responsible, and for some of which it was not. This is not enough. See Patton v. Texas & Pacific Railway Co., \n179 U.S. 658\n, at page 663, 21 S. Ct. 275, 277, where this court said:\n'The fact of accident carries with it no presumption of negligence on the part of the employer; and it is an affirmative fact for the injured employee to establish that the employer has been guilty of negligence. ... It is not sufficient for the employee to show that the employer may have been guilty of negligence; the evidence must point to the fact that he was. And where the testimony leaves the matter uncertain and shows that any one of half a dozen things may have brought about the injury, for some of which the employer is responsible and for some of which he is not, it is not for the jury to guess between these half a dozen causes and find that the negligence of the employer was the real cause, when there is no satisfactory foundation in the testimony for that conclusion. If the employee is unable to adduce sufficient evidence to show negligence on the part of the employer, it is only one of the many cases in which the plaintiff fails in his testimony; and no mere sympathy for the unfortunate victim of an accident justifies any departure from settled rules of proof resting upon all plaintiffs.'\n\n It is scarcely necessary to add that a recovery can not be predicated upon the theory that Ambrose, of his own accord, entered the bin. Whatever previously would have been the liability of the company, in virtue of the rule which requires the master to use reasonable care to furnish a safe place to work, there was no liability under that rule at the time of the accident, since, manifestly, \n\n[280 U.S. 486, 491]\n\u00a0\n the rule ceases to be operative whenever, and as long as, the place is closed against the servant, and he is authoritively may, of course, abandon or suspend its use, avoid it. The master who furnishes the place may, of course, abandon or suspend it use, whenever he discovers that it has ceased to be safe; and a servant, so notified and warned, who ignores the notice and warning, does so at his own risk.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK CENT R.

Owsley Stanley, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent, plaintiff below, brought suit in the circuit court of Hudson county, N. J., to recover under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59), for the death of his intestate. Judgment for plaintiff was affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey. 144 A. 635. This court granted certiorari October 21, 1929 (280 U. S. \n\n[281 U.S. 345, 347]\n\u00a0\n 540, 50 S. Ct. 27, 74 L. Ed. -), on a petition which asserted as ground sfor allowing the writ that the court below had erroneously decided that there was evidence that at the time of the accident deceased was engaged in interstate commerce; that there was evidence of negligence on the part of petitioner; and that deceased's death was not due to his own negligence.\n Decedent was employed in the roundhouse of petitioner at New Durham, N. J., in which there are thirty-two engine stalls, the doors to which are adjacent to and distant about 68 feet from a turntable. His duty was to fill the grease cups and pack the journal boxes of engines while in the roundhouse for inspection. On the night of the accident his hours of duty were from 7 p. m. to 3 a. m. He had worked on fourteen engines, using tools which were placed on an inspection wagon which was moved from engine to engine along a concrete runway extending in front of the engine stalls along the outer circumference of the roundhouse. He had lubricated and completed work on engine No. 3709 on track 8 before 11 o'clock in the evening. The last engine he worked on was No. 3835, standing on track 7, adjacent to track 8 on its left when facing the roundhouse. Fellow workmen, who had finished work on the same engine before the deceased, had been sent to do work outside the roundhouse. At about 2:15 a. m. deceased was instructed by his foreman or gang leader to work on engine 3835 and when finished to wait for the foreman at the inspection wagon, which was then located on the concrete runway in front of the open space lying between track 7 and track 8.\n There was no eyewitness to the accident. At about 2:34 a. m. the decedent's body, with head and one arm severed, was discovered on the right-hand rail of track 8, adjacent to track 9, underneath the trucks of the tender of engine No. 3709, which was then being backed on track 8 from the roundhouse to the turntable. His cap \n\n[281 U.S. 345, 348]\n\u00a0\n was found between the rails of track 8, about 15 feet outside of the door of the roundhouse. Blood stains were found on or near the right-hand rail of track 8, beginning about 30 feet from the roundhouse and extending to the point where the body was found, some 60 feet or more from the door of the roundhouse.\n The hostler who removed the engine from the roundhouse testified that before moving it he inspected track 8, that he saw no one on or near the track, that he then mounted the engine, started the air pump, turned on the headlight, rear light, and cab lights, started the engine bell ringing, and blew three blasts of the whistle as a warning that he was about to back the engine out and as notice to the operator of the turntable. At about 2:30 a. m., some ten minutes after mounting the engine, he backed the engine toward the turntable at the rate of about four miles an hour, looking behind as he did so. The operator of the turntable not responding to the signal, he stopped the engine, blew three more blasts, and when the turntable was set he again started the engine and proceeded until decedent's body was discovered.\n When backing the engine the tender cut off the view of the track for a distance of about 12 feet from its rear end. The clearance between engine No. 3709, which killed deceased, and the sides of the door to the roundhouse was about 4 inches, and between it and the engine on track 7 was variously estimated from about 2 feet to about 3 feet 9 inches. There was much evidence that there was constant blowing of whistles and ringing of bells in the roundhouse in connection with moving the engines and testing their whistles and bells. There was testimony by the hostler, confirmed by his foreman, that just before the movement of the engine in question the foreman cautioned him not to blow the whistle 'too loud' because of complaints and warnings by the local police on account of the noise coming from the roundhouse. \n\n[281 U.S. 345, 349]\n\u00a0\n Under all the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, it was a permissible inference by the jury that the sounding of whistle and bell, because of the continuous noise of whistles and bells which did not indicate movement of engines, was not sufficient warning that any particular engine was to be moved, and that in fact the signal given before moving the engine in question was insufficient for that purpose. In addition, there was testimony that there was a system or custom in the roundhouse of giving warning to the men employed about the engines when they were to be removed from the roundhouse, by posting the time of removal on a blackboard located on the inside of the outer wall of the roundhouse. The time posted for the engine in question was 3 a. m., or a half hour later than the actual time of its removal. There was evidence that the foreman had warned the hostler not to take the engine out 'too early.' There was also evidence tending to show that the time posted on the blackboard had no reference to the time of removal of the engine from the roundhouse, but merely indicated the time at which the engine must be ready for the engine crew on the apropriate siding in the yard beyond the turntable.\n But the inference to be drawn from this testimony as to the existence of the custom, its purpose, and the reliance which deceased under all the circumstances was entitled to place upon it, was for the jury. We think that there was sufficient evidence of petitioner's negligence to take the case to the jury. Workmen were constantly moving about the engines stalled in the roundhouse. Any movement of an engine without warning was dangerous to life and limb. After the hostler mounted the engine and before it was moved, sufficient time elapsed for the deceased to come into proximity with it which was dangerous if, as the jury might have found, he could not be seen from the engine cab by the \n\n[281 U.S. 345, 350]\n\u00a0\n hostler and was not warned of the impending movement. On the evidence it was for the jury to say whether petitioner exercised due care in moving the enging without a more specific and effective warning and whether failure to give it was the cause of the death.\n The jury, having found, as it might, that the negligence was the cause of the death, might also have inferred that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence, but the trial judge correctly charged that under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) contributory negligence is not a bar to recovery unless it is the sole cause of the injury or death, and may be taken into consideration by the jury in fixing the amount of damage.\n The engine, No. 3835, on which deceased last worked, was used in hauling interstate trains. It was not withdrawn from service. See Walsh v. N. Y., N. H. & H. R. R. Co., \n223 \nU.S. 1\n, 32 S. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44; Erie Railroad v. Szary, \n253 \nU.S. 86\n, 40 S. Ct. 454; cf. Industrial Accident Commission v. Davis, \n259 \nU.S. 182\n, 42 S. Ct. 489. But petitioner contends that deceased, having finished his work, was no longer employed in interstate commerce. The trial court submitted to the jury the question whether deceased had finished his work on this engine at the time of the accident, and there was some evidence to support a finding that he had not finished it. But if we assume that he had completed the work a few minutes before his death, he was still on duty. His presence on the premises was so closely associated with his employment in interstate commerce as to be an incident of it and to entitle him to the benefit of the Employers' Liability Act ( 45 USCA  51-59).

C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Providence R. I., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari, granted October 21, 1929, to review a judgment of the Court of Claims denying recovery of a part of petitioner's income and excess profits taxes for the year 1918, alleged to have been illegally exacted. 67 Ct. Cl. 693. Petitioner is a New Jersey corporation having an office and principal place of business in New York. It maintains a London branch, through which it paid the British government in 1918 income tax for the fiscal year April 6, 1917, to April 5, 1918, upon income received from sources in Great Britain in 1916 and earlier years, and based on a tax return made prior to 1918. Similarly, it paid in 1918 a tax for the year ending December 31, 1916, upon income and excess profits from sources within Great Britain. In making its tax return for the year 1918 petitioner deducted these payments from gross income. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue refused to allow the credit, and collected a correspondingly increased tax, which is the subject of the present suit.\n The applicable provision of section 238 of the Revenue Law of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, authorizes the deduction from the gross income of corporations, income and excess profits taxes 'paid' to foreign countries during the taxa- \n\n[281 U.S. 357, 359]\n\u00a0\n ble year. But section 200 defines the term 'paid' in section 238 as 'paid or accrued' or 'paid or incurred,' and provides that 'paid or accrued' shall be construed according to the method of accounting upon the basis of which the net income is computed under section 212. Section 212(b) requires that net taxable income shall be computed 'in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of such taxpayer; but if no such method of accounting has been so employed, or if the method employed does not clearly reflect the income, the computation shall be made upon such basis and in such manner as in the opinion of the Commissioner does clearly reflect the income.'\n Section 13(d) of the Revenue Act of 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, in force until the Act of 1918 became effective, provided that a corporate taxpayer 'keeping accounts upon any basis other than that of actual receipts and disbursements, unless such other basis does not clearly reflect its income, may, subject to regulations made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, make its return upon the basis upon which its accounts are kept, in which case the tax shall be computed upon its income as so returned.' Treasury Decision 2433 of January 8, 1917, interpreting this section, states: 'This ruling contemplates that income and authorized deductions should be computed and accounted for on the same basis,' and Income Tax Ruling, January-June, 1921, Cum. Bulletin No. 4, p. 147, provides: 'Section 13(d) of the Revenue Act of 1916 is a qualifying section and when accounts of a corporation are kept on a basis other than that of receipts and disbursements, it qualifies the manner of making deductions authorized in  12(a) of the Act, and the word 'paid' in the latter section is to be read 'paid or accrued,' depending on how the accounts of the corporation are kept.' \n\n[281 U.S. 357, 360]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Claims found that the books of the petitioner were kept on the accrual basis; that, while there were some exceptions of small items of deferred charges and credits and the expenses of the London office which were entered on its books only when paid or received, 'the principal and dominant purpose and plan of its accounts were to show income upon an accrual basis as the general and controlling character of the account.' It also found that the petitioner's return for 1918 was on the accrual basis, as were its tax returns for 1916, 1917, and 1919\n\n\n These findings are conclusive here. Luckenbach S. S. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 533, 538\n, 47 S. Ct. 186. Under them petitioner's liability for the tax collected must turn on the propriety of deducting the foreign tax payments from income for the year 1918, when paid, in order to arrive at the true income of the taxpayer. Under the 1916 act, where the taxpayer's books are kept and his returns made on the accrual basis, taxes charged on the books as they accrue must be deducted when accrued, if true income is thus reflected. United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422\n, 46 S. Ct. 131. Even if not so charged, it was competent for the Commissioner, under the Act of 1916, as well as under the express provisions of section 212(b) of the Act of 1918, to correct the taxpayer's return by deducting payments in the year in which they accrued so as to reflect true income by conforming to the dominating or controlling character of the taxpayer's system of accounts. United States v. American Can Co., \n280 \nU.S. 412\n, 50 S. Ct. 177, decided February 24, 1930. See United States v. Mitchell, \n271 \nU.S. 9, 12\n, 13 S., 46 S. Ct. 418.1 \n\n[281 U.S. 357, 361]\n\u00a0\n The findings do not disclose whether the foreign taxes paid in 1918 had accrued in that or in earlier years, or whether under the petitioner's system of bookkeeping their deduction in some earlier year was necessary in order to ascertain true income. But the presumption is that taxes paid are rightly collected upon assessments correctly made by the Commissioner, and in a suit to recover them the burden rests upon the taxpayer to prove all the facts necessary to establish the illegality of the collection. United States v. Anderson, supra; see United States v. Rindskopf, \n105 U.S. 418\n. In the absence of findings determining the fact, it cannot be assumed in petitioner's favor that the British taxes paid in 1918 did not accrue earlier, or that their deduction, if made in 1918, would reflect truly the income of the taxpayer whose books and tax return were on the accrual basis.\n Petitioner argues that, as its payments of foreign taxes were charged on its books in the year when paid, as were other expenses of the London branch, its return was made on the basis upon which its accounts were kept, and that under section 13d its tax should have been computed upon its income as so returned, if that method reflected true income. It is insisted that, in the absence of a finding to the contrary, this must be assumed, since the Commissioner made no readjustment of petitioner's account of the London office expenses, except the item of foreign taxes, and as it affirmatively appears in the findings that returns were made and accepted on the same basis as the \n\n[281 U.S. 357, 362]\n\u00a0\n 1918 return, for the tax years 1919 and 1924. But this argument likewise rests upon the assumption of facts which are without support in the findings; that the other expenses of the London office for 1918 and the foreign tax payments deducted in the 1919 and 1924 returns did not accrue in those years. If that assumption is made, failure of the Commissioner to correct the returns in these respects is as attributable to his error or oversight or lack of information as to any opinion on his part as to the propriety of the deductions in the years made.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Treasury Regulations 45 (1920 Ed.) promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1918 contained the following:\n'ART. 23.

CO.(1930)\nNo. 248\nArgued: February 28, 1930Decided: April 14, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 128, 129]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Sol Gelb and Humphrey J. Lynch, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Edward R. Brumley, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this action, brought in the District Court of the United States under the Federal Employer' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59), the complaint was dismissed upon the ground that \n\n[281 U.S. 128, 130]\n\u00a0\n the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act of March 4, 1927, was applicable and afforded an exclusive remedy. Chapter 509, 44 Stat. 1424, U. S. C. tit. 33,  901-950 (38 USCA  901-950). The judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 32 F.(2d) 179.\n The petitioner was injured on a car float of five hundred tons belonging to the defendant railroad company. The float was a vessel used in the transportation of railroad cars, and at the time of the injury was lying in navigable waters at Pier 42, East River, New York Harbor. The petitioner was employed by the railroad company as one of a gang of freight handlers in loading freight into cars on the float. He was using a hand truck in carrying a bale of paper, a piece of interstate freight, and, as the float was serveral feet lower than the dock, it was necessary to move the bale over a plank which ran from the dock to the middle of the float at a steep incline. Several men were assigned to help the petitioner in order to control the movement of the bale by handhooks. The petitioner was in front of the truck holding its handles, and alleged that, by the negligence of the other men, who failed to hold the bale properly, it got out of control and skidded down the plank, throwing the petitioner on the floor of the float and crushing his leg.\n The contention is that the car float was used as an adjunct to railroad transportation in interstate commerce, and that it was not the intention of Congress to substitute the remedy under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act for that afforded by the Federal Employers' Liability Act. The Circuit Court of Appeals assumed that the petitioner would have been entitled to prosecute his claim under the Federal Employers' Liability Act if the later act did not apply. If the latter was applicable, the remedy thereunder was made exclusive by \n\n[281 U.S. 128, 131]\n\u00a0\n the explicit provision of section 5, 44 Stat. p. 1426, U. S. C. tit. 33,  905 (33 USCA  905).1\n The general scheme of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act was to provide compensation to employees engaged in maritime employment, except as stated, for disability or death resulting from injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States where recovery through workmen's compensation proceedings might not validly be provided by state law. Employers are bound to secure the payment of the prescribed benefits to those of their employees whose employment is covered by the act, and this compensation is to be payable irrespective of fault as a cause of the injury.\n Employers are thus defined in section 2, subdivision (4), 44 Stat. 1425 (U. S. C. tit. 33,  902 (33 USCA  902)): 'The term 'employer' means an employer any of whose employees are employed in Maritime employment, in whole or in part, upon the navigable waters of the United States ( including any dry dock.)' The term is not defined otherwise, with respect either to the nature or the scope of \n\n[281 U.S. 128, 132]\n\u00a0\n the enterprises in which the employer is engaged. The definition is manifestly broad enough to embrace a railroad company, provided it has employees who 'are employed in maritime employment, in whole or in part, upon the navigable waters of the United States.'\n The employees subject to the act are not defined affirmatively, but section 2, subdivision (3), Id., contains the following limitation: 'The term 'employee' does not include a master of member of a crew of any vessel, nor any person engaged by the master to load or unload or repair any small vessel under eighteen tons net.' In this instance, the petitioner was not the master or member of the crew of the vessel, and the vessel was not under eighteen tons.\n The 'coverage' of the act is stated in section 3, subdivision (a), 44 Stat. 1426 (U. S. C. tit. 33,  903 (33 USCA  903)):\n's 903. (a) Compensation shall be payable under this chapter in respect of disability or death of an employee, but only if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock) and if recovery for the disability or death through workmen's compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law.'\n\n In Atlantic Transport Company v. Imbrovek, \n234 \nU.S. 52\n, 34 S. Ct. 733, 51 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1157, the libelant was engaged as a stevedore in loading a ship lying in port in navigable waters. The court had no doubt that he was performing a maritime service and that the rights and liabilities of the parties were matters within the admiralty jurisdiction. In Southern Pacific Company v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n, 37 S. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900, the Southern Pacific Company, a common carrier by Railroad in interstate commerce, also operated a steamship between New York and Galveston. Jensen, an employee of the company, was killed while he was engaged in unloading the ship which was berthed at a pier in the North River, New \n\n[281 U.S. 128, 133]\n\u00a0\n York harbor. He was operating a small electric freight truck which he drove out of the vessel upon a gang plank running to the pier. The Court of Appeals of New York (215 N. Y. 514, 109 N. E. 600, L. R. A. 1916A, 403, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 276), held that the Workmen's Compensation Act of the state applied to his employment and that the statute was not obnoxious to the Federal Constitution. In this court, two questions were presented, first, whether the Federal Employers' Liability Act was applicable and hence the state statute could not control; and, second, whether the Workmen's Compensation Act of the state conflicted with the general maritime law which constitutes an integral part of the federal law under article 3, section 2, of the Federal Constitution. Concluding that the case was not within the Federal Employers' Liability Act, as the ship could not properly be regarded as a part of the railroad's extension or equipment, the court took up the second question and decided that the New York Workmen's Compensation Act could not constitutionally govern the case of one injured upon navigable waters while engaged in maritime service. It was said that the state statute attempted to give a remedy unknown to the common law, incapable of enforcement by the ordinary proceedings of any court, and was not saved to suitors from the constitutional grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the federal District Courts.\n In State Industrial Commission v. Nordenholt Corporation, \n259 \nU.S. 263\n, 42 S. Ct. 473, 25 A. L. R. 1013, a longshoreman was injured on a dock while engaged in such a case, where the injury took that in such a case, where the injury took place on an extension of the land, the maritime law did not prescribe the liability, and the local law had always governed. The Workmen's Compensation Law of the state was accordingly held to be applicable. The distinction was thus maintained between injuries on land and those which were suffered by persons engaged in maritime employment on a vessel in navigable waters. \n\n[281 U.S. 128, 134]\n\u00a0\n From the standpoint of maritime employment, it obviously makes no difference whether the freight is placed in the hold or on the deck of a vessel, or whether the vessel is a car float or a steamship. A car float in navigable waters is subject to the maritime law like any other vessel. The injury caused to petitioner in this case is thus as much within the exclusive admiralty and maritime jurisdiction as was that of the employee in Southern Pacific Company v. Jensen, supra, and recovery for the injury 'through workmen's compensation proceedings' could not 'validly be provided by state law.'\n As the present case falls directly within the affirmative provisions of section 3 of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act ( 33 USCA  903), we look next to the case specially excepted. Section 3, after the provision quoted above, continues:\n No compensation shall be payable in respect of the disability or death of-\n'(1) A master or member of a crew of any vessel, nor any person engaged by the master to load or unload or repair any small vessel under eighteen tons net; or\n\n'(2) An officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof, or of any State or foreign government, or of any political subdivision thereof.'\n\n The case of the petitioner does not come within any of these exceptions. Their limited character is significant. No exception is made of the employees of a railroad company employed in maritime service on the navigable waters of the United States or with respect to the question whether such employment was in connection with an extension of railroad transportation. As to the master and crew of a vessel, it should be noted that section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act 1920 (chapter 250, 41 Stat. 988, 1007 (46 USCA  688)), gave to seamen the rights and remedies under all statutes of the United States which were applicable to railway employees in cases of personal injury, thus carry- \n\n[281 U.S. 128, 135]\n\u00a0\n ing to seamen the benefit of the provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act. Panama Railroad Company v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375\n, 44 S. Ct. 391; Engel v. Davenport, \n271 \nU.S. 33\n, 46 S. Ct. 410. Longshoremen engaged on a vessel at dock in navigable waters, in the work of loading or unloading, have been held to be seamen. International Stevedoring Company v. Haverty, \n272 \nU.S. 50\n, 47 S. Ct. 19. Northern Coal Company v. Strand, \n278 \nU.S. 142\n, 49 S. Ct. 88. But seamen, including longshoremen engaged in loading or unloading, if injured on a vessel in navigable waters, could not constitutionally have the benefit of a state workmen's compensation act, even if an act of Congress so provided. After the decision in Southern Pacific Company v. Jensen, supra, Congress amended clause 3 of section 24 and clause 3 of section 256 of the Judicial Code relating to cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, by adding to the clause saving to suitors commonlaw remedies the words, 'and to claimants the rights and remedies under the workmen's compensation law of any State.' Act of October 6, 1917, c. 97, 40 Stat. 395 (28 USCA  41(3), 371, cl. 3). In Knickerbocker Ice Company v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149\n, 40 S. Ct. 438, 11 A. L. R. 1145, this court held that the attempted amendment was unconstitutional as being an unwarranted delegation of the legislative power of Congress and as destroying the uniformity which the Constitution had established and thus defeating the constitutional grant of jurisdiction to the federal courts. By the act of June 10, 1922 (chapter 216, 42 Stat. 634), Congress again amended clause 3 of section 24 and clause 3 of section 256 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  41(3), 371, cl. 3 ). There was added to the saving clause the words, 'and to claimants for compensation for injuries to or death of persons other than the master or members of the crew of a vessel their rights and remedies under the workmen's compensation law of any State, District, Territory, or possession of the United States, which rights and remedies when conferred by such law shall be exclusive.' This court decided that the ex- \n\n[281 U.S. 128, 136]\n\u00a0\n ception of the master and crew of a vessel was insufficient to meet the objections which had been pointed out, and the amendment was held to be unconstitutional. Washington v. Dawson & Company, \n264 \nU.S. 219\n, 44 S. Ct. 302.\n When the bill which became the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act was pending in Congress, the importance of the policy of compensation acts, and their advantages in providing for appropriate compensation in the case of injury or death of employees, without regard to the fault of the employer, were distinctly recognized. It appears that the bill originally excluded a master or members of a crew of a vessel, but was amended so as to extend to them the benefits of compensation. House Rep. No. 1767, 69th Cong. 2d Sess. As these seamen preferred to remain outside of the provisions of the bill, they were finally excluded, and the bill was passed with the exceptions above-quoted. Cong. Rec. 69th Cong. 2d Sess. vol. 68, pt. 5, 5908. There was no exclusion of stevedores or of those sustaining injuries upon navigable waters in loading or unloading a vessel unless it was under eighteen tons net. The application of the act in such cases was explicitly made to depend upon the question whether the injury occurred upon navigable waters and recovery therefor could not validly be provided by a state compensation statute.\n The bill, as reported to, and first passed by, the Senate, contained a provision in section 3 excepting 'an employee of a common carrier by railroad engaged in interstate or foreign commerce or in commerce within any Territory or the District of Columbia if the injury from which the disability or death results occurred while the employee was employed in such commerce.' Sen. Rep. No. 973, 69th Cong. 1st Sess. This exception was eliminated from the bill as finally passed.\n It is hardly necessary to go further, as the clear and constitutional requirements of the act of Congress in the \n\n[281 U.S. 128, 137]\n\u00a0\n furtherance of the policy conceived to be in the interest of employees cannot be escaped by any permissible process of construction. For the opposing view it is said that repeals by implication are not favored. But it is not a case of resort to implication. The act expressly provides that liability thereunder 'shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer of the employee, his legal representative ... at law or in admiralty.' It is further provided that, if the employer in the case of the described employees engaged in maritime employment does not give the required compensation, the employee or his legal representative can maintain an action at law for damages, and, in such an action, not only are the defenses of contributory negligence and the negligence of a fellow servant excluded but also that of assumption of risk, a defense which is still open under the Federal Employers' Liability Act save in specified cases. Seaboard Air Line Railway v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492\n, 34 S. Ct. 635, L. R. A. 1915C, 1, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475; Pryor v. Williams, \n254 \nU.S. 43\n, 41 S. Ct. 36. Not only is the payment of compensation under the act bar to recovery at law but, if the compensation is not given, the remedy then available at law has its special incidents.\n Nor is there anything of substance added to the argument for the petitioner by reference to the possible effect on the application of other laws in cases which come within the purview of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, for the question still is, To what cases does that act apply according to its terms? The fact that the same employee of a railroad company may have different rights at different times is a familiar consequence of the application of different laws, as, for example, when the employee of a railroad company is engaged at one time in intrastate commerce and at another time, even on the same day, in interstate commerce; and the application of federal laws where the employment falls within the federal jurisdiction is manifestly \n\n[281 U.S. 128, 138]\n\u00a0\n a matter within the discretion of Congress. Panama Railroad Company v. Johnson, supra. In the present instance, had the petitioner been engaged in intrastate commerce, his case still would have been within the maritime jurisdiction of the federal courts, and he would have been denied the benefit of the state compensation law. See London Guarantee & Accident Company v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n279 \nU.S. 109\n, 49 S. Ct. 296. In these circumstances Congress dealt with the maritime employment of longshoremen whose injuries sustained on navigable waters would fall within the exclusive maritime jurisdiction, without regard to the distinction between intrastate and interstate transportation.\n It is also pointed out that in the Act of May 17, 1928 (chapter 612, 45 Stat. 600 (33 USCA  901, note)), applying the provisions of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act to employees in the District of Columbia, a special exception was added of the case of an employee of a common carrier by railroad when engaged in interstate or foreign commerce or commerce solely within the District of Columbia. The fact that a similar exception was left out of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act and was inserted in the later statute works against, rather than for, the petitioner's contention.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 5 provides: 'The liability of an employer prescribed in section 904 ... shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee, his legal representative, husband or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin, and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury or death, except that if an employer fails to secure payment of compensation as required by this chapter, an injured employee, or his legal representative in case death results from the injury, may elect to claim compensation under this chapter, or to maintain an action at law or in admiralty for damages on account of such injury or death. In such action the defendant may not plead as a defense that the injury was caused by the negligence of a fellow servant, nor that the employee assumed the risk of his employment, nor that the injury was due to the contributory negligence of the employee.' \n\n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOHIO OIL CO. v. CONWAY(1930)\nNo. 440\nArgued: March 4, 1930Decided: April 14, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 146, 147]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Sidney L.

Guion, of New Orleans, La., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Ohio Oil Company brought this suit in the District Court to enjoin the enforcement of a statute of Louisiana (Act No. 5 of 1928) imposing a severance tax upon the production of oil. The statute as applied to the complainant was attacked as a violation both of the constitution of Louisiana and of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. It was alleged that the laws of the State afforded no remedy for the recovery of taxes illegally exacted. On appeal from an order denying an interlocutory injunction, this court decided that the questions presented could not be resolved satisfactorily upon the affidavits submitted, and directed that an injunction should be granted pendente lite on stated terms. \n279 \nU.S. 813\n, 49 S. Ct. 256. Trial was had before the District Court, as specially constituted under the applicable statute, and a decree was entered dismissing the bill. 34 F.(2d) 47. The complaint appeals.\n In the year 1921, the Constitution of Louisiana was amended so as to provide that natural resources severed from the soil or water might be classified for the purpose of taxation and that taxes might be 'predicated upon \n\n[281 U.S. 146, 151]\n\u00a0\n either the quantity or value of the product at the time and place where it is severed.' Const. art. 10,  21.1 By Act No. 140 of 1922,  2, natural resources were divided into two classes, and taxes were levied on oil and gas at 3 per cent. of the gross market value of the total production, and on all other natural resources at 2 per cent. of the gross market value. The Supreme Court of Louisiana, sustaining this tax on oil and natural gas, held that it was not a property tax but was an excise tax upon the privilege of severing, although it was measured by the value of the property severed. This decision was affirmed here. Gulf Refining Co. v. McFarland, 154 La. 251, 97 So. 433; Id., \n264 \nU.S. 573\n, 44 S. Ct. 402.\n In 1928, the Legislature of Louisiana enacted the statute now in question which amended the prior act so as to tax various natural resources on the basis of the quantity severed. Under this amendment taxes on oil were classified according to gravity and ran from 4 cents a barrel of 42 gallons on oil of 28 degrees gravity and below, to 11 cents a barrel on oil above 43 degrees gravity. Act 5 of 1928.2 \n\n[281 U.S. 146, 152]\n\u00a0\n The business of the complainant in Louisiana is that of producing and selling oil and not of refining it. The production of the complainant is in the following fields: Haynesville, in the parish of Claiborne; Cotton Valley, in the parish of Webster; Pine Island, in the parish of Caddo; Urania, in the parish of La Salle. All these fields are in North Louisiana. The bulk of the complainant's production is in the Haynesville, Cotton Valley, and Pine Island fields. Its production in these fields from January to June, 1928, inclusive, amounted to 723,192 barrels out of its total production in Louisiana of 762,139 barrels; and from August, 1928, to March, 1929, inclusive, to 690,397 barrels out of its total production of 705,301 barrels; the remainder was Urania production.\n'Gravity' as used in the statute, and in oil price quotations, is not specific gravity, but what is called Baume gravity, under which the lighter the oil the higher the gravity. The record shows that, generally speaking, crude petroleums are divided into three classes-paraffine base, asphalt base, and mixed base, the last being a combination of paraffine and asphalt base. The higher gravity oils usually have a paraffine base, while the lower gravity oils usually have an asphalt base. All three of these classes are found in Louisiana. In North Louisiana \n\n[281 U.S. 146, 153]\n\u00a0\n there are paraffine base, asphalt base, and mixed base crudes, the oils generally having paraffine base, while in South Louisiana the oil produced is mostly asphalt base.\n\n The process of refining oil is distillation. The evidence is that paraffine base oil in that manner yields gasoline, kerosene, gas oil, some lubricating oil, and wax. Gasoline comes off first and is the most valuable component of such oil. Asphalt base oil usually yields a very small amount of gasoline by distillation, the first product ordinarily being gas oil, then lubricating oil, and the residuum, asphalt. The gas oil may be subjected to the cracking process and gasoline may be obtained in that way. The value of asphalt base oil is largely for the manufacture of lubricating oil, and the value for this purpose is determined by viscosity and sulphur content, not by gravity. The coastal oils of South Louisiana are divided into 'A' and 'B' grades, 'Grade A' being the oils that are useful in the production of lubricating oil, and the other oil being classed as 'Grade B.' While gravity is not the determining factor, it appears from the testimony that 'Grade A' oils must be less than 25 degrees gravity.\n Asphalt base oils are produced in North Louisiana in the fields of Pine Island, Urania, Hosston, and Bellevue. The last three named are suitable for making lubricating oil, but the Pine Island heavy oil does not have that value. The evidence is that the Urania, Hosston, and Bellevue oils, used for that purpose, are practically the same as the coastal 'Grade A' oils.\n Gravity is said to be an index of relative value of oils only in the same pool or district, and oils of different gravity are produced in the same fields and from the same tracks of land and sometimes from the same sand. But it appears that, with respect to paraffine base oils, the higher the gravity, the greater is the gasoline content \n\n[281 U.S. 146, 154]\n\u00a0\n which as between these oils is largely determinative of price. Gravity in such cases is a rough and familiar method of approximating the gasoline content, and in many fields price quotations of crude oil above 28 degrees are graduated according to gravity.\n Crude oil as it comes from the wells is run into tanks from which the purchaser sells to pipe lines, the well-recognized market prices being the prices posted by the pipe line companies buying the oil. The complainant states that the oil produced in its Haynesville field was from 33 to 36 degrees gravity; in its Cotton Valley field, one class was between 28 and 31 degrees gravity and another above 43 degrees gravity; in its Pipe Island field, its production was from 37 to 41 degrees gravity. The complainant purchased no crude oil except that, in the Haynesville field, it bought some of the royalty oil of the lessors under its leases. The complainant's cashier testified at the trial that complainant's 'purchases and sales in each field in which it operates are made on a gravity basis.'\n This testimony is not understood to include the Urania field in which the complainant was not operating at the time but had been operating until shortly before. The oil from the Urania field, which was about 20 degrees gravity as well as that of the Bellevue and Hosston fields in North Louisiana, and the 'Grade A' coastal oils of South Louisiana, were sold at a flat price and not by gravity. 'Grade B' oil, it was testified, was usually sold on a gravity schedule.\n In 1928, the production of oil in Louisiana was about 22,000,000 barrels, of which approximately two-thirds was produced in North Louisiana, and of this amount nearly two-thirds was sold on a gravity basis, and the remainder at a flat price.

The respondent states that the oils of these Louisiana fields are shipped to a common market, Port Arthur, Tex., and, by reason of the greater distance, the transportation charges for the oils of North Louisiana are\n[157-Continued.]\n\n TABLE CONTINUED\n Gray County Carson and Wheeler (Texas) (Texas Hutchinson Salt Creek, Grade B & Light Somerset (South Panhandle) Panhandle) (Texas Panhandle) Wyo.

It manifestly is a specific tax at a rate per barrel of 42 gallons, and not strictly ad valorem. The graduation of the tax according to the gravity of the oil does not make it other than a tax according to quantity, that is, per barrel, as the oils of different classes are treated for the purpose of the tax as being in effect different commodities, each of which has its separate tax. We have not been referred to any decision of the state court upon the point and, until that court pronounces otherwise, we see no reason to hold that the tax is unauthorized by the State.\n The further argument is made that the classification of oils is unreasonable and hence is not permitted by the State Constitution. This is substantially the same question, from the standpoint of state authority, that is presented as a Federal ground of attack under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The complainant contends that the statute of Louisiana, imposing a tax according to gravity, operates as an arbitrary discrimination; that is, discriminates in a wholly unjustifiable manner between the oils of the North Louisiana and South Louisiana fields, and also between the fields producing asphalt base oils. The tax on its production in the Haynesville, Cotton Valley, and Pine Island fields is said to be at a rate from about 6 to 7 1\/2 per cent. of its value; and on the production in the Urania field, at about 5 1\/3 per cent. of the value; while on the production in fields in South Louisiana, and in the Bellevue field, in North Louisiana, the tax is between 3 and 3 1\/2 per cent. of the value. \n\n[281 U.S. 146, 159]\n\u00a0\n The applicable principles are familiar. The States have a wide discretion in the imposition of taxes. When dealing with their proper domestic concerns, and not trenching upon the prerogatives of the national government or violating the guarantees of the Federal Constitution, the States have the attribute of sovereign powers in devising their fiscal systems to insure revenue and foster their local interests. The States, in the exercise of their taxing power, as with respect to the exertion of other powers, are subject to the requirements of the due process and the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, but that Amendment imposes no iron rule of equality, prohibiting the flexibility and variety that are appropriate to schemes of taxation. The State may tax real and personal property in a different manner. It may grant exemptions. The State is not limited to ad valorem taxation. It may impose different specific taxes upon different trades and professions and may vary the rates of excise upon various products. In levying such taxes, the State is not required to resort to close distinctions or to maintain a precise, scientific uniformity with reference to composition, use, or value. To hold otherwise would be to subject the essential taxing power of the State to an intolerable supervision, hostile to the basic principles of our government and wholly beyond the protection which the general clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to assure.

R. 1454. \n\n[281 U.S. 146, 160]\n\u00a0\n With all this freedom of action, there is a point beyond which the State cannot go without violating the equal protection clause. The State may classify broadly the subjects of taxation, but in doing so it must proceed upon a rational basis. The State is not at liberty to resort to a classification that is palpably arbitrary. The rule is generally stated to be that the classification 'must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.' Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, \n253 \nU.S. 412, 415\n, 40 S. Ct. 560, 561; Louisville Gas Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 37\n, 48 S. Ct. 423; Air-Way Corporation v.

R. 1224\n\n\n In the present instance it is apparent that a classification according to gravity cannot be regarded as palpably arbitrary. While the Baume gravity of oils may vary, even in the same fields, it has been used by the oil industry as indicating in a general way, apparently satisfactory for practical purposes, the gasoline content. In laying a specific severance tax per barrel, the State was not compelled to make an exact determination of the composition of each oil produced. At least with respect to oils sold primarily for the gasoline they contained, it cannot be said that the State attempted a hostile and unjustifiable discrimination in graduating its tax according to gravity, when the industry itself resorted to the factor of gravity in fixing the scale of prices for such oils. Further, the complainant is in no position to contest the action of the State in adopting a gravity basis with respect to the production of its oils in the Haynesville, Cotton Valley, and Pine Island fields, which constituted over 90 per cent. of its entire production, as the complainant itself sold these oils on a gravity basis. If it be granted, as we think it must be, that the State could adjust the severance tax with respect to such oils according to gravity, the \n\n[281 U.S. 146, 161]\n\u00a0\n question comes simply to that of the particular graduation of the tax. There are, it is true, various gravity schedules of prices, and the same fields may produce oils of different gravities, and oils broadly of the same sort may be sold at flat prices; but, if the State was at liberty to adopt a gravity scale for oils which in such large measure were sold on this basis, the State was not required to grade its tax with a nicety which would assign to every oil produced a grade absolutely corresponding to its actual value. That would mean that the State could tax only on a strictly ad valorem basis, a contention wholly inadmissible. In grading a tax, admittedly within its power to levy, the State had a large discretion and there appears to be no ground for holding that there was such an abuse in this instance as to create constitutional invalidity. Clark v. Titusville, \n184 \nU.S. 329, 331\n, 22 S. Ct. 382. The graduation of the tax on these oils corresponded generally to the supposed increase of gasoline content, and all oils of the same gravity were treated alike.\n The question raised by the complainant has particular bearing upon the discrimination with respect to oils under 28 degrees gravity. The complainant in this respect must stand on its own case. Its oil of this sort is its Urania production, and that oil, as well as that of the Bellevue field in North Louisiana, is said to be 'practically the same' as the coastal 'Grade A' oils of South Louisiana. According to complainant's own showing, these oils are especially suited to the manufacture of lubricating oil and are dealt in with that in view. While in such cases gravity is not the criterion, but rather viscosity and sulphur content, these are oils of relatively low gravity, that is, under 28 degrees, and the Louisiana severance tax is a uniform one of four cents a barrel. As these last-mentioned oils had a distinct composition and a different utility, the State could impose a tax upon them which was different from that imposed upon the other oils pro- \n\n[281 U.S. 146, 162]\n\u00a0\n duced by the complainant and not so well suited for the making of lubricating oil. The State might have concluded not to tax the former at all, and in that case there would have been no constitutional ground of complaint because a tax was laid on the different oils of the Haynesville, Cotton Valley, and Pine Island fields. In Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., supra, complaint was made of a statute of Pennsylvania because it levied a tax on anthracite coal and not on bituminous coal. The contention was founded on the fact that both were fuels and that anthracite coal in steam sizes competed with bituminous coal and certain sub-grades of the latter competed with certain subgrades of anthracite. The Court, accepting the fact of competition, nevertheless sustained the tax, holding that the differences between the two sorts of coal justified that classification. If the State had described the oils especially suitable for the manufacture of lubricating oil with respect to their composition or use, and had taxed them at four cents a barrel, it could not be said that the statute was beyond the power of the State to enact simply because it subjected the complainant to a different tax on its oils of a different character. The statute is not made invalid by reason of a failure to describe the oils scientifically.\n The question is thus reduced to the discrimination alleged with respect to the tax on the complainant's Urania production as compared with similar oils. As all these oils bear the same tax of 4 cents a barrel, the complainant manifestly has no ground for complaint on this score unless it can be found in differences in the prices of these oils. Urania oil was sold at 75 cents a barrel, while 'Grade A' oil brought $1.20 a barrel. The record affords no explanation of the reason for this wide spread in the price of oils, said to be practically the same and used for the same purpose, unless it be the one advanced by the respondent that the difference is due to the \n\n[281 U.S. 146, 163]\n\u00a0\n distance of the fields from the common market and the consequent difference in transportation charges. Whether or not this is an adequate explanation, it cannot be said that the State, from the standpoint of the Federal Constitution, could not put the same specific severance tax on the same sort of oils used in the same way, merely because particular producers of such oils might obtain different prices. There may be many reasons why one owner obtains more in gross return for the same sort of commodities than another owner, and still other reasons why the net returns of the one may be more than those of the other. This court recently decided that a tax imposed by Alabama on those selling cigars and cigarettes, which was based on the 'wholesale sales price' was not repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment because of an alleged difference in the wholesale prices paid by dealers who bought from the manufacturers and by those who did not. Exchange Drug Company v. Long, \n281 \nU.S. 693\n, 50 S. Ct. 244, 74 L. Ed. -, decided March 12, 1930. A classification of threaters for license fees according to prices of admission was held to be valid, although some of the theaters charging the higher admission, and paying the higher tax, had the less revenue. Metropolis Theatre Co. v. Chicago, \n228 \nU.S. 61\n, 33 S. Ct. 441. We find no ground for holding that the tax in this instance violated the Federal Constitution.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 21 is as follows: 'Texas may be levied on natural resources severed from the soil or water to be paid proportionately by the owners thereof at the time of severance.

S. CO. v. VARGAS(1930)\nNo. 425\nArgued: Decided: June 2, 1930\n\n\n\n Mr. Thomas A. Thacher, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. H. W. Hutton, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in admiralty brought in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of California against a company owning and operating an American steamship as a common carrier, between ports \n\n[281 U.S. 670, 671]\n\u00a0\n Central America and the port of San Francisco, to recover damages for an alleged assault constituting rape committed by an employee of the ship on a young woman while being carried thereon as a passenger. The plaintiff was given a decree, which the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, 33 F.(2d) 894; and the case is here on certiorari.\n The District Court delivered no opinion and made no findings of fact other than such as may be implied from the decree. The Circuit Court of Appeals described the evidence as conflicting, the plaintiff's case as not free from suspicion, and the defense as weak; and it then affirmed the decree on the stated ground that appellate courts refuse to review decisions of trial courts based on conflicting testimony taken before them, unless the record discloses some plain error of fact or some misapplication of the law.\n Thus we have a case in which the evidence is conflicting-pronouncedly so according to the argument in this court-and in which there has been no distinct finding of the facts by the court primarily charged with their determination. No doubt a finding of some kind is to be implied from the decree-a finding that would suffice as against a collateral attack. But the present attack is direct, not collateral. It is made in an appellate proceeding where the review, unlike that on a writ of error at law, extends to the findings of fact as well as to the rulings on questions of law. The decree does not show on what premise of fact or law it was given, but only that it was given on some premise which in the court's opinion entitled the plaintiff to the decree. The court may have regarded the evidence as showing seduction rather than rape, and may have given the decree on the theory that the defendant was equally liable in either case. In the absence of distinct findings, an appellate court cannot know how the questions of fact were resolved. The situation is much like that described in the following extract \n\n[281 U.S. 670, 672]\n\u00a0\n from Lawson v. United States Mining Co., \n207 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 28 S. Ct. 15, 18:\n'It is insisted that the findings of the Circuit Court should have bound and concluded the Court of Appeals upon questions of fact. The difficulty with this contention is that there is nothing to show what the Circuit Court found to be the facts. Whatever might have been suggested by the course of the argument at the hearing, the comments of the court upon such argument, or in announcing its decision, there is nothing in the record to indicate whether its decision was based upon a question of fact of a matter of law. The record only contains its decree, dismissing the bill. All else is a matter of surmise, except as may be inferred from the allegations of the pleadings and the scope of the testimony. While it is apparent that the Circuit Court must have based its decision upon one of two or three grounds, yet upon which it is not certain.'\n\n And see The City of New York (C. C. A.) 54 F. 181.\n Formerly it was the general practice in suits in admiralty to make distinct findings on the issues of fact; and, while that practice placed an added duty on trial judges, it was attended with undoubted advantages, in that it made for greater precision in the disposal of such suits in the trial courts and facilitated the presentation and consideration of appeals from decrees therein.\n In the present case we think the situation requires that the decrees in both courts below be vacated and the case remanded to the District Court, with a direction to make specific findings of fact and to take such further proceedings as may be in conformity with law.\n If the judge who presided at the trial and rendered the decree is prepared to make such findings without a further trial, that course may be taken; otherwise the case should be retried.\n Decrees vacated, and cause remanded for further proceeding in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","98":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPARAMOUNT FAMOUS LASKY CORPORATION v.

Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n[282 U.S. 30, 36]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By this proceeding the United States seek to prevent further violation of section 1, Act of Congress approved July 2, 1890 (Sherman Anti-Trust Act) c. 647, 26 Stat. 209 (15 USCA  1), through an alleged combination and conspiracy to restrain interstate commerce in motion picture films.\n Appellants are the Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation and nine other corporations (distributors) producers and distributors throughout the Union of 60 per cent. of the films used for displaying motion pictures by some 25,000 theater owners (exhibitors), the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, a corporation with class B membership composed of the above-mentioned distributors, and thirty-two film boards of trade, which severally function within certain defined regions.\n Each distributor produces and then distributes films through its own exchanges, maintained in thirty-two centrally located cities-Albany, Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, etc. Each of these exchanges has a manager, and under his supervision contracts are made for the use of \n\n[282 U.S. 30, 37]\n\u00a0\n his distributor's films within the designated territory or region and thereafter placed in the hands of the exhibitors. Other distributors, who with appellants control 98 per cent. of the entire business, also have managers with like duties in the same cities. In each region all of these managers are associated through and constitute the entire membership of the local film board of trade.\n Under the common practice, in the spring, when most of the pictures are still only in contemplation, each distributor announces its intended program of distribution for twelve months. After this announcement, exhibitors are solicited to enter into written contracts for permission to display such of the pictures as they desire; and, as no distributor can offer enough pictures to supply the average exhibitor's full requirement, he must deal with several.\n Under an agreement amongst themselves, appellant distributors will only contract with exhibitors according to the terms of the standard exhibition contract, dated May 1, 1928. Ordinarily, neither party gives security for compliance with such agreements, by cash deposit or otherwise.\n This standard contract is an elaborate document, covering eight pages of the record. Under it the distributor licenses the exhibitor to display specified photoplays at a designated theater on definite dates. Provision is made for cash payment three days in advance of any shipment, time and place of delivery, return of the prints, etc. Section 18 (copied in the margin)1 provides, in substance, that each party shall submit any controversy that may \n\n[282 U.S. 30, 38]\n\u00a0\n arise to a board of arbitration, in the city where the distributor's exchange is located, established under and controlled by written rules adopted May 1, 1928, accept as conclusive the findings of this board, and forego the right to trial by jury. And further:\n'In the event that the Exhibitor shall fail or refuse to consent to submit to arbitration any claim or controversy arising under this or any other Standard Exhibition Con- \n\n[282 U.S. 30, 39]\n\u00a0\n tract which the Exhibitor may have with the Distributor or any other distributor or to abide by and forthwith comply with any decision or award of such Board of Arbitration upon any such claim or controversy so submitted, the Distributor may, at its option, demand, for its protection and as security for the performance by the Exhibitor of this and all other existing contracts between the parties hereto, payment by the Exhibitor of an additional sum not exceeding $500 under each existing contract, such sum to \n\n[282 U.S. 30, 40]\n\u00a0\n be retained by the Distributor until the complete performance of all such contracts and then applied, at the option of the Distributor, against any sums finally due or against any damages determined by said Board of Arbitration to be due to the Distributor, the balance, if any to be returned to the Exhibitor; and in the event of the Exhibitor's failure to pay such additional sum within seven (7) days after demand, the Distributor may by written notice to the Exhibitor suspend service hereunder until said sum shall be paid and\/or terminate this contract.'\n\n The rules of arbitration provide for a board, three of whom shall be members of the local film board of trade and three proprietors or managers of theaters in its region. This arbitration board shall have power to determine the controversy, make findings, direct what shall be done with respect to the dispute; 'and shall fix the maximum amount,' not exceeding $ 500, which each distributor may demand as security pursuant to the arbitration clause in the event of the failure of the exhibitor to submit to arbitration or to comply with the award. The secretary of the board of arbitration is required to notify the secretary of the film board of trade of the name and address of each exhibitor found to have refused to arbitrate or comply with an award, and the maximum amount of security, not above $500, found by the board. 'On receipt of any such notice, each member having a contract (or representing a distributor having a contract) containing the arbitration clause with any such exhibitor shall demand payment by such exhibitor of such sum as in the judgment of such member or distributor shall be sufficient to protect such member of distributor in the performance of each contract with such exhibitor. Said sum shall not exceed the actual value of any print thereafter to be delivered under each such contract plus the maximum amount fixed by the Board of Arbitration as \n\n[282 U.S. 30, 41]\n\u00a0\n aforesaid. Thereafter each distributor (represented in the membership) to whom such exhibitor shall have failed within seven (7) days to pay the amount of security so demanded by such distributor shall proceed to suspend service under each such contract until such exhibitor shall have furnished such security or complied with the decision of such Arbitration Board. If service under any such contract shall be so suspended for a period of ten days such contract, at the option of the distributor, may then be cancelled. No member or distributor having so suspended service under any such contract with such exhibitor shall thereafter resume service under any such contract unless and until such exhibitor shall have furnished said security to such member or distributor or shall have complied with the decision of the Arbitration Board. Upon the happening of either of such events service under such contract shall be promptly resumed by such member or distributor.'\n The record discloses that ten competitors in interstate commerce, controlling 60 per cent. of the entire film business, have agreed to restrict their liberty of action by refusing to contract for display of pictures except upon a standard form, which provides for compulsory joint action by them in respect of dealings with one who fails to observe such a contract with any distributor, all with the manifest purpose to coerce the exhibitor and limit the freedom of trade.\n The United States maintain that the necessary and inevitable tendency of the outlined agreement and combination, described with greater detail in the opinion below, is to produce material and unreasonable restraint of interstate commerce in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  1-7, 15). Eastern States Lumber Ass'n v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 600, 614\n, 34 S. Ct. 951, L. R. A. 1915A, 788; Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, \n263 \nU.S. 291, 312\n, 44 S. Ct. 96. The court below accepted this view, and directed an ap- \n\n[282 U.S. 30, 42]\n\u00a0\n propriate injunction against future action under the unlawful plan. We agree with its conclusion, and the challenged decree must be affirmed.\n The appellants claim: (1) The standard exhibition contract and rules of arbitration, dated May 1, 1928, having been evolved after six years of discussion and experimentation, are reasonable and normal regulations; so that whatever restraint follows falls short of unlawful coercion. (2) Arbitration is well adapted to the needs of the motion picture industry. ( 3) The manner in which the contract and rules have worked out in practice, and the significant absence of complaints, reflect their reasonable character. (4) The decree is inconsistent with the stipulated facts, also with the court's findings of fact.\n'Founded upon broad conceptions of public policy, the prohibitions of the statute (Sherman Act) were enacted to prevent not the mere injury to an individual which would arise from the doing of the prohibited acts, but the harm to the general public which would be occasioned by the evils which it was contemplated would be prevented, and hence not only the prohibitions of the statute, but the remedies which it provided, were coextensive with such conceptions.' Wilder Mfg. Co. v. Corn Products Co., \n236 \nU.S. 165, 174\n, 35 S. Ct. 398, 401. 'The purpose of the Sherman Act is to prohibit monopolies, contracts and combinations which probably would unduly interfere with the free exercise of their rights by those engaged, or who wish to engage, in trade and commerce-in a word to preserve the right of freedom to trade.' United States v. Colgate & Co., \n250 \nU.S. 300, 307\n, 39 S. Ct. 465, 468, 7 A. L. R. 443. 'The fundamental purpose of the Sherman Act was to secure equality of opportunity and to protect the public against evils commonly incident to destruction of competition through monopolies and combinations in restraint of trade.' Ramsay Co. v. Associated Bill Posters of U. S. and Canada, \n260 \nU.S. 501, 512\n, 43 S. Ct. 167, 168. 'The Sherman Act was in- \n\n[282 U.S. 30, 43]\n\u00a0\n tended to secure equality of opportunity, and to protect the public against evils commonly incident to monopolies, and those abnormal contracts and combinations which tend directly to suppress the conflict for advantage called competition-the play of the contending forces ordinarily engendered by an honest desire for gain.' United States v. American Oil Co., \n262 \nU.S. 371, 388\n, 43 S. Ct. 607, 611\n\n\n\n The fact that the standard exhibition contract and rules of arbitration were evolved after six years of discussion and experimentation does not show that they were either normal or reasonable regulations. That the arrangement existing between the parties cannot be classed among 'those normal and usual agreements in aid of trade and commerce' spoken of in Eastern States Lumber Ass'n v. United States, supra, page 612 of 234 U. S., 34 S. Ct. 951, 954, is manifest. Certainly it is unusual, and we think it necessarily and directly tends to destroy 'the kind of competition to which the public has long looked for protection.' United States v. American Oil Co., supra, page 390 of 262 U. S., 43 S. Ct. 607, 611.\n The Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  1-7, 15) seeks to protect the public against evils commonly incident to the unreasonable destruction of competition, and no length of discussion or experimentation amongst parties to a combination which produces the inhibited result can give validity to their action. Congress has so legislated 'as to prevent resort to practices which unduly restrain competition or unduly obstruct the free flow of such commerce, and private choice of means must yield to the national authority thus exerted.' Eastern States Lumber Ass'n v. United States, supra, page 613 of 234 U. S., 34 S. Ct. 951, 954.\n It may be that arbitration is well adapted to the needs of the motion picture industry; but, when under the guise of arbitration parties enter into unusual arrangements which unreasonably suppress normal competition, their action becomes illegal. \n\n[282 U.S. 30, 44]\n\u00a0\n In order to establish violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, it is not necessary to show that the challenged arrangement suppresses all competition between the parties or that the parties themselves are discontented with the arrangement. The interest of the public in the preservation of competition is the primary consideration. The prohibitions of the statute cannot 'be evaded by good motives. The law is its own measure of right and wrong, of what it permits, or forbids, and the judgment of the courts cannot be set up against it in a supposed accommodation of its policy with the good intention of parties, and, it may be, of some good results.' Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20, 49\n, 33 S. Ct. 9, 15.\n Upon examination of the record, we cannot say that the decree of the court below is inconsistent with the stipulated facts or with proper regard to what that court held in respect of the facts.\n The challenged decree must be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Eighteenth. The parties hereto agree that before either of them shall resort to any court to determine, enforce or protect the legal rights of either hereunder, each shall submit to the Board of Arbitration ( established or constituted pursuant to the Rules of Arbitration filed with the American Arbitration Association, 342 Madison Avenue, New York City, bearing date May 1, 1928 and identified by the sig \n natures of the Contract Committee appointed at the 1927 Motion Picture Trade Practice Conference, a copy of which will be furnished to the Exhibitor upon request in the city wherein is situated the exchange of the Distributor from which the Exhibitor is served or if there be no such Board of Arbitration in such city then to the Board of Arbitration in the city nearest thereto (unless the parties hereto agree in writing that such submission shall be made to a Board of Arbitration located in another specified city), all claims and controversies arising hereunder for determination pursuant to the said Rules of Arbitration and the rules of procedure and practice adopted by such Board of Arbitration.\n The parties hereto further agree to abide by and forthwith comply with any decision and award of such Board of Arbitration in any such arbitration proceeding, and agree and consent that any such decision or award shall be enforceable in or by any court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the laws of such jurisdiction now or hereafter in force; and each party hereto hereby waives the right of trial by jury upon any issue arising under this contract, and agrees to accept as conclusive the findings of fact made by any such Board of Arbitration, and consents to the introduction of such findings in evidence in any judicial proceeding.\n In the event that the Exhibitor shall fail or refuse to consent to submit to arbitration any claim or controversy arising under this or any other Standard Exhibition Contract which the Exhibitor may have with the Distributor or any other distributor or to abide by and forthwith comply with any decision or award of such Board of Arbitration upon any such claim or controversy so submitted, the Distributor may, at its option, demand, for its protection and as security for the performance by the Exhibitor of this and all other existing contracts between the parties hereto, payment by the Exhibitor of an additional sum not exceeding $500 under each existing contract, such sum to be retained by the Distributor until the complete performance \n of all such contracts and then applied, at the option of the Distributor, against any sums finally due or against any damages determined by said Board of Arbitration to be due to the Distributor, the balance, if any to be returned to the Exhibitor; and in the event of the Exhibitor's failure to pay such additional sum within seven (7) days after demand, the Distributor may by written notice to the Exhibitor suspend service hereunder until said sum shall be paid and\/or terminate this contract.\n In the event that the Distributor shall fail or refuse to consent to the submission to arbitration of any claim or controversy arising under this or any other Standard Exhibition Contract providing for arbitration which the Distributor may have with the Exhibitor, or to abide by and forthwith comply with any decision or award of such Board of Arbitration upon any such claim or controversy so submitted, within the number of days specified in Article Twenty-Second opposite the name of the City in which such Board of Arbitration is located, the Exhibitor may at his option terminate this and any other existing contract between the Exhibitor and the Distributor by mailing notice by registered mail within two (2) weeks after such failure or refusal, and in addition the Distributor shall not be entitled to redress from such Board of Arbitration upon any claim or claims against any exhibitor until the Distributor shall have complied with such decision, and in the meanwhile the provisions of the first paragraph of this Article Eighteenth shall not apply to any such claim or claims.\n Any such termination by either party, however, shall be without prejudice to any other right or remedy which the party so terminating may have by reason of any such breach of contract by the other party.\n The provisions of this contract relating to arbitration shall be construed according to the law of the State of New York. \n\n\n\n\n","99":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPATTON v. U.S.(1930)\nNo. 53\nArgued: February 25, 1930Decided: April 14, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 276, 277]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Claude Nowlin and J. R. Spielman, both of Oklahoma City, Okl., for Patton and others.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 276, 278]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles E. Hughes, Jr. Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 276, 286]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The defendants (plaintiffs in error) were indicted in a federal District Court, charged with conspiring to bribe a federal prohibition agent, a crime punishable by imprisonment in a federal penitentiary for a term of year. A jury of twelve men was duly impaneled. The trial began on October 19, 1927, and continued before the jury of twelve until October 26 following, at which time one of the jurors, because of severe illness, became unable to serve further as a juror. Thereupon it was stipulated in open court by the government and counsel for defendants, defendants personally assenting thereto, that the trial should proceed with the remaining eleven jurors. To this stipulation the court consented after stating that the defendants and the government both were entitled to a constitutional jury of twelve, and that the absence of one juror would result in a mistrial unless both sides should waive all objections and agree to a trial before the remaining eleven jurors. Following this statement, the stipulation was renewed in open court by all parties. During the colloquy counsel for defendants stated that he had personally conferred with all counsel and with each of the defendants individually, and it was the desire of all to finish the trial of the case with the eleven jurors \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 287]\n\u00a0\n if the defendants could waive the presence of the twelfth juror.\n The trial was concluded on the following day, and a verdict of guilty was rendered by the eleven jurors. Each of the defendants was sentenced to terms of imprisonmen in the penitentiary on the several counts of the indictment. An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals upon the ground that the defendants had no power to waive their constitutional right to a trial by a jury of twelve persons.\n The court below (30 F.(2d) 1015, 1018), being in doubt as to the law applicable to the situation thus presented, and desiring the instruction of this court, has certified the following question:\n'After the commencement of a trial in a federal court before a jury of twelve men upon an indictment charging a crime, punishment for which may involve a penitentiary sentence, if one juror becomes incapacitated and unable to further proceed with his work as a juror, can defendant or defendants and the government through its official representative in charge of the case consent to the trial proceeding to a finality with 11 jurors, and can defendant or defendants thus waive the right to a trial and verdict by a constitutional jury of 12 men?'\n\n The question thus submitted is one of great importance, in respect of which there are differences of opinion among the various lower federal and state courts; but which this court thus far has not been required definitely to answer. There are, however, statements in some of our former opinions, which, if followed, would require a negative answer. These are referred to and relied upon by the defendants.\n The federal Constitution contains two provisions relating to the subject. Article 3,  2, cl. 3, provides:\n\n\n[281 U.S. 276, 288]\n\u00a0\n 'The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.'\n The Sixth Amendment provides:\n'In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining Witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.'\n\n Passing for later consideration the question whether these provisions, although varying in language, should receive the same interpretation, and whether taken together or separately the effect is to guarantee a right or establish a tribunal as an indispensable part of the government structure, we first inquire what is embraced by the phrase 'trial by jury.' That it means a trial by jury as understood and applied at common law, and includes all the essential elements as they were recognized in this country and England when the Constitution was adopted, is not open to question. Those elements were: (1) That the jury should consist of twelve men, neither more nor less; (2) that the trial should be in the presence and under the superintendence of a judge having power to instruct them as to the law and advise them in respect of the facts; and (3) that the verdict should be unanimous.\n As to the first of these requisites, it is enough to cite Thompson v. Utah, \n170 \nU.S. 343, 350\n, 18 S. Ct. 620, 622, where this court \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 289]\n\u00a0\n reversed the conviction of a defendant charged with grand larceny by a jury of eight men, saying:\n'It must consequently be taken that the word 'jury' and the words 'trial by jury' were placed in the constitution of the United States with reference to the meaning affixed to them in the law as it was in this country and in England at the time of the adoption of that instrument; and that when Thompson committed the offence of grand larceny in the territory of Utah-which was under the complete jurisdiction of the United States for all purposes of government and legislation-the supreme law of the land required that he should be tried by a jury composed of not less than twelve persons.'\n\n The second requisite was expressly dealt with in Capital Traction Company v. Hof, \n174 U.S. 1\n, 13-16, 19 S. Ct. 580, 585, where it is said:\n\"Trial by jury,' in the primary and usual sense of the term at the common law and in the American constitutions, is not merely a trial by a jury of 12 men before an officer vested with authority to cause them to be summoned and impaneled, to administer oaths to them and to the constable in charge, and to enter judgment and issue execution on their verdict; but it is a trial by a jury of 12 men in the presence and under the superintendence of a judge empowered to instruct them on the law and to advise them on the facts, and (except on acquittal of a criminal charge) to set aside their verdict, if, in his opinion, it is against the law or the evidence. This proposition has been so generally admitted, and so seldom contested, that there has been little occasion for its distinct assertion.'\n\n The third requisite was held essential in American Publishing Company v. Fisher, \n166 \nU.S. 464, 468\n, 17 S. Ct. 618, 619; Springville v. Thomas, \n166 \nU.S. 707\n, 17 S. Ct. 717, 41 L. Ed, 1172; Maxwell v. Dow, \n176 \nU.S. 581, 586\n, 20 S. Ct. 494. \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 290]\n\u00a0\n These common law elements are embedded in the constitutional provisions above quoted, and are beyond the authority of the legislative department to destroy or abridge. What was said by Mr. Justice Brewer in American Publishing Company v. Fisher, supra, with respect to the requirement of unanimity, is applicable to the other elements as well:\n'Whatever may be true as to legislation which changes any mere details of a jury trial, it is clear that a statute which destroys this substantial and essential feature thereof is one abridging the right.'\n\n Any such attempt is vain and ineffectual, whatever form it may take. See In re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564, 594\n, 15 S. Ct. 900\n\n\n The foregoing principles, while not furnishing a precise basis for an answer to the question here presented, have the useful effect of disclosing the nature and scope of the problem, since they demonstrate the unassailable integrity of the establishment of trial by jury in all its parts, and make clear that a destruction of one of the essential elements has the effect of abridging the right in contravention of the Constitution. It follows that we must reject in limine the distinction sought to be made between the effect of a complete waiver of a jury and consent to be tried by a less number than twelve, and must treat both forms of waiver as in substance amounting to the same thing. In other words, an affirmative answer to the question certified logically requires the conclusion that a person charged with a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term of years may, consistently with the constitutional provisions already quoted, waive trial by a jury of twelve and consent to a trial by any lesser number, or by the court without a jury.\n We are not unmindful of the decisions of some of the state courts holding that it is competent for the defendant to waive the continued presence of a single juror who has become unable to serve, while at the same time deny- \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 291]\n\u00a0\n ing or doubting the validity of a waiver of a considerable number of jurors, or of a jury altogether. See, for example, State v. Kaufman, 51 Iowa, 578, 580, 2 N. W. 275, 33 Am. Rep. 148, with which compare State v. Williams, 195 Iowa, 374, 191 N. W. 790; Commonwealth ex rel. Ross v. Egan, 281 Pa. 251, 256, 126 A. 488, with which compare Commonwealth v. Hall, 291 Pa. 341, 140 A. 626, 58 A. L. R. 1023. But in none of these cases are we able to find any persuasive ground for the distinction.\n Other state courts, with, we think, better reason, have adopted a contrary view. In State v. Baer, 103 Ohio St. 585, 134 N. E. 786, a person charged with manslaughter had been convicted by eleven jurors. The trial began with a jury of twelve, but, one of the jurors becoming incapable of service, the trial was concluded with the remaining eleven. In disposing of the case, the state Supreme Court thought it necessary to consider the broad question (page 589 of 103 Ohio St., 134 N. E. 786, 788): '... Whether the right of trial by jury, as guaranteed by sections 5 and 10 of the Bill of Rights, can be waived.' After an extensive review of the authorities and a discussion of the question on principle, the court concluded that, since it was permissible for an accused person to plead guilty and thus waive any trial, to must necessarily be able to waive a jury trial.\n In Jennings v. State, 134 Wis. 307, 309, 114 N. W. 492, 14 L. R. A. ( N. S.) 862, where, again, a juror during the trial was excused from service because of illness, and the case was continued and concluded before the remaining eleven, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin also disposed of the case as involving the power of the defendant to waive a jury altogether, saying:\n'It seems necessarily to follow that if a person on trial in a criminal case has no power to waive a jury he has no right to be tried by a less number than a common-law jury of 12, and when he puts himself on the county it requires a jury of 12 to comply with the demands of the Constitution. The fact that the jury in \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 292]\n\u00a0\n the instant case had the required number of 12 up to the stage in the trial when the cause was to be submitted to them under the instructions of the court cannot operate to satisfy the constitutional demand. At this point the trial was incomplete; for the very essential duty of having the jury deliberate upon the evidence and agree upon a verdict respecting defendant's guilt or innocence remained unperformed. Without the verdict of a jury of 12 it cannot be said to be a verdict of the jury required by the Constitution. Such a verdict is illegal and insufficient to support a judgment.'\n\n We deem it unnecessary to cite other cases which deal with the problem from the same point of view.\n A constitutional jury means twelve men as though that number had been specifically named; and it follows that, when reduced to eleven, it ceases to be such a jury quite as effectively as though the number had been reduced to a single person. This conclusion seems self evident, and no attempt has been made to overthrow it save by what amounts to little more than a suggestion that by reducing the number of the jury to eleven or ten the infraction of the Constitution is slight, and the courts may be trusted to see that the process of reduction shall not be unduly extended. But the constitutional question cannot thus be settled by the simple process of ascertaining that the infraction assailed is unimportant when compared with similar, but more serious infractions which might be conceived. To uphold the voluntary reduction of a jury from twelve to eleven upon the ground that the reduction-though it destroys the jury of the Constitution-is only a slight reduction, is not to interpret that instrument, but to disregard it. It is not our province to measure the extent to which the Constitution has been contravened and ignore the violation, if, in our opinion, it is not, relatively, as bad as it might have been. \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 293]\n\u00a0\n We come, then, to the crucial inquiry: Is the effect of the constitutional provisions in respect of trial by jury to establish a tribunal as a part of the frame of government, or only to guarantee to the accused the right to such a trial? If the former, the question certified by the lower court must, without more, be answered in the negative.\n Defendants strongly rely upon the language of this court in Thompson v. Utah, supra, at page 353 of 170 U. S., 18 S. Ct. 620, 624:\n'It is said that the accused did not object, until after verdict, to a trial jury composed of eight persons, and therefore he should not be heard to say that his trial by such a jury was in violation of his constitutional rights. It is sufficient to say that it was not in the power of one accused of felony, by consent expressly given or by his silence, to authorize a jury of only eight persons to pass upon the question of his guilt. The law in force when this crime was committed did not permit any tribunal to deprive him of his liberty, except one constituted of a court and a jury of twelve persons.'\n\n But this statement, though positive in form, is not authoritative. The case involved the validity of a statute dispensing with the common-law jury of twelve, and providing for trial by a jury of eight. There was no contention that the defendant Thompson had consented to the trial, but only that he had not objected until after verdict. The effect of an express consent on his part to a trial by a jury of eight was not involved- indeed he had been silent only under constraint of the statute-and what the court said in respect of that matter is, obviously, an obiter dictum.\n Defendants also cite as supporting their contention two decisions of federal Circuit Courts of Appeal, namely, Low v. United States (C. C. A.) 169 F. 86, 92; and Dickinson v. United States (C. C. A.) 159 F. 801. \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 294]\n\u00a0\n In the first of these cases the opinion, rendered by Judge Lurton, afterwards a justice of this court, definitely holds that the waiver of trial of a crime by jury involves setting aside the tribunal constituted by law for that purpose and the substitution by consent of one unknown to the law, and that this cannot be done by consent of the accused and the district attorney. 'Undoubtedly,' the opinion concludes, 'the accused has a right to waive everything which pertains to form and much which is of the structure of a trial. But he may not waive that which concerns both himself and the public, nor any matter which involves fundamentally the jurisdiction of the court. The jurisdiction of the court to pronounce a judgment or conviction for crime, when there has been a plea of not guilty, rests upon the foundation of a verdict by a jury. Without that basis the judgment is void.' This is strong language from a judge whose opinion is entitled to great respect.\n In the second case, involving the completion of a trial by consent with a jury of eleven persons, substantially the same was held; but in a scholarly and thoughtful dissenting opinion, Judge Aldrich reviews the common-law practice upon the subject antedating the Constitution, and in the course of his opinion, after referring to article 3,  2, and the Sixth Amendment, says pages 813-814, 820-821 of 159 F.):\n'The aim of the constitutional safeguards in question is a full, fair, and public trial, and one which shall reasonably and in all substantial ways safeguard the interests of the state and the life and liberty of accused parties. Whether the idea is expressed in words or not, as is done in some of the bills of rights and constitutions, a free and fair trial only means a trial as free and fair as the lot of humanity will admit.\n\n'All will doubtless agree, at least the unquestioned authority is that way, that these protective provisions of \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 295]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution are not so imperative that an accused shall be tried by jury when he desires to plead guilty; or that his trial, in the event of trial, shall be held invalid for want of due process of law, based upon the ground that he was not confronted with his witnesses when he had waived that constitutional right and consented to the use of depositions; or because he had not had compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor when he had waived that; or because he had not had the assistance of counsel when he had intelligently refused such constitutional privilege and insisted upon the right to go to trial without counsel; or upon the ground that he had not had a speedy trial when he had petitioned the court for delay; or that his trial was not public when he had consented to, or silently acquiesced in, a trial in a courthouse with a capacity of holding only 12 members of the public rather than 1200.\n\n'Beyond question, the right of an accused in a case like this to have 12 jurors throughout is so far absolute as a constitutional right that he may have it by claiming it, or even by withholding consent to proceed without that number, and doubtless, under a constitutional government like ours, the interests of the community so far enter into any incidental departure from that number, in the course of the trial, as to require the discretionary approval of the court, and that the proper representative of the government should join the accused in consent. ...\n\n'It is probable that the history and debates of the constitutional convention will not be found to sustain the idea that the constitutional safeguards in question were in any sense established as something necessary to protect the state or the community from the supposed danger that accused parties would waive away the interest which the government has in their liberties, and go to jail.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 276, 296]\n\u00a0\n 'There is not now, and never was, any practical danger of that. Such a theory, at least in its application to modern American conditions, is based more upon useless fiction than upon reason. And when the idea of giving countenance to the right of waiver, as something necessary to a reasonable protection of the rights and liberties of accused, and as something intended to be practical and useful in the administration of the rights of the parties, has been characterized, as involving innovation 'highly dangerous,' it would, as said by Judge Seevers in State v. Kaufman, 51 Iowa, 578, 581, 2 N. W. 275, 277, 33 Am. Rep. 148, 'have been much more convincing and satisfactory if we had been informed why it would be highly dangerous.' ...\n'Traced to its English origin, it would probably be found, so far as the right of waiver was there withheld from accused parties, that in a very large sense the reason for it was that conviction of crime, under the old English system, operated to outlaw and to attaint the blood and to work a forfeiture of official titles of inheritance, thus affecting the rights of third parties.\n\n'In every substantial sense our constitutional provisions in respect to jury trials in criminal cases are for the protection of the interests of the accused, and as such they may, in a limited and guarded measure, be waived by the party sought to be benefited.'\n\n The record of English and colonial jurisprudence antedating the Constitution will be searched in vain for evidence that trial by jury in criminal cases was regarded as a part of the structure of government, as distinguished from a right or privilege of the accused. On the contrary, it uniformly was regarded as a valuable privilege bestowed upon the person accused of crime for the purpose of safeguarding him against the oppressive power of the King and the arbitrary or partial judgment of the \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 297]\n\u00a0\n court. Thus, Blackstone, who held trial by jury both in civil and criminal cases in such esteem that he called it 'the glory of the English law,' nevertheless looked upon it as a 'privilege,' albeit 'the most transcendent privilege which any subject can enjoy.' Book III, p. 379. And Judge Story, writing at a time when the adoption of the Constitution was still in the memory of men then living, speaking of trial by jury in criminal cases, said:\n'When our more immediate ancestors removed to America, they brought this great privilege with them, as their birthright and inheritance, as a part of that admirable common law which had fenced round and interposed barriers on every side against the approaches of arbitrary power. It is now incorporated into all our State constitutions as a fundamental right, and the Constitution of the United States would have been justly obnoxious to the most conclusive objection if it has not recognized and confirmed it in the most solemn terms.' 2 Story on the Constitution,  1779.\n\n In the light of the foregoing it is reasonable to conclude that the framers of the Constitution simply were intent upon preserving the right of trial by jury primarily for the protection of the accused. If not, and their intention went beyond this and included the purpose of establishing the jury for the trial of crimes as an integral and inseparable part of the court, instead of one of its instrumentalities, it is strange that nothing to that effect appears in contemporaneous literature or in any of the debates or innumerable discussions of the time. This is all the more remarkable when we recall the minute scrutiny to which every provision of the proposed Constitution was subjected. The reasonable inference is that the concern of the framers of the Constitution was to make clear that the right of trial by jury should remain inviolable, to which end no language was deemed too imperative. That this was the purpose of the third article is rendered \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 298]\n\u00a0\n highly probable by a consideration of the form of expression used in the Sixth Amendment:\n'In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury. ...'\n\n This provision, which deals with trial by jury clearly in terms of privilege, although occurring later than that in respect of jury trials contained in the original Constitution, is not to be regarded as modifying or altering the earlier provision; and there is no reason for thinking such was within its purpose. The first ten amendments and the original Constitution were substantially contemporaneous and should be construed in pari materia. So construed, the latter provision fairly may be regarded as reflecting the meaning of the former. In other words, the two provisions mean substantially the same thing; and this is the effect of the holding of this court in Callan v. Wilson, \n127 \nU.S. 540, 549\n, 8 S. Ct. 1301, 1303, where it is said:\n'And we do not think that the amendment was intended to supplant that part of the third article which relates to trial by jury. There is no necessary conflict between them.'\n\n Upon this view of the constitutional provisions we conclude that article 3,  2, is not jurisdictional, but was meant to confer a right upon the accused which he may forego at his election. To deny his power to do so is to convert a privilege into an imperative requirement.\n But the question remains whether the court is empowered to try the case without a jury; that is to say, whether Congress has vested jurisdiction to that end. We think it has, although some of the state, as well as some of the federal, decisions suggest a different conclusion.\n By the Constitution, art. 3,  1, the judicial power of the United States is vested in the Supreme Court and such inferior courts as Congress may from time to \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 299]\n\u00a0\n time ordain and establish. In pursuance of that authority, Congress, at an early day, established the District and Circuit Courts, and by section 24 of the Judicial Code (U. S. Code, tit. 28,  41(2), 28 USCA  41(2), the Circuit Courts having been abolished, expressly conferred upon the District Courts jurisdiction 'of all crimes and offenses cognizable under the authority of the United States.' This is a broad and comprehensive grant, and gives the courts named power to try every criminal case cognizable under the authority of the United States, subject to the controlling provisions of the Constitution. In the absence of a valid consent, the District Court cannot proceed except with a jury, not because a jury is necessary to its jurisdiction, but because the accused is entitled by the terms of the Constitution to that mode of trial. Since, however, the right to a jury trial may be waived, it would be unreasonable to leave the court powerless to give effect to the waiver and itself dispose of the case. We are of opinion that the court has authority in the exercise of a sound discretion to accept the waiver, and, as a necessary corollary, to proceed to the trial and determination of the case with a reduced number or without a jury; and that jurisdiction to that end is vested by the foregoing statutory provisions. The power of waiver being established, this is the clear import of the decision of this court in Schick v. United States, \n195 U.S. 65\n, 70-71, 24 S. Ct. 826, 828, 1 Ann. Cas. 585:\n'By  563, Rev. Stat. (superseded by  24, Judicial Code) the district courts are given jurisdiction 'of all crimes and offenses cogniable under the authority of the United States, committed within their respective districts, or upon the high seas, the punishment of which is not capital.' There is no act of Congress requiring that the trial of all offenses shall be by jury, and a court is fully organized and competent for the transaction of business without the presence of a jury.' \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 300]\n\u00a0\n See, also, Ex parte Belt, \n159 \nU.S. 95\n, 15 S. Ct. 987; and Riddle v. Dyche, \n262 \nU.S. 333\n, 43 S. Ct. 555, both of which are out of harmony with the notion that the presence of a jury is a constitutional prerequisite to the jurisdiction of the court in a criminal case. The first of these cases involved the validity of an act of Congress authorizing waiver of a jury in criminal cases in the District of Columbia. The Court of Appeals of that District upheld the statute in Belt v. United States, 4 App. D. C. 25. Leave was asked of this court to file a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Upon this application, the qustion to be answered was (page 97 of 159 U. S., 15 S. Ct. 987):\n\n'Does the ground of this application go to the jurisdiction or authority of the supreme court of the District, or, rather, is it not an allegation of mere error? If the latter, it cannot be reviewed in this proceeding. In re Schneider, \n148 \nU.S. 162\n, 13 S. Ct. 572, and cases cited.'\n\n After reviewing authorities, it was held that the Supreme Court of the District had jurisdiction to determine the validity of the act which authorized the waiver, and that its action could not be reviewed on habeas corpus.\n In the second case, Riddle, on habeas corpus, assailed a conviction in a federal District Court upon the ground that the jury was composed of only eleven men. This court held that the trial court had jurisdiction, and a record showing upon its face that a lawful jury had been impaneled, sworn, and charged could not be collaterally impeached. The remedy was by writ of error.\n This conclusion in respect of the jurisdiction of the courts, notwithstanding the peremptory words of the third article of the Constitution, is fortified by a consideration of certain provisions of the Judiciary Act of 1789 (1 Stat. 73). That act was passed shortly after the organization of the government under the Constitution, and on the day preceding the proposal of the first ten amendments by the first Congress. Among the members of that Congress were many who had participated in the \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 301]\n\u00a0\n convention which framed the Constitution, and the act has always been considered, in relation to that instrument, as a contemporaneous exposition of the highest authority. Capital Traction Company v. Hof, supra, pages 9, 10, of 174 U. S., 19 S. Ct. 580, and cases cited. Section 9 of that act provides that 'the trial of issues in (of) fact, in the district courts, in all causes except civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, shall be by jury.' Section 12 provides that 'the trial of issues in (of) fact in the circuit courts shall, in all suits, except those of equity, and of admiralty, and maritime jurisdiction, be by jury.'\n It will be observed that this language is mandatory in form, and is precisely the same as that of article 3,  2, of the Constitution. It is fair to assume that the framers of the statute, in using the words of the Constitution, intended they should have the same meaning; and if the purpose of the latter was jurisdictional, it is not easy to avoid the conclusion that the purpose of the former was the same. But this court had always held, beginning at an early day, that, notwithstanding the imperative language of the statute, it was competent for the parties to waive a trial by jury. The early cases are collected in a foot note to Kearney v. Case, 12 Wall. 275, 281, following the statement:\n'Undoubtedly both the Judiciary Act and the amendment to the Constitution secured the right to either party in a suit at common law to a trial by jury, and we are also of opinion that the statute of 1789 intended to point out this as the mode of trial in issues of fact in such cases. Numerous decisions, however, had settled that this right to a jury trial might be waived by the parties, and that the judgment of the court in such cases should be valid.'\n\n The Seventh Amendment, which is here referred to, provides, in respect of suits at common law involving a value exceeding $20, that 'the right of trial \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 302]\n\u00a0\n by jury shall be preserved'; and it is significant that this language and the positive provision of the statute that 'the trial of issues in fact ... shall be by jury' were regarded as synonymous.\n Another ground frequently relied upon for denying the power of a person accused of a serious crime to waive trial by jury is that such a proceeding is against public policy. The decisions are conflicting. The leading case in support of the proposition, and one which has influenced other decisions advancing similar views, is Cancemi v. People, 18 N. Y. 128, 137-138. In that case Cancemi was indicted for the crime of murder. After a jury had been impaneled and sworn, and the trial begun, under a stipulation made by the prisoner and his counsel and counsel for the people, and with the express consent and request of the prisoner, a juror was withdrawn, and a verdict subsequently rendered by the remaining eleven jurors. On appeal a judgment based upon this verdict was reversed. The case was decided in 1858, and the question was regarded by the court as one of first impression. The following excerpt from the opinion indicates the basis of the decision:\n'The state, the public, have an interest in the preservation of the liberties and the lives of the citizens, and will not allow them to be taken away 'without due process of law' (Const. art. 1,  6), when forfeited, as they may be, as a punishment for crimes. Criminal prosecutions proceed on the assumption of such a forfeiture, which, to sustain them, must be ascertained and declared as the law has prescribed. Blackstone (vol. 4, 189) says: 'The king has an interest in the preservation of all his subjects.' ... Objections to jurors may be waived; the court may be substituted for triers to dispose of challenges to jurors; secondary in place of primary evidence may be received; admissions of facts \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 303]\n\u00a0\n are allowed; and in similar particulars, as wll as in relation to mere formal proceedings generally, consent will render valid, what without it would be erroneous. A plea of guilty to any indictment, whatever may be the grade of the crime, will be received and acted upon if it is made clearly to appear that the nature and effect of it are understood by the accused. in such a case the preliminary investigation of a grand jury, with the admission of the accusation in the indictment, is supposed to be a sufficient safeguard to the public interests. But when issue is joined upon an indictment, the trial must be by the tribunal and in the mode which the constitution and laws provide, without any essential change. The public officer prosecuting for the people had no authority to consent to such a change, nor has the defendant.\n\n'Applying the above reasoning to the present case, the conclusion necessarilty follows, that the consent of the plaintiff in error to the withdrawal of one juror, and that the remaining eleven might render a verdict, could not lawfully be recognized by the court, at the circuit, and was a nullity. If a deficiency of one juror might be waived, there appears to be no good reason why a deficiency of eleven might not be; and it is difficult to say why, upon the same principle, the entire panel might not be dispensed with, and the trial committed to the court alone. It would be a highly dangerous innovation, in reference to criminal cases, upon the ancient and invaluable institution of trial by jury, and the constitution and laws establishing and securing that mode of trial, for the court to allow of any number short of a full panel of twelve jurors, and we think it ought not to be tolerated.'\n\n Ad decision flatly to the contrary, and one fairly representative of others to the same effect, is State v. Kaufman, 51 Iowa, 578, 2 N. W. 275, 33 Am. Rep. 148. The defendant there was indicted \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 304]\n\u00a0\n for forgery. Upon the trial, one of the jurors, being ill, was discharged with the consent of the defendant, and the trial concluded with the remaining eleven. There was a verdict of guilty. Upon appeal the verdict was upheld. The authorities upon the question are reviewed, and in the course of the opinion the court says at pages 579-580 of 51 Iowa, 2 N. W. 275, 276, 33 Am. Rep. 148:\n'A plea of guilty ordinarily dispenses with a jury trial, and it is thereby waived. This, it seems to us, effectually destroys the force of the thought that 'the state (the public) have an interest in the preservation of the lives and the liberties of the citizens, and will not allow them to be taken away without due process of law.' The same thought is otherwise expressed by Blackstone, vol. 4, 189, that 'the king has an interest in the preservation of all his subjects.'\n\n'It matters not whether the defendant is in fact guilty, the plea of guilty is just as effectual as if such was the case. Reasons other than the fact that he is guilty may induce a defendant to so plead, and thereby the state may be deprived of the services of the citizen, and yet the state never actively interferes in such case, and the right of the defendant to so plead has never been doubted. He must be permitted to judge for himself in this respect. So in the case at bar. The defendant may have consented to be tried by eleven jurors because his witnesses were there present and he might not be able to get them again, or that it was best he should be tried by the jury as thus constituted. Why should he not be permitted to do so? Why hamper him in this respect? Why restrain his liberty or right to do as he believed to be for his interest? Whatever rule is adopted affects not only the defendant, but all others similarly situated, no matter how much they desire to avail themselves of the right to do what the defendant desires to repudiate. We are unwilling to establish such a rule.' \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 305]\n\u00a0\n Referring to the statement in the Cancemi Case, that it would be a highly dangerous innovation to allow any number short of a full panel of twelve jurors and one not to be tolerated, it is said at page 581 of 51 Iowa, 2 N. W. 275, 277, 33 Am. Rep. 148:\n\n'This would have been much more convincing and satisfactory if we had been informed why it would be 'highly dangerous' and should 'not be tolerated,' or at least something which has a tendency in that direction. For if it be true, as stated, it certainly would not be difficult to give a satisfactory reason in support of the strong language used.'\n\n See, also, State v. Sackett, 39 Minn. 69, at page 72, 38 N. W. 773, 775, where the court concludes its discussion of the subject by saying:\n'The wise and beneficient provisions found in the constitution and statutes designed for the welfare and protection of the accused, may be waived, in matters of form and substance, when jurisdiction has been acquired, and within such limits as the trial court, exercising a sound discretion in behalf of those before it, may permit. The defendants, having formally waived a juror, and stipulated to try their case with 11, cannot now claim that there was a fatal irregularity in their trial.'\n\n It is difficult to see why the fact, frequently suggested, that the accused may plead guilty and thus dispense with a trial altogether, does not effectively disclose the fallacy of the public policy contention; for if the state may interpose the claim of public interest between the accused and his desire to waive a jury trial, a fortiori it should be able to interpose a like claim between him and his determination to avoid any form of trial by admitting his guilt. If he be free to decide the question for himself in the latter case, notwithstanding the interest of society in the preservation of his life and liberty, why should he be denied the power to do so in the former? It is no answer to say that by pleading guilty there is nothing left for a jury to try, for that simply ignores the question, which is not \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 306]\n\u00a0\n what is the effect of the plea, the answer to which is fairly obvious, but, in view of the interest of the public in the life and liberty of the accused, can the plea be accepted and acted upon, or must the question of guilt be submitted to a jury at all events? Moreover, the suggestion is wholly beside the point, which is that public policy is not so inconsistent as to permit the accused to dispense with every form of trial by a plea of guilty, and yet forbid him to dispense with a particular form of trial by consent.\n The truth is that the theory of public policy embodies a doctrine of vague and variable quality, and, unless deducible in the given circumstances from constitutional or statutory provisions, should be accepted as the basis of a judicial determination, if at all, only with the utmost circumspection. The public policy of one generation may not, under changed conditions, be the public policy of another.\n It may be conceded, at least generally, that under the rule of the common law the accused was not permitted to waive trial by jury, as generally he was not permitted to waive any right which was intended for his protection. Nevertheless, in the Colonies such a waiver and trial by the court without a jury was by no means unknown, as the many references contained in the brief of the Solicitor General conclusively show. But this phase of the matter we do not stop to consider, for the rule of the common law, whether exclusive or subject to exceptions, was justified by conditions which no longer exist; and as the Supreme Court of Nevada well said in Reno Smelting Works v. Stevenson, 20 Nev. 269, 279, 21 P. 317, 320, 4 L. R. A. 60, 19 Am. St. Rep. 364:\n'It is contrary to the spirit of the common law itself to apply a rule founded on a particular reason to a case where that reason utterly fails,-cessante ratione legis, cessat ipsa lex.' \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 307]\n\u00a0\n The maxim seems strikingly apposite to the question here under review. Among other restraints at common law, the accused could not testify in his own behalf; in felonies he was not allowed counsel (IV Sharswood's Blackstone, 355, note 14), the judge in such cases occupying the place of counsel for the prisoner, charged with the responsibility of seeing that the prisoner did not suffer from lack of other counsel (Id.); and conviction of crime worked an attaint and forfeiture of official titles of inheritance, which, as Judge Aldrich points out (quotation supra), constituted in a large sense the reason for withholding holding from accused parties the right of waiver.\n\n These conditions have ceased to exist, and with their disappearance justification for the old rule, no longer rests upon a substantial basis. In this respect we fully agree with what was said by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in Hack v. State, 141 Wis. 346, 351-352, 124 N. W. 492, 494, 45 L. R. A. (N. S.) 664:\n'The ancient doctrine that the accused could waive nothing was unquestionably founded upon the anxiety of the courts to see that no innocent man should be convicted. It arose in those days when the accused could not testify in his own behalf, was not furnished counsel, and was punished, if convicted, by the death penalty, or some other grievous punishment out of all proportion to the gravity of his crime. Under such circumstances it was well, perhaps, that such a rule should exist and well that every technical requirement should be insisted on, when the state demanded its meed of blood. Such a course raised up a sort of a barrier which the court could utilize when a prosecution was successful which ought not to have been successful, or when a man without money, without counsel, without ability to summon witnesses, and not permitted to tell his own story, has been unjustly convicted but yet under the ordinary principles of waiver \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 308]\n\u00a0\n as applied to civil matters, had waived every defect in the proceedings.\n\n'Thanks to the humane policy of the modern criminal law, we have changed all these conditions. The man now charged with crime is furnished the most complete opportunity for making his defense. He may testify in his own behalf; if he be poor, he may have counsel furnished him by the state, and may have his witnesses summoned and paid for by the state; not infrequently he is thus furnished counsel more able than the attorney for the state, in short the modern law has taken as great pains to surround the accused person with the means to effectively make his defense as the ancient law took pains to prevent that consummation. The reasons which in some sense justified the former attitude of the courts have therefore disappeared, save perhaps in capital cases, and the question is, Shall we adhere to the principle based upon conditions no longer existing? No sound reason occurs to us why a person accused of a lesser crime or misdemeanor, who comes into court with his attorney, fully advised of all his rights, and furnished with every means of making his defense, should not be held to waive a right or privilege for which he does not ask, just as a party to a civil action waives such a right by not asking for it.'\n\n The view that power to waive a trial by jury in criminal cases should be denied on grounds of public policy must be rejected as unsound.\n It is not denied that a jury trial may be waived in the case of petty offenses, but the contention is that the rule is otherwise in the case of crimes of the magnitude of the one here under consideration. There are decisions to that effect, and also decisions to the contrary. The conflict is marked and direct. Schick v. United States, supra, is thought to favor the contention. There the prosecution \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 309]\n\u00a0\n was for a violation of the Oleomargarine Act (24 Stat. 209), punishable by fine only. By agreement is writing a jury was waived and the issue submitted to the court. Judgment was for the United States. This court held that the offense was a petty one, and sustained the waiver. It was said that the word 'crimes' in article 3,  2, of the Constitution, should be read in the light of the common law, and, so read, it does not include petty offenses; and that neither the constitutional provisions nor any rule of public policy prevented the defendant from waiving a jury trial. The question whether the power of waiver extended to serious offenses was not directly involved, and is not concluded by that decision. Mr. Justice Harlan, in a dissenting opinion, after reviewing the authorities, concluded (page 83 of 195 U. S., 24 S. Ct. 826, 833, 1 Ann. Cas. 585) that: 'The grounds upon which the decisions rest are, upon principle, applicable alike in cases of felonies and misdemeanors, although the consequences to the accused may be more evident as well as more serious in the former than in the latter cases.'\n Although we reject the general view of the dissenting opinion that a waiver of jury trial is not valid in any criminal case, we accept the foregoing statement as entirely sound. We are unable to find in the decisions any convincing ground for holding that a waiver is effective in misdemeanor cases, but not effective in the case of felonies. In most of the decisions no real attempt is made to establish a distinction, beyond the assertion that public policy favors the power of waiver in the former, but denies it in the latter because of the more serious consequences in the form of punishment which may ensue. But that suggested differentation, in the light of what has now been said, seems to us more fanciful than real. The Schick Case, it is true, dealt with a petty offense, but, in view of the conclusions we have already \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 310]\n\u00a0\n reached and stated, the observations of the court (pages 71, 72 of 195 U. S., 24 S. Ct. 826, 828) have become equally pertinent where a felony is involved:\n'Article six of the amendments, as we have seen, gives the accused a right to a trial by jury. But the same article gives him the further right 'to be confronted with the witnesses against him ... and to have the assistance of counsel.' Is it possible that an accused cannot admit, and be bound by the admission, that a witness not present would testify to certain facts? Can it be that if he does not wish the assistance of counsel, and waives it, the trial is invalid? It seems only necessary to ask these questions to answer them. When there is no constitutional or statutory mandate, and no public policy prohibiting, an accused may waive any privilege which he is given the right to enjoy.'\n\n In Commonwealth v. Beard, 48 Pa. Super. Ct. 319, the prosecution was for conspiracy, and there, as here, one of the jurors was discharged and the trial concluded with the remaining eleven. Judgment on a verdict of conviction was sustained. The court, after reviewing the conflicting decisions, was unable to find any good reason for differentiating in the matter of waiver between the two classes of crimes. We fully indorse its concluding words upon that subject at pages 323-324:\n'It surely cannot be true that the public is interested in the protection of an accused in proportion to the magnitude of his offending-that its solicitude goes out to the great offender but not to the small-that there is a difference in point of sacredness between constitutional rights when asserted by one charged with a grave crime and when asserted by one charged with a lesser one. Hence, when it is held in Schick v. U. S., \n195 \nU.S. 65\n, 24 S. Ct. 826, 1 Ann. Cas. 585, that in trials for the lowest grades of offenses the accused may waive, not only the continued presence of the full number of jurors re- \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 311]\n\u00a0\n quired to make up a jury, but the right to trial by jury, the only possible conclusion is that the purely theoretical element of public concern, as potential to override the accused's own free choice and render him effectually unfree even before conviction and sentence, cannot be regarded as in reality much of a factor in any case.'\n\n This view of the matter subsequently had the approval of the Supreme Court of the state in Commonwealth ex rel. Ross v. Egan, 281 Pa. 251, 126 A. 488. After noting the conflict of authority, and that a waiver has been held to be effective in a number of states which are named, it is there said at pages 255, 256, 257 of 281 Pa., 126 A. 488, 490:\n'A defendant is supposed to understand his rights, and may be aided, if he so desires, by counsel to advise him. There are many legal provisions for his security and benefit which he may dispense with absolutely, as, for instance, his right to plead guilty and submit to sentence without any trial whatsoever. ...\n\n'The theory upon which the opposing cases are decided seems to rest on the proposition that society at large is as much interested in an impartial trial of a defendant, who may be sentenced to imprisonment, as he himself is, and therefore no permission to waive any right, when charged with a felony, should be accorded to him. There may be reason for applying this rule to capital cases, as has been done in Pennsylvania, but such a principle ought not to be invoked to relieve those charged with lesser offenses, such as larceny (though technically denominated a felony), from the consequences of their own voluntary act, and, where it appears by the record that consent to the course pursued was freely given, the defendant should not be heard thereafter to complain. ...\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 276, 312]\n\u00a0\n 'The solution of the question depends upon the determination whether a trial by less than 12 is an irregularity or a nullity. If the latter be held, no sentence imposed may be sustained, but the contrary is true, if the former and correct conclusion be reached. In the case of misdemeanors, the Superior Court has sustained the sentences where a voluntary waiver appeared. Com. v. Beard, supra. No real justification for a different decision in the case of felonies, not capital, can be supported.'\n See, also, Commonwealth v. Rowe, 257 Mass. 172, 174-176, 153 N. E. 537, 48 A. L. R. 762; State v. Ross, 47 S. D. 188, 192-193, 197 N. W. 234, involving a misdemeanor, but followed in State v. Tiedeman, 49 S. D. 356, 360, 207 N. W. 153, involving a felony.\n In affirming the power of the defendant in any criminal case to waive a trial by a constitutional jury and submit to trial by a jury of less than twelve persons, or by the court, we do not mean to hold that the waiver must be put into effect at all events. That perhaps sufficiently appears already. Trial by jury is the normal and, with occasional exceptions, the preferable mode of disposing of issues of fact in criminal cases above the grade of petty offenses. In such cases the value and appropriateness of jury trial have been established by long experience, and are not now to be denied. Not only must the right of the accused to a trial by a constitutional jury be jealously preserved, but the maintenance of the jury as a fact-finding body in criminal cases is of such importance and has such a place in our traditions, that, before any waiver can become effective, the consent of government counsel and the sanction of the court must be had, in addition to the express and intelligent consent of the defendant. And the duty of the trial court in that regard is not to be discharged as a mere matter of rote, but with sound and advised discretion, with an eye to avoid unreasonable or undue departures from that mode of \n\n[281 U.S. 276, 313]\n\u00a0\n trial or from any of the essential elements thereof, and with a caution increasing in degree as the offenses dealt with increase in gravity.\n The question submitted must be answered in the affirmative.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice STONE concur in the result.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n Mr. Justice SANFORD participated in the consideration and agreed to a disposition of the case in accordance with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","100":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPIEDMONT & N.

Co. and others.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Paragraph 18 of section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by Transportation Act 1920, February 28, c. 91,  402, 41 Stat. 456, 477, 478 (49 USCA  1(18), prohibits any carrier by railroad subject to that act from undertaking any extension of its lines or construction of new lines, without first obtaining from the Interstate Commerce Commission a certificate of public necessity and convenience. Paragraphs 19 and 20 provide for applications for certificates and prescribe the procedure and mode of disposal. Paragraph 22 exempts from the scope of those provisions the construction of industrial and certain other tracks 'located wholly within one State, or of street, suburban, or interurban electric railways, which are not operated as a part or parts of a general steam railroad system of transportation.'\n The Piedmont & Northern Railway, a carrier by railroad subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, operates in interstate commerce about 128 miles of line in North and South Carolina, using exclusively electric locomotives. It determined to extend its lines 53 miles on one route and 75 miles on another, in order to connect with several steam railroads; and, believing that the above provisions of that act were inapplicable, it intended to make the proposed extensions without securing from the Commission a certificate of public necessity and convenience. The Commission, learning informally of the project, advised the railway by letter that before it 'constructs any extensions to its line or issues any securities it will be expected \n\n[280 U.S. 469, 474]\n\u00a0\n to file appropriate applications for authority therefor under sections 1 and 20a (49 USCA  1, 20a). The filing of such applications will, of course, be without prejudice to your right to assert that the Commission has no jurisdiction over your property in those respects and to adduce whatever evidence you may desire to support such contention.' The letter called attention to the following passage in Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266, 272\n, 46 S. Ct. 263, 264:\n'Whenever such an application is made, the Commission may pass incidentally upon the question whether what is called an extension is in act such; for if it proves to be only an industrial track, the Commission must decline, on that ground, to issue a certificate. A carrier desiring to construct new tracks does not, by making application to the Commission, necessarily admit that they constitute an extension. It may secure a determination of the question, without waiving any right, by asserting in the application that in its opinion a certificate is not required, because the construction involves only an industrial track.'\n\n Upon receipt of this letter, the railway filed an application for a certificate of public necessity and convenience; and it asserted therein that the proposed extensions were parts of a single project undertaken prior to the effective date of paragraph 181 and that it was an interurban electric railway within the exemption of paragraph 22. It accordingly moved that its application be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The Commission overruled the motion; took jurisdiction; and entered an order denying the application on its merits. Proposed Construction of Lines by Piedmont & Northern Ry. Co., 138 \n\n[280 U.S. 469, 475]\n\u00a0\n I. C. C. 363. This suit was then brought by the railway against the United States in the federal court for Western South Carolina, under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208 219, 220, U. S. C. tit. 28,  47 (28 USCA  47), and, as the bill states, also under 'the general equity jurisdiction' of the court. The bill charges that, if the order is not set aside, the railway 'will be prevented from constructing the new mileage'; and prays for 'a permanent injunction decreeing that the Commission was without jurisdiction of the application,' that the order 'taking jurisdiction of said application and denying the same, be set aside and annulled, and that the Commission be forever enjoined from taking any action or proceeding against your petitioner under said order.' The National Association of Railroad and Utility Commissioners intervened as plaintiff. The Interstate Commerce Commission, the Southern Railway, and other steam railroads intervened as defendants. The Commission moved to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction. The court, three judges sitting, denied the motion; and, the case being submitted on final hearing upon the pleadings and the record before the Commission, entered a decree dismissing the bill on the merits. (D. C.) 30 F.(2d) 421. A direct appeal to this Court was taken by both plaintiffs under section 238(4) of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229,  1, 43 Stat. 936, 938, U. S. C. tit. 28,  345 (28 USCA  345(d).\n Plaintiffs do not complain of the order's denial of a certificate of public necessity and convenience. They concede that no court has the power to compel the Commission to issue such a certificate, since no railroad subject to the provisions of the act has a right to extend its lines. Therefore, the order denying a certificate, being negative in substance as well as in form, infringed no right of the railway. Compare Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 282\n, 32 S. Ct. 761; Lehigh Valley R. R. Co. v. \n\n[280 U.S. 469, 476]\n\u00a0\n United States, \n243 \nU.S. 412\n, 37 S. Ct. 397; United States v. New River Co., \n265 \nU.S. 533, 540\n, 44 S. Ct. 610. The plaintiffs have also abandoned, in this Court, their contention that the proposed extensions are part of a project undertaken prior to the effective date of paragraph 18. Their sole contention is that the court below and the Commission erred in not holding that the railway is an interurban electric railway within the exemption of paragraph 22. The defendants renew their objections to the jurisdiction of the court.\n We think that the defendants' objection is well taken. There is no allegation of fact in the bill, and no provision in the statute, which supports the charge that the order will prevent the railway from proceeding with the construction of the new mileage. The order is wholly unlike a decree which dismisses a bill in equity on the merits when it should have been dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Such a decree must be set aside because, otherwise, it might be held to operate as res judicata. Compare Swift & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 311, 325\n, 326 S., 48 S. Ct. 311; New Orleans v. Fisher, \n180 \nU.S. 185, 196\n, 21 S. Ct. 347; Dowell v. Applegate, \n152 U.S. 327\n, 337-341, 14 S. Ct. 611. But neither the assumption of jurisdiction by the Commission nor its denial of the application can operate as res judicata of the railway's claim of immunity. If, as is contended, the Commission was without jurisdiction, the railway is as free to proceed with the construction as if the application had not been made and the Commission had not acted. Nothing done by the Commission can prejudice the railway's claim to immunity in any other proceeding.\n It is true that, if the railway builds without having secured a certificate, it may suffer serious loss. For a court may hold, in an appropriate proceeding, that the railway is within the purview of paragraph 18. And the railway may be thus subjected to the penalties prescribed by paragraph 20. These risks arise, however, not from \n\n[280 U.S. 469, 477]\n\u00a0\n the order, but from the statute. Compare Lehigh Valley R. R. Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 412, 414\n, 37 S. Ct. 397. The order is entirely negative. It is not susceptible of violation and cannot call for enforcement. It does not finally adjudicate the railway's standing; nor does it enjoin it to do or refrain from doing anything. The penalties provided in paragraph 20 are prescribed not for violation of an order of the Commission, but for violation of the provisions of the statute. And the apprehended loss will be no greater by virtue of the Commission's order than if the railway had commenced building without trying to secure a certificate, as was done in Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266\n, 46 S. Ct. 263. There is no suggestion in the bill how the Commission or the government could conceivably take any action under the order.\n The action taken by the Commission may lend greater justification to the railway's fear of the uncertainty instinct in the prophecy as to whether it will be held to be an interurban electric within the meaning of paragraph 22. But it does not alter the substance of the remedy sought. That is the same as if the suit had been brought by the railway prior to any action by the Commission, except that the railway may be bound by the record made before the Commission. The relief which plaintiffs seek is not from the order but from the uncertainty as to the applicability of the statute. If the statute gives the Commission jurisdiction over the railway's application, then concededly the order is not subject to attack. If, on the other hand, the statute does not confer the jurisdiction, then obviously the order is no obstacle to the railway's plans. What plaintiffs are seeking is, therefore, in substance, a declaratory judgment that the railway is within the exemption contained in paragraph 22 of the act. Such a remedy is not within either the statutory or the equity jurisdiction of federal courts. Com- \n\n[280 U.S. 469, 478]\n\u00a0\n pare Willing v.

Ct. 317, and Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153\n, 46 S. Ct. 452. There, a judicial review is provided in order to protect a legal right of the plaintiff alleged to have been infringed by an order which authorizes affirmative action.\n Since plaintiff's bill was dismissed on the merits when it should have been dismissed for want of jurisdiction, the decree must be reversed with directions to dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction.

C. C. 659. The Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway Company had for some years owned and maintained an independent passenger station at Ontario street in Cleveland in the line of the easterly approach to the proposed union terminal. It was apparent from the outset that either ownership of or an easement in the Wheeling's site would be indispensable in order to provide the necessary easterly approach to the terminal. \n2\n Long negotiations culminated in a plan whereby the Wheeling consented to sell its site and become a tenant in the new terminal at an annual rental of $20,000. Contracts were made embodying this plan, subject to approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[281 U.S. 479, 483]\n\u00a0\n Thereupon, the Wheeling filed before the Commission two applications for certificates of public convenicence and necessity, one permitting it to abandon its Ontario Street station,4 the other authorizing it to use the facilities of the union terminal and, pending its completion, to use the facilities of the station of the Erie Railroad and the tracks of the Big Four. These applications were heard together as one case. The Pittsburgh & West Virginia Railway, a minority stockholder and connecting carrier of the Wheeling, was permitted to intervene and was heard in opposition to the applications. It opposed them on the grounds that the Ontario Street Station was ample for both the present and future needs of the Wheeling; that the Wheeling's applications were authorized by directors elected by the votes of stock owned in violation of the Clayton Act (38 Stat. 730) by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, the New York Central, and the Nickel Plate (Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 152 I. C. C. 721); that the contracts executed by the Wheeling were made without first securing the consent of its stockholders, as required by the laws of Ohio; that the Wheeling's directors were interested in the union terminal project, and did not give the Wheeling the benefit of their unbiased judgment; that the price to be paid the Wheeling for its site was inadequate and not the best price obtainable; that the Terminals Company is a common carrier whose rates are subject to regulation; that the yearly rental to be paid by the Wheeling is unduly low and unreasonably preferential of the Wheeling; that it is \n\n[281 U.S. 479, 484]\n\u00a0\n therefore subject to be increased by the Interstate Commerce Commission; and that, if increased so as to eliminate the preference, it would confessedly be much more than the Wheeling could afford to pay and would imperil its financial condition.\n The Commission held that the violation of the Clayton Act was immaterial since the election of the directors occurred prior to the Commission's finding of violation, and the finding was not made retroactive; that it lacked jurisdiction to pass upon the alleged violations of Ohio law or upon the adequacy of the price agreed to be paid for the Wheeling's site; that, under paragraph 4 of section 3 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  3(4), the agreed rental for the Wheeling's use of the Union Station was not subject to be increased by it; and that, in view of all the circumstances, the rental was not unduly preferential of the Wheeling. It found that public convenience and necessity would be served by the granting of both applications; and accordingly issued its certificate as prayed for. Operation of Passenger Terminal Facilities at Cleveland, Ohio, by Wheeling & Lake Erie Ry. Co., 154 I. C. C. 516.\n The Pittsburgh & West Virginia then brought this suit in the District Court for Northern Ohio, Eastern Division. It joined as defendants the Wheeling, the Erie, the Big Four, the Terminals Company, the Building Company, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the United States. The purpose of the suit, as stated in the complaint, was two-fold: First, to enjoin the Wheeling from abandoning its Ontario Street Station and from performing its contracts with the other defendants; secondly, to set aside and annul the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission granting the certificate of public convenience and necessity. Separate relief was prayed for accordingly. As against the Wheeling, the prayer was founded on the several grounds advanced before the Commission. As against the United States and the Commission, on the \n\n[281 U.S. 479, 485]\n\u00a0\n additional ground that the order was based on erroneous conclusions of law, to wit, that the Commission had no jurisdiction to pass on the adequacy of the price to be paid for the land and on the alleged violations of the laws of Ohio; that the Wheeling's directors were competent to act for it in this matter; and that the rental agreed to be paid by the Wheeling for the use of the union terminal facilities was not subject to be increased by the Commission.\n The Pittsburgh moved for an interlocutory injunction. As the bill sought to suspend and set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the District Judge called to his assistance two additional judges pursuant to the Urgent Deficiencies Act, October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219, 220 (28 USCA  47). By consent of the parties, the case was then heard, as upon final hearing;5 and the court \n\n[281 U.S. 479, 486]\n\u00a0\n entered a final decree dismissing the bill on the merits as to both classes of relief prayed for. It declared, however, that the questions concerning the alleged violation of Ohio law, the competency of the Wheeling's directors, and the other grounds of attack on the Wheeling's action were not properly before it as a three judge court. But, since diversity of citizenship existed and the District Judge concurred in the judgment, the court passed on them and reserved to appellant the right to sever these issues for purposes of appeal and treat its decision on them as the decision of a single judge. Pittsburgh & West Virginia Ry. Co. v. United States, 41 F.(2d) 806. Appellant did not avail itself of this privilege, but prosecuted a direct appeal to this Court from the whole decree. It repeats here the several grounds of attack urged before the District Court. We have no occasion to consider the merits of the controversy. For we are of opinion that appellant had no standing to bring this suit as one to set aside an order of the Commission; and that, in so far as the suit may be treated as one within the general equity jurisdiction of the District Court, we have no jurisdiction on a direct appeal to review its decision.\n First. The District Court held that the appellant was entitled to bring this suit under the Urgent Deficiencies Act to set aside the order, because it had intervened in the proceedings before the Commission, and because it is a connecting carrier and a minority stockholder of the Wheeling. The court erred in so holding. The mere fact that appellant was permitted to intervene before the Commission does not entitle it to institute an independent suit to set aside the Commission's order in the absence of resulting actual or threatened legal injury to it. Alexander Sprunt & Son v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 249\n, 50 S. Ct. 315, 74 L. Ed. - ( No. 19, decided April 14, 1930). Nor does the mere fact that its lines connect with those of the \n\n[281 U.S. 479, 487]\n\u00a0\n Wheeling near the city of Pittsburgh, Pa.,6 entitle it to bring the suit. Its lines do not extend to Cleveland; and there is no suggestion that the order can affect it as carrier. 7 Finally, the claim that the order threatens the Wheeling's financial stability, and consequently appellant's financial interest as a minority stockholder, is not sufficient to show a threat of the legal injury necessary to entitle it to bring a suit to set aside the order. This financial interest does not differ from that of every investor in Wheeling securities or from an investor's interest in any business transaction or lawsuit of his corporation. Unlike orders entered in cases of reorganization, and in some cases of acquisition of control of one carrier by another,8 the order under attack does not deal with the interests of investors. The injury feared is the indirect harm which may result to every stockholder from harm to the corporation. Such stockholder's interest is clearly insufficient to give the Pittsburgh a standing independently to institute suit to annul \n\n[281 U.S. 479, 488]\n\u00a0\n this order. The bill should have been dismissed without inquiry into the merits.\n Second. The prayer that the contemplated action of the Wheeling should be enjoined because its directors hold office illegally, are faithless to their trust, are acting in violation of the rights of stockholders under the Ohio law, and, hence, that the Wheeling could not legally exercise the authority granted to it by the Commission, was not properly joined in this suit and is not subject to review in this Court on a direct appeal. An application for such relief may not be included in a bill under the Urgent Deficiencies Act to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Compare Cleveland, etc., Ry. Co. v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 404, 414\n, 48 S. Ct. 189; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 172, 181\n, 48 S. Ct. 466. It is neither ancillary to nor dependent upon the judgment as to the order. Relief of that character may be had only in a suit invoking the plenary equity jurisdiction of the District Court. Such a suit would be heard in ordinary course by a single judge; and it would be appealable only to the Circuit Court of Appeals. The case at bar is wholly unlike The Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 269\n, 44 S. Ct. 317, where a prayer to set aside the illegal purchase of stock and the lease already made was held proper as ancillary to setting aside the order of the Commission authorizing the same. There, the joinder was permitted in order to carry out the purpose of Congress to make the judicial review effective. Here, such joinder is unnecessary for that purpose. Moreover, grounds for general equitable relief, obviously, cannot give the Pittsburgh a standing in this Court on direct appeal under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, when it had no right to bring suit under that act.\n While there was no occasion for the District Court to consider the merits, the bill was properly dismissed. The \n\n[281 U.S. 479, 489]\n\u00a0\n decree is affirmed without prejudice to the right, if any, of the Pittsburgh to enjoin in a proper proceeding action by the Wheeling.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Application for this authority had previously been dismissed. 70 I.

A.) 33 F.(2d) 390. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] When the motion for a preliminary injunction was reached for hearing, the court formally 'announced that the hearing, either temporary or as final, would be considered as involving two classes of questions: First, those involving the validity of the order of Interstate Commerce Commission as dependent upon the record before it and thus involving questions of public interest in which the United States and Interstate Commerce Commission are interested; and, second, those involving all other grounds of attack upon the proposed action of the defendant (the Wheeling) and in which neither the United States nor the Interstate Commerce Commission was interested; and that the hearing would proceed upon the first class of questions involved; that the court would then decide whether to dispose of the matter upon those questions or to continue the hearing upon the other question. ... Thereupon ... the record of the proceedings and testimony before the Interstate Commerce Commission ... was received ... upon the first class of questions, and the extent of its admissibility on the second class ... reserved until the hearing of branch of the case.' But no further hearings were held. Appellant claimed the right to introduce additional evidence and excepted to the above ruling of the court. Compare Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v.

SEABORN(1930)\nNo. 15\nArgued: Decided: November 24, 1930\n\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 101, 103]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Thomas D. Thacher, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n\n\n[282 U.S. 101, 106]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George Donworth and Elmer E. Todd, both of Seattle, Wash., for respondent.\n\n\n[282 U.S. 101, 108]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Seaborn and his wife, citizens and residents of the State of Washington, made for the year 1927 separate income tax returns as permitted by the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27,  223 (USCA title 26,  964).\n During and prior to 1927 they accumulated property comprising real estate, stocks, bonds and other personal \n\n[282 U.S. 101, 109]\n\u00a0\n property. While the real estate stood in his name alone, it is undisputed that all of the property real and personal constituted community property and that neither owned any separate property or had any separate income.\n The income comprised Seaborn's salary, interest on bank deposits and on bonds, dividends, and profits on sales of real and personal property. He and his wife each returned one-half the total community income as gross income and each deducted one-half of the community expenses to arrive at the net income returned.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that all of the income should have been reported in the husband's return, and made an additional assessment against him. Seaborn paid under protest, claimed a refund, and on its rejection, brought this suit.\n The District Court rendered judgment for the plaintiff (32 F.(2d) 916 ); the Collector appealed, and the Circuit Court of Appeals certified to us the question whether the husband was bound to report for income tax the entire income, or whether the spouses were entitled each to return one- half thereof. This Court ordered the whole record to be sent up. \n281 \nU.S. 704\n, 50 S. Ct. 459\n\n\n The case requires us to construe sections 210(a) and 211(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 21, USCA tit. 26,  951 note and 952 note), and apply them, as construed, to the interests of husband and wife in community property under the law of Washington. These sections lay a tax upon the net income of every individual. \n1\n The Act goes no farther, and furnishes no other standard or definition of what constitutes an individual's income. The use of the word 'of' denotes ownership. It would be a strained construction, which, in the absence of further definition by Congress, should impute a broader significance to the phrase. \n\n[282 U.S. 101, 110]\n\u00a0\n The Commissioner concedes that the answer to the question involved in the cause must be found in the provisions of the law of the State, as to a wife's ownership of or interest in community property. What, then, is the law of Washington as to the ownership of community property and of community income including the earnings of the husband's and wife's labor?\n The answer is found in the statutes of the State,2 and the decisions interpreting them.\n These statutes provide that, save for property acquired by gift, bequest, devise or inheritance, all property however, acquired after marriage, by either husband or wife, or by both, is community property. On the death of either spouse his or her interest is subject to testamentary disposition, and failing that, it passes to the issue of the decedent and not to the surviving spouse. While the husband has the management and control of community personal property and like power of disposition thereof as of his separate personal property, this power is subject to restrictions which are inconsistent with denial of the wife's interest as co-owner. The wife may borrow for community purposes and bind the community property. Fielding v. Ketler, 86 Wash. 194, 149 P. 667. Since the husband may not discharge his separate obligation out of commnit y property, she may, suing alone, enjoin collection of his separate debt out of community property. Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Clark, 144 Wash. 520, 258 P. 35. She may prevent his making substantial gifts out of community property without her consent. Parker v. Parker, 121 Wash. 24, 207 P. 1062. The community property is not liable for the husband's torts not committed in carrying on the business of the community. Schramm v. Steele, 97 Wash. 309, 166 P. 634. \n\n[282 U.S. 101, 111]\n\u00a0\n The books are full of expressions such as 'the personal property is just as much hers as his' (Marston v. Rue, 92 Wash. 129, 159 P. 111, 112); 'her property right in it (an automobile) is as great as his' (Id., 92 Wash. 133, 159 P. 111, 113); 'the title of the spouse therein was a legal title, as well as that of the other' (Mabie v. Whittaker, 10 Wash. 663, 39 P. 172, 175).\n Without further extending this opinion it must suffice to say that it is clear the wife has, in Washington, a vested property right in the community property, equal with that of her husband; and in the income of the community, including salaries or wages of either husband or wife, or both. A description of the community system of Washington and of the rights of the spouses, and of the powers of the husband as manager, will be found in Warburton v. White, \n176 \nU.S. 484\n, 20 S. Ct. 404.\n The taxpayer contends that if the test of taxability under Sections 210 and 211 is ownership, it is clear that income of community property is owner by the community and that husband and wife have each a present vested one-half interest therein.\n The Commissioner contends, however, that we are here concerned not with mere names, nor even with mere technical legal titles; that calling the wife's interest vested is nothing to the purpose, because the husband has such broad powers of control and alienation, that while the community lasts, he is essentially the owner of the whole community property, and ought so to be considered for the purposes of sections 210 and 211. He points out that as to personal property the husband may convey it, may make contracts affecting it, may do anything with it short of committing a fraud on his wife's rights. And though the wife must join in any sale of real estate, he asserts that the same is true, by virtue of statutes, in most States which do not have the community system. He asserts that control without accountability is indistin- \n\n[282 U.S. 101, 112]\n\u00a0\n guishable from ownership, and that since the husband has this, quoad community property and income, the income is that 'of' the husband under sections 210, 211 of the income tax law.\n We think in view of the law of Washington above stated this contention is unsound. The community must act through an agent. This Court has said with respect to the community property system (Warburton v. White, \n176 \nU.S. 494\n, 20 S. Ct. 404, 408) that 'property acquired during marriage with community funds became an acquet of the community and not the sole property of the one in whose name the property was bought, although by the law existing at the time the husband was given the management, control, and power of sale of such property. This right being vested in him, not because he was the exclusive owner, but because by law he was created the agent of the community.'\n In that case, it was held that such agency of the husband was neither a contract nor a property right vested in him, and that it was competent to the legislature which created the relation to alter it, to confer the agency on the wife alone, or to confer a joint agency on both spouses, if it saw fit-all without infringing any property right of the husband. See, also, Arnett v. Reade, \n220 U.S. 311\n, at page 319, 31 S. Ct. 425, 36 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1040.\n The reasons for conferring such sweeping powers of management on the husband are not far to seek. Public policy demands that in all ordinary circumstances, litigation between wife and husband during the life of the community should be discouraged. Law-suits between them would tnd to subvert the marital relation. The same policy dictates that third parties who deal with the husband respecting community property shall be assured that the wife shall not be permitted to nullify his transactions. The powers of partners, or of trustees of a spendthrift trust, furnish apt analogies. \n\n[282 U.S. 101, 113]\n\u00a0\n The obligations of the husband as agent of the community are no less real because the policy of the State limits the wife's right to call him to account in a court. Power is not synonymous with right. Nor is obligation coterminous with legal remedy. The law's investiture of the husband with broad powers, by no means negatives the wife's present interest as a co-owner.\n We are of opinion that under the law of Washington the entire property and income of the community can no more be said to be that of the husband, than it could rightly be termed that of the wife.\n We should be content to rest our decision on these considerations. Both parties have, however, relied on executive construction and the history of the income tax legislation as supporting their respective views. We shall, therefore, deal with these matters.\n The taxpayer points out that following certain opinions of the Attorney General,3 the Decisions and Regulations of the Treasury have uniformly made the distinction that while under California law the wife's interest in community property amounts to a mere expectancy contingent on her husband's death and does not rise to the level of a present interest, her interest under the laws of Washington, Arizona, Texas and some other states is a present vested one. They have accordingly denied husband and wife the privilege of making separate returns of one-half \n\n[282 U.S. 101, 114]\n\u00a0\n the community income in California, but accorded that privilege to residents of such other states. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n He relies further upon the fact that Congress has thrice,5 since these Decisions and Regulations were promulgated, re-enacted the income tax law without change of the verbiage found in sections 210(a) and 211(a), thus giving legislative sanction to the executive construction. He stands also on the fact that twice the Treasury has suggested the insertion of a provision,6 which would impose the tax on the husband in respect of the whole community income, and that Congress has not seen fit to adopt the suggestion.\n On the other hand the Commissioner says that, granted the truth of these assertions, a different situation has been created as respects 1926 and subsequent years. For in the 1926 Act there was inserted a section which plainly indicated an intent to leave this question open for the future in States other than California, while closing it for past years. The section is copied in the margin. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[282 U.S. 101, 115]\n\u00a0\n We attribute no such intent to the section as is ascribed to it by the Commissioner. We think that although Congress had twice refused to change the wording of the Act, so as to tax community income to the husband in Washington and certain other states, in view of our decision in United States v. Robbins, \n269 \nU.S. 315\n, 46 S. Ct. 148, it felt we might overturn the executive construction and assimilate the situation in Washington to that we had determined existed in California. Section 1212 therefore was merely inserted to prevent the serious situation as to resettlements, additional assessments and refunds which would follow such a decision.\n The same comments apply to the Joint Resolution No. 88, 71st Congress, on which the Commissioner relies. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[282 U.S. 101, 116]\n\u00a0\n It is obvious that this resolution was intended to save the Government's right of resettlement, in event that the proposed test suits, of which this is one, should be decided in favor of the Government's present contention. See the Report of the Ways and Means Committee on the resolution (Cong. Record, June 11, 1930, pp. 10923-10925).\n On the whole, we feel that, were the matter less clear than we think it is, on the words of the income tax law as applied to the situation in Washington, we should be constrained to follow the long and unbroken line of executive construction, applicable to words which Congress repeatedly reemployed in acts passed subsequent to such construction (New York v. Illinois, \n278 \nU.S. 367\n, 49 S. Ct. 163; National Lead Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 140\n, 40 S. Ct. 237; United States v. Farrar, \n281 \nU.S. 624\n, 50 S. Ct. 425), reenforced, as it is, by Congress' refusal to change the wording of the Acts to make community income in states whose law is like that of Washington returnable as the husband's income.\n The Cmmi ssioner urges that we have, in principle, decided the instant question in favor of the Government. He relies on United States v. Robbins, \n269 \nU.S. 315\n, 46 S. Ct. 148; Corliss v. Bowers, \n281 \nU.S. 376\n, 50 S. Ct. 336, and Lucas v. Earl, \n281 \nU.S. 111\n, 50 S. Ct. 241.\n In the Robbins Case, we found that the law of California, as construed by her own courts, gave the wife a mere expectancy and that the property rights of the husband during the life of the community were so complete that he was in fact the owner. Moreover, we there pointed out that this accorded with the executive construction of the Act as to California.\n The Corliss Case raised no issue as to the intent of Congress, but as to its power. We held that where a donor retains the power at any time to revest himself with the principal of the gift, Congress may declare that he still owns the income. While he has technically parted with title, yet he in fact retains ownership, and all its incidents. \n\n[282 U.S. 101, 117]\n\u00a0\n But here the husband never has ownership. That is in the community at the moment of acquisition.\n In the Earl Case a husband and wife contracted that any property they had or might thereafter acquire in any way, either by earnings (including salaries, fees, etc.), or any rights by contract or otherwise, 'shall be treated and considered, and hereby is declared to be received, held, taken, and owned by us as joint tenants. ...' We held that assuming the validity of the contract under local law, it still remained true that the husband's professional fees, earned in years subsequent to the date of the contract, were his individual income, 'derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service,' under section 210, 211, 212(a) and 213 of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1062-1065). The very assignment in that case was bottomed on the fact that the earnings would be the husband's property, else there would have been nothing on which if could operate. That case presents quite a different question from this, because here, by law, the earnings are never the property of the husband, but that of the community.\n Finally the argument is pressed upon us that the Commissioner's ruling will work uniformity of incidence and operation of the tax in the various states, while the view urged by the taxpayer will make the tax fall unevenly upon married people. This argument cuts both ways. When it is remembered that a wife's earnings are a part of the community property equally with her husband's, it may well seem to those who live in states where a wife's earnings are her own, that it would not tend to promote uniformity to tax the husband on her earnings as part of his income. The answer to such argument, however, is, that the constitutional requirement of uniformity is not intrinsic, but geographic. Billings v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 261\n, 34 S. Ct. 421; Head Money Cases, \n112 \nU.S. 580\n, 5 S. Ct. 247; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41\n, 20 S. Ct. 747. And differences of state law, which may bring a person within or without the category \n\n[282 U.S. 101, 118]\n\u00a0\n designated by Congress as taxable, may not be read into the Revenue Act to spell out a lack of uniformity. Florida v. Mellon, \n273 \nU.S. 12\n, 47 S. Ct. 265.\n The District Court was right in holding that the husband and wife were entitled to file separate returns, each treating one-half of the community income as his or her respective incomes, and its judgment is affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The language has been the same in each act since that of February 24, 1919, 40 Stat. 1057. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Remington's Compiled Statutes, 1922, Sections 181, 182, 570, 989, 1145, 1342, 1419, 6890 to 6896, inc., 6900 to 6906, 6908, 7348, 7598, 10572, 10575, 10577 and 10578. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Opinion of Attorney General Palmer, September 10, 1920 (32 Op.

Johnson, both of New York City, for petitioner Powers-Kennedy Contracting Corporation.\n Messrs. Stephen J. Cox, of New York City, and Lynn A. Williams, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent Concrete Mixing & Conveying Corporation.\n Mr. Charles E. Townsend, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent R. C. Storrie & Co.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases involve the validity, and the alleged infringement, of letters patent No. 1,127,660, of date February 9, 1915, issued to John H. McMichael, and assigned to Concrete Mixing & Conveying Company.\n The Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, in Concrete Mixing & Conveying Company v. Ulen Contracting Corporation, 12 F.(2d) 929, held the patent valid and infringed. In No. 3 the District Court followed that decision. Its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit. 27 F.(2d) 668.\n Meantime, in No. 4, the District Court for the Western District of Washington held the patent void for want of novelty and invention. 23 F.( 2d) 131. Subsequent to the decision of the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, that of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the Washington District Court. 27 F.(2d) 838. In view of the conflict \n\n[282 U.S. 175, 177]\n\u00a0\n thus disclosed, this court granted certiorari in both cases, 'the two cases to be heard as one.' \n278 \nU.S. 595\n, 49 S. Ct. 95, 96.\n The patent is for certain new and useful improvements in methods of and apparatus for transporting and treating concrete. The accompanying drawing illustrates the apparatus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n It consists of a chamber 1, for the reception of the material, the lower portion being hopperlike in form, as indicated at 2. The cover 4 is provided with an opening 3, in which there is a door 5. A chain or rope 3a is adapted to be used in partly or entirely closing the door. Air pressure in the chamber also acts to hold this door in closed position. A pressure tank 6 holds compressed air supplied by an air compressor 7, and has a connection 8 leading the air under pressure from the tank to the chamber 1; the air inlet is preferably near the top. An air pipe 10 controlled by a valve 11 also leads into the chamber; the delivery end of this pipe being at or near the discharge or lower end of the hopper.\n The apparatus includes a valve-controlled water supply pipe 12 adapted to deliver water at the lower end of \n\n[282 U.S. 175, 178]\n\u00a0\n the hopper so as to make the mass more easily movable when desired, and also a crook or U-shaped bend 14 in the discharge duct 13.\n The operation as described in the application for patent consists in depositing material in the chamber, closing the door, turning the air from the reservoir through the pipe 8 into the upper portion of the chamber, thus insuring the immediate firm closure of the door and forcing the material in the hopper downward; it being carried along through the conveying tube 13 until it is finally discharged at 15.\n In the application as originally filed it was stated that, owing to the provision of the U-shaped bend in the conveying tube, the material, immediately after leaving the hopper, will be more or less tightly packed; and it is added that 'to loosen the material at the lower end of the hopper should the same become packed, I provide the additional air pipe adapted to discharge air through the material.'\n It should also be remarked that in the original application the invention was described as useful improvements in apparatus for 'elevating and transporting granular and plastic building material, such as sand, plaster, mortar and concrete.'\n The application was filed in the Patent Office on January 14, 1907. Its prosecution was most dilatory. Claims made were repeatedly disallowed, and at one time it lapsed and had to be renewed. Radical changes were mae i n the statement of invention, and radically new claims were made in 1911 and expanded in 1913. The applicant eliminated from the scope of his invention the transportation of granular and plastic material generally, and limited it to the transportation and treatment of concrete; and the patent as issued is so limited. While his original assertion that the compressed air admitted to \n\n[282 U.S. 175, 179]\n\u00a0\n the chamber behind the mass was the propelling force was retained, statements were added and claims were made, ascribing to the air discharged by pipe 10 new action and effect, namely, that it operated to 'engage submasses' or to 'impinge upon successive portions' of the mass of concrete moving through the hopper and discharge duct, and to aid or assist in their movement in the duct, as well as assisting in mixing and mingling the elements of the concrete in the duct, so as to make a more perfect mixture.\n The device alleged in No. 3 to infringe consists of a container, in all material respects like that of the patent, with a discharge duct. It, however, employs no upper air bebind the mass in the container. It has no U-bend in the duct at the outlet of the hopper, nor does it have a pipe terminating in the hopper near the outlet. On the contrary, it has a pipe which discharges compressed air into the duct at the right-angle elbow therein immediately below the outlet of the hopper, thus forcing air into and along the duct in the direction in which the material is to move.\n The device alleged in No. 4 to constitute an infringement is made under the Hackley patent, No. 1,619,297, of date March 1, 1927. It consists of a cylindrical container set horizontally instead of vertically. The door for admission of the concrete is on the top of the apparatus, a funnel-shaped exit is located at one end, the bottom of said funnel being continuous with the lowest portion of the cylinder wall, and the upper portion of the funnel joining a part of the end of the cylinder. Four pipes are led into the cylinder, the first of which discharges into the funnel and the other three at various distances to the rear of the first, along the bottom of the cylinder and in the direction of the funnel. Its method of operation is that, after the cylinder is filled with concrete and \n\n[282 U.S. 175, 180]\n\u00a0\n the door closed, compressed air is discharged through the pipes in order, first, through the one which ends in the funnel, and successively through the others to the rearward until the last one is opened. There is no provision for admission of compressed air on top of or behind the mass as in the McMichael apparatus. Nor is there any trap or U-bend in the delivery duct, which is continuous with the mouth of the funnel and runs in a direct line therefrom.\n If the patent in question were valid as disclosing novelty and invention, we should be bound to analyze the differences of structure and operation above indicated to determine the question of infringement. We have concluded, however, that it does not disclose invention, and that we need not, therefore, narrowly examine the devices and their operation to ascertain whether there is infringement.\n The idea of moving fluids and solids through a pipe by air pressure or other fluid pressure is old, and was well known at the time of the alleged invention. Both granular and plastic materials had been so moved by devices quite similar to that of the patent. These covered a wide range, from lift-pumps for sand and sulphur, to apparatus for transporting muck, spoil, grout, and concrete.\n It is averred, however, that neither an apparatus nor a method such as that devised by McMichael had theretofore been applied to the transportation of concrete. If this be true, its truth must lie in the fact that McMichael either discovered an improvement in apparatus or an improvement in method over the prior art. We think that he did not do so; and we shall call attention to some of the facts which lead us to this conclusion.\n The provision of a hopper-shaped bottom for the cylinder, thus causing the mass of material to onv erge towards the delivery duct, is specified by McMichael as an \n\n[282 U.S. 175, 181]\n\u00a0\n element in his invention. It was old in the art. Warren had employed it in a sand-blast apparatus patented April 2, 1901, No. 671,303. Goldie had used it in a cementing apparatus patented August 26, 1902, No. 707,840. Canniff had shown it in a pneumatic grout mixing and discharging apparatus patented December 10, 1907, No. 873,345. Nor is there any merit in the claim of invention in making the funnel-shaped discharge end of the cylinder connect with the delivery duct smoothly and without offsets.\n The next element to be considered is the introduction of air behind the mass in order to propel it into the discharge duct. This was old in the art. Smith had provided for the employment of such compressed air in an inclosed chamber above the mass in his patent for machinery for laying concrete pavement of January 2, 1872, No. 122,498. Duckham had employed it in an apparatus for discharging muck or spoil (English patent No. 4400, December 18, 1875). Canniff had used it in his patent above referred to, as had McIlvrid in a grout mixing and discharging machine, patent No. 958, 421, Farnham in a sand-blast apparatus patented December 22, 1903, No. 747, 396, and Warren in a similar apparatus in his patent above referred to. Other devices might be cited.\n Much reliance is placed upon the pipe 10, with its end or nozzle in the chamber near the outlet. In his original application, McMichael described its operation somewhat as follows:\n He called attention to the U-bend or trap 14 just below the outlet of the chamber. He stated that this would cause the mass to pack tightly as it was driven down by the upper air pressure, and claimed that the blast of air from the pipe 10 would tend to prevent clogging or arching at this point, thus enabling the material to move more \n\n[282 U.S. 175, 182]\n\u00a0\n freely into the discharge duct. If this be a claim to novelty or invention, it is clearly anticipated by the Duckham English patent above cited. In the device covered by that patent, air is admitted to an air-tight chamber above the mass of muck or spoil to be moved, thus driving it, as in McMichael's, to the outlet. One or more nozzles for the delivery of similar compressed air are placed near the outlet of the chamber, so that the air from them will mingle with and stir up the mass. It is added that a nozzle may also be placed in the discharge pipe for the same purpose, and attention is called to the usefulness of larger nozzles where the material to be moved is clay or similar matter which is likely to harden and form a resistant mass near the outlet of the chamber.\n In the amendment to his specifications, McMichael, while still claiming the function of pipe 10 to be to loosen material at the lower end of the hopper and to assist movement of the mass, added an additional claim, saying that it 'serves the double function of preventing choking in the entrance to the delivery pipe and of supplying air under pressure in sharp jets directly to the delivery pipe itself.' He says that he has found that this supplemental air pipe 10 is very effective in aiding the passage of the material into and through the conveyor pipe. He claims that this second air pipe 'gives to the material the velocity which is needed to carry it to the remote point of delivery.' He explains that the upper pipe supplies air which acts by pressure, and the lower pipe supplies air which acts by velocity. Again he states that the air from this pipe 'may force itself into the body of the mass,' and adds that it 'engages with the submasses to push them along.' He phrases the matter differently by claiming that this air acts upon submasses successively, and claims as a result 'the thorough commingling of the ingredients' with greater rapidity. At considerable length he then elaborates upon the value of the air discharged by this pipe as a mixing agent. \n\n[282 U.S. 175, 183]\n\u00a0\n These specifications and the claims based upon them are particularly important in view of the theory now brought forward-that jets of ar f rom the pipe 10 cut off so-called 'slugs' or portions of the concrete and propel them individually like pistons through the delivery pipe. An examination of the specifications and claims discloses no claim to this slug or pistonlike action of the air so delivered. Any such action is quite inconsistent with the claim that the air from the pipe mingles with the mass and causes additional mixing in the delivery pipe, making the latter a sort of mixing chamber. Unless the slug theory is disclosed in the patent and is a correct theory of operation, it would seem that there is no invention in the use of the pipe 10.\n It is conceded that in the commercial form of the patented apparatus the U-bend is entirectly discarded. It cannot therefore have any useful function, and cannot be the subject of invention. It is further conceded that in the said commercial form pipe 10 is not brought into the chamber and does not terminate in the hopperlike exit. On the contrary, the pipe is led into the elbow in the conduit directly below the hopper and discharges in the direction in which the material is to move. If the function or the pipe is that of a booster or velocity nozzle, as is undoubtedly, amongst other things, claimed in the patent, its use is not invention unless the application of it to concrete is novel and constitutes invention. The use of such nozzles in the conveying of material by compressed air is old in the art. Many of the patents cited and in evidence indicate this, and apart from them it is and must be conceded that such use was not uncommon at the time of McMichael's application.\n Thomas Leake applied for a patent for an apparatus and method for mixing and transporting concrete, October 7, 1907. In this application he showed two nozzles similar to the pipe 10, discharging into the hopper of \n\n[282 U.S. 175, 184]\n\u00a0\n his closed chamber. The District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals found in No. 4 that this invention in fact antedated McMichael's, and we are not prepared to say that the testimony and corroborating documents did not justify this finding. There is considerable evidence tending to show that McMichael recognized the priority of Leake, and, as result, purchased and took an assignment of Leake's patent while his own application was pending, in order to dispose of an interference declared by the Patent Office between them. It resulted that Leake did not offer evidence or press his claim to priority and that the McMichael patent was granted in 1915 and the Leake patent in 1917, and both of them are owned by the same company.\n If there be any virtue in the so-called slug theory, Leake has as clearly disclosed it as McMichael did, although neither of them make this method of operation clear in their specifications and claims.\n It remains to discuss whether there is foundation for the claim that McMichael discovered new principles, namely, that concrete could be moved by compressed air, or that, if it could not be satisfactorily moved by pressure of compressed air or other fluid agent, it could so be moved by a nozzle which cut off portions of the mass and drove them through the delivery duct like pistons.\n Methods and apparatus for moving concrete by compressed air had been proviously invented. See Smith's patent, 122,498. The court below, in No. 3, indicated that this had not been found practicable. There is no support in the record for any such finding, and against it stands the presumption of operability from its patenting. In No. 4 there was uncontradicted evidence that it would work, and that Canniff's grout machine (patent 873, 345) had been successfully used for concrete. Other apparatus closely approximating that of the patent in suit had been used for transporting grout. In his specifications, Mc- \n\n[282 U.S. 175, 185]\n\u00a0\n Michael's only suggestion as to why they were unfit for concrete is that the pipes and parts were not of sufficient size. But obviously a mere change in proportion would involve no more than mechanical skill and would not amount to invention.\n We find no adequate ground for saying tat McMichael's method operated in a novel and useful manner, by reason of the alleged function of the nozzle discharging into the moving mass, cutting off therefrom slugs or pistons of concrete, and driving them forward individually.\n The slug theory, so called, seems to have been advanced for the first time in the Ulen Case, and was there credited and relied upon to sustain the patent. In No. 3 the District Court thought it probable, but the Court of Appeals held the patent valid irrespective of the correctness of the theory.\n In No. 4 the District Court found it incorrect and untenable. This coincides with our own view. The top pressure behind the mass and that coming through the pipe 10 is the same. There is no mechanism to produce sharp spurts or jets of air out of the end of pipe 10. That air, as the patent specifications in certain paragraphs suggest, mingles with the mass of concrete as it comes down through the hopper. It does not cut off masses and drive them forward like pistons, but acts merely by velocity. The evidence is persuasive that the concrete issues from the end of the discharge pipe in a stream or solid flow and not in surges of lumps. It is proved that it freely passes ninety-degree bends in the pipe. In short there is neither theoretical nor practical demonstration of any such phenomenon as the owner of the patent asserts.\n And, even if the mode of operation is as claimed, it is to be remembered that Leake in his application of October 7, 1907, uses the same words to describe the operation of his nozzles as we find McMichael subsequently in- \n\n[282 U.S. 175, 186]\n\u00a0\n serted in his specifications and claims. When this application came into interference with McMichael's, he, of course, became familiar with Leake's claims. It is significant that he then amended his claims, almost in the very words of Leake. This of itself destroys the patent. Chicago & N. W. R. Co. v. Sayles, \n97 U.S. 554\n; General Electric Co. v. Sangamo Electric Co. (C. C. A.) 174 F. 246; Lopulco Systems, Inc., v. Bonnot Co. (C. C. A.) 24 F.(2d) 510.\n For these reasons we find that the patent is invalid. It consists of a combination of elements all of which were old in the art. Its application to the transportation of concrete did not involve invention. Neither the combination of old elements or devices accomplishing no more than an aggregate of old results (Hailes v. Van Wormer, 20 Wall. 353; Office Specialty Mfg. Co. v. Fenton, \n174 \nU.S. 492\n, 19 S. Ct. 641; Grinnell v. Johnson, \n247 \nU.S. 426\n, 38 S. Ct. 547), nor the use of an old apparatus or appliance for a new purpose ( Roberts v. Ryer, \n91 U.S. 150\n), is invention.\n When, in addition, we find that similar combinations had been used for the transportation of granular material, muck and spoil and grout, and that combinations lacking one or another of the old elements of McMichael's had been used to transport concrete, what was said in Concrete Appliances Co. v. Gomery, \n269 \nU.S. 177\n, 46 S. Ct. 42, 43, applies with equal force to these cases:\n'The several elements in the petitioners' claims which we have enumerated embrace familiar devices long in common use, separately or in smaller groups, both in this and in kindred mechanical arts. It is not argued that there is any novelty in such units or groups, and the only serious question presented is whether in combination in the apparatus described, the constitute an invention.'\n\n This court called attention to the fact that the principle of conveying and distributing a mobile substance by \n\n[282 U.S. 175, 187]\n\u00a0\n gravity had been exemplified in various methods for centuries, and that long prior to the patent there is suit the principle had been applied to various substances such as grain, coal, crushed stone, sand, and iron ore, and said:\n'The observations of common experience in the mechanical arts would lead one to expect that, once the feasibility of using 'wet' concrete in building operations was established, the mechanical skill of those familiar wih e ngineering and building problems would seek to make use of known methods and appliances for the convenient handling of this new building material.'\n\n Here it appears that the use of compressed air for conveyance of granular and plastic materials had long been known and practised; so that the cited case is clear authority against invention in the instant cases.\n The decree in No. 3 is reversed and the cause remanded, with instructions to dismiss the bill of complaint. The decree in No. 4 is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","104":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAILROAD COM'N OF WISCONSIN v. MAXCY(1930)\nNo. 301\nArgued: March 6, 1930Decided: March 12, 1930\n\n\n\n Messrs.

Without opinion or findings the court entered a decree April 5, 1929, enjoinin en forcement of the challenged order, as prayed by the bill.

I., for petitioner.\n Messrs. John M. Zane and Alfred T. Carton, both of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent owns a one-sixth interest in several leases executed 1901, 1902, 1903, and 1905, which authorize the lessee to take iron ore from certain Minnesota lands for 25, 45 and 50 years from their respective dates. These leases require payments quarterly of 25 cents royalty per ton upon all ore extracted; provide for minimum annual production and termination under specified circumstances.\n During the year 1917 she received out of such royalties $260,072.30; during 1918, $219,940.43. For 1917 she was allowed $99,561.20 as depletion; for 1918, $84,979.55. Income tax was assessed against her upon the balances and payment exacted. Thereafter she unsuccessfully claimed refunds because the sums allowed for depletion were insufficient. The present suit followed. \n\n[280 U.S. 227, 229]\n\u00a0\n The Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1066, 1067 (approved February 24, 1919), provides:\n'Sec. 214. (a) That in computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions:\n\n'(10) In the case of mines, oil and gas wells, other natural deposits, and timber, a reasonable allowance for depletion and for depreciation of improvements, according to the peculiar conditions in each case, based upon cost including cost of development not otherwise deducted: Provided: That in the case of such properties acquired prior to March 1, 1913, the fair market value of the property (or the taxpayer's interest therein) on that date shall be taken in lieu of cost up to that date: Provided further, That in the case of mines, oil and gas wells, discovered by the taxpayer, on or after March 1, 1913, and not acquired as the result of purchase of a proven tract or lease, where the fair market value of the property is materially disproportionate to the cost, the depletion allowance shall be based upon the fair market value of the property at the date of the discovery, or within thirty days thereafter; such reasonable allowance in all the above cases to be made under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary. In the case of leases the deductions allowed by this paragraph shall be equitably apportioned between the lessor and lessee.'\n\n Section 5, Revenue Act for 1916, c. 463, 39 Stat. 756, 759, is in the margin. 1 Neither party suggests that this dif- \n\n[280 U.S. 227, 230]\n\u00a0\n fers from the corresponding provision in the act of 1918, supra, in any way here material.\n In her claim presented to the tax officer for refund of overpayment for 1917 respondent said:\n'Tax as assessed is based upon income received from royalties from iron ore mines. Depletion amounting to $99,561.20 was allowed to taxpayer, whereas depletion amounting to $203,510.86 should be allowed. The latter amount is the present worth of the ore mined in 1917, as of March 1, 1913, and is arrived at by discounting the amount received in 1917 at 5% of March 1, 1913.'\n\n A like statement appears in her claim concerning overpayment for 1918\n\n\n The declaration has two counts. The first, relating to payments for 1917, alleges:\n'That the value or market price of said ore in the ground untouched and unextracted on March 1, 1913, and on all dates subsequent thereto, exceeded the sum of twenty-five cents per ton, so that every ton of ore paid for under said leases in the year 1917 was disposed of at a price actually less than market prices of the ore, and if then sold free of said lease, would have realized more than twenty-five cents per ton. The actual deple- \n\n[280 U.S. 227, 231]\n\u00a0\n tion of the mines by each ton of ore extracted was more than twenty- five cents when extracted.\n\n'That under the terms of the law the depletion for ore extracted or considered to be extracted was fixed at the market value of the ore in place in the mine at the time and place of extraction, but if such depletion allowance per ton exceeded the amount fixed as the royalty per ton in the lease, the depletion allowance to the plaintiff could not exceed such royalty, but since the royalty when paid included an amount of interest of the payment considered as deferred from March 1, 1913, to the date of actual payment of royalty and the allowance of such depletion in successive years could never exceed the market value of the ore in the mine on March 1, 1913.\n\n'That each payment for ore extracted consisted of two parts, one of which was interest on the deferred payment and the other of which was the actual present worth to the payment deferred from March 1, 1913. Said actual present worth is accurately represented for each ton by that sum which put at interest on March 1, 1913, would produce at the date of payment for ore the royalty paid per ton; to put it in another way, the actual present worth of the ore extracted is accurately ascertained by taking from the royalty per ton paid, the part of the royalty, when and as paid, which represented interest on the deferred payment from March 1, 1913.\n\n'That such an allowance of depletion in successive years and in the year 1917 did not and could not exceed the market value of such ore on March 1, 1913.\n\n'That if of each payment for each ton of ore extracted, the amount of such payment which represents interest on the payment as deferred and actually paid, be figured, the income of the owner will be accurately \n\n[280 U.S. 227, 232]\n\u00a0\n determined as that part of the twenty-five cents, which represents interest.\n\n'That for the year 1917 a correct calculation under the rule above shows that upon the tons of ore extracted and paid for on January 14, 1917, of the payment of 25 per ton $0.2095 was for selling price or principal and $0.0405 was interest on the deferred payments and that on the 330,507 tons extracted the plaintiff was entitled to depletion of $69,251.05; that upon the ore paid for on April 10, 1917, $0.2074 was for selling price or principal and $0.0426 was interest on the deferred payments and that on the 48,958 tons extracted the plaintiff was entitled to depletion of $10,153.29; that on the ore paid for on July 10, 1917, $0.2053 was for selling price or principal and $0.0447 was interest on the deferred payments and that on the 231,090 tons extracted plaintiff was entitled to depletion of $47,434.55; that upon the ore paid for on October 10, 1917, $0.2032 was for selling price or principal and $0.460 was interest on the deferred payments and that on the 432,120 tons extracted the plaintiff was entitled to depletion of $87,791.42; that plaintiff is entitled to depletion amounting for the years 1917 to $214,630.31.'\n\n Count 2 contains similar allegations concerning\n Count 2 contains similar allegations concerning\n In the trial court, after requests by both sides for directed verdict, the respondent had judgment and this was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 30 F.(2d) 369.\n The latter court said:\n'The sole controversy is over the correctness of the government's method of arriving at the value of the iron ore in the ground on March 1, 1913, a matter not covered by the revenue acts in question, nor by any regulation of the Treasury Department.'\n\n This does not accurately state our understanding of the issue. It was necessary for the taxpayer to show the illegality of the exactions. 'The burden of establishing \n\n[280 U.S. 227, 233]\n\u00a0\n that fact rested upon it, in order to show that it was entitled to the deduction which the Commissioner had disallowed, and that the additional tax was to that extent illegally assessed.'

The real point is whether respondent established her claim for refund by adequate evidence And we think she did not.\n On March 1, 1913, she was lessor of mines from which the lessee had the right to extract ore during many years, paying therefor when taken out 25 cents per ton. Her rights were merely to receive the royalties stipulated and to regain possession when the leases terminated. Manifestly, the fair market value of this interest in 1913 was much less than 25 cents per ton of the estimated contents of the mines, but respondent introduced no evidence which tended to show such value. The suggestion that market value per ton on March 1, 1913, was equivalent to the sum which, if then put at simple interest, would have amounted to 25 cents when the ore was actually out and the stipulated royalty became payable, cannot be accepted. This method of estimation would decrease the 1913 market value with the passing of every year. Moreover, it disregards the fact that respondent's interest was in the mines considered as entireties and not in particular parts of ore beds which the lessee had agreed to remove during designated future years.\n Under the statute it became necessary for respondent to establish the fair market value of her interest in the mines on March 1, 1913, or at least that such value was not below what she claimed it was. Otherwise she could not recover. She introduced three witnesses who testified as to ore values. No one of them gave an estimate of the value of her interest at that time. Replying to the question, 'You do not mean to testify that Mrs. Spalding's interest in that ton of ore as of March 1, 1913, or at any \n\n[280 U.S. 227, 234]\n\u00a0\n other time, was worth 25 cents or any other sum?' one of them said: 'That question is based upon Mrs. Spalding's one-sixth ownership of a lease at 25 cents per ton. That question is an entirely different one from the one asked me by Mr. Zane. It would require a good deal of calculation and certain assumptions as to how fast that ore would be shipped. Then it would require discounting against those assumptions to present value. That calculation would take time, and I can not answer that without working it out.' The other two gave no estimate of such value.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed. The cause will be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Mr Justice BUTLER took no part in the consideration or decision of this cause. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See. 5.

Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case raises the same questions as the preceding one, Clarke v. Haberle Crystal Springs Brewing Co., \n280 \nU.S. 384\n, 50 S. Ct. 155, but was decided the other way. Renziehausen v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (C. C. A.) 31 F.(2d) 675. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court on October 14, 1929. \n280 \nU.S. 539\n, 50 S. Ct. 17, 74 L. Ed. -.\n The good will here concerned (treated as embracing trade-marks, trade brands and trade names) was that of a business of distilling and selling whisky, warehousing, and a wholesale liquor business. The Board of Tax Appeals adjudged a deficiency in the petitioner's income tax returns for 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1922. A deduction is \n\n[280 U.S. 387, 389]\n\u00a0\n claimed by him, as in the other case, for exhaustion or obsolescence of the good will, under the Revenue Act of 1918 (Act of February 24, 1919) c. 18,  214(a)(8), 40 Stat. 1057, 1067, using the same words for individuals that are used in section 234 for corporations, and under the Revenue Act of 1921 (Act of November 23, 1921) c. 136,  214(a)(8), 42 Stat. 227, 240, using the same words again. What has been said in the Haberle Crystal Springs Brewing Co.'s Case is sufficient to dispose of this one, and here there is the additional fact that in 1919 the petitioner became aware that he could manufacture whisky for medicinal purposes and did so until the Willis-Campbell Act of November 23, 1921, c. 134, 42 Stat. 222, was passed and the petitioner failed to obtain a permit under it. The evidence does not seem to warrant an alternative claim under the Revenue Act of 1918,  214(a)(4), for losses incurred in business in 1919, even if otherwise it could be sustained.\n The only other question that seems to need mention is raised by an account headed 'Old Whiskey,' on the books of the Large Distilling Company, under which name the petitioner did the distilling business. At the close of each distilling season the whisky manufactured and not sold was charged to this account, matured and sold to the trade. The petitioner regarded this whisky as a personal investment, but the whole business was his, and we agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that the whisky was clearly a part of the stock in trade, and therefore that he was not entitled to the more favorable rate allowed by the Act of November 23, 1921, c. 136,  206( a)(6), 42 Stat. 233, for taxes on capital gain, excluding stock in trade. The petitioner has no reason to complain of the allowance for obsolescence of the warehouses.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice STONE concur in the result. \n\n\n\n","108":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRICHBOURG MOTOR CO. v.

Ed. -, and \n281 \nU.S. 707\n, 50 S. Ct. 237, 74 L. Ed. -, respectively to pass on the question, whether proceedings for the forfeiture of a vehicle seized under section 26 of the National Prohibition Act1, as one used for \n\n[281 U.S. 528, 530]\n\u00a0\n unlawful transportation of intoxicating liquor, but, where there has been no prosecution for that offense, must be had under that section, or whether they may be prosecuted under the provisions of Rev. St.  3450.2 The latter authorizes the forfeiture of vehicles used in the removal or concealment of any commodity with intent to deprive the United States of any tax upon it, which is made a criminal offense. The section does not, as does title 2, section 26 (27 USCA  40) protect the interests of innocent lienors. Goldsmith Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States, \n254 \nU.S. 505\n, 41 S. Ct. 189; cf. Van Oster v. Kansas, \n272 \nU.S. 465\n, 47 S. Ct. 133, 47 A. L. R. 1044\n\n\n In each case the Court of Appeals answered the question by affirming a judgment of a District Court, forfeiting, under section 3450, automobiles in which the petitioners \n\n[281 U.S. 528, 531]\n\u00a0\n respectively, asserted an interest as innocent lienors. Richbourg Motor Co. v. United States (C. C. A. 4th Circuit) 34 F.(2d) 38; Davies Motors v. United States (C. C. A. 9th Circuit) 35 F.(2d) 928. In each a person operating an automobile belonging to another was arrested and arraigned before a United States commissioner on a charge of illegal transportation of intoxicating liquor. The liquor and the car used for its transportation were seized by the officer making the arrest. The United States attorney did not proceed with the prosecution of the charge, but procured the indictment and conviction of the prisoners, under section 3450, for removing and concealing spirits with intent to defraud the government of the tax.\n The proceedings presently involved for the forfeiture of the vehicles were also had under that section. In each the respective petitioners intervened, setting up that they were lienors under conditional contracts of sale, to persons other than those arrested, and that petitioners and the conditional vendees were innocent of any participation in the unlawful acts charged. In No. 452 the court refused a request of petitioner to submit to the jury the question whether the seized automobile was used in the unlawful transportation of liquor and whether the \n\n[281 U.S. 528, 532]\n\u00a0\n persons in the car were arrested at the time of its seizure, and refused a motion to dismiss the libel on the ground that by such arrest and seizure the government was bound to proceed for the forfeiture of the vehicle under title 2, section 26 (27 USCA  40), and barred from proceeding under section 3450 (26 USCA  1181). In No. 569 trial was by the court without a jury, which found the facts as already stated, and decreed forfeiture of the vehicle under section 3450.\n By section 5 of the Willis-Campbell Act of November 23, 1921, c. 134, 42 Stat. 222, 223 (27 USCA  3), all laws relating to the manufacture, taxation, and traffic in intoxicating liquors and penalties for their violation, in force when the National Prohibition Act was adopted, were continued in force, except such provisions as are 'directly in conflict with any provision of the National Prohibition Act.'\n In United States v. One Ford Coupe, \n272 \nU.S. 321\n, 47 S. Ct. 154, 47 A. L. R. 1025, it was held that there was no such direct conflict between section 26 and section 3450 as to preclude the forfeiture of the interest of an innocent lienor under the latter, where the intoxicating liquor was concealed in the seized vehicle with intent to defraud the government of the tax, and where it did not appear that there was transportation of the liquor. In Port Gardner Investment Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 564\n, 47 S. Ct. 165, and in Commercial Credit Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 226\n, 48 S. Ct. 232, it was held that prosecution and conviction of the offender for the transportation of intoxicating liquor under the Prohibition Act barred forfeiture of the seized vehicle under section 3450 (26 USCA  1181), since the disposition of the vehicle after the conviction, prescribed by title 2, section 26 (27 USCA  40), is mandatory. These cases left undetermined the question now presented, whether, under title 2,  26, the mere arrest of the person discovered in the act of transportation, and the seizure of the transporting vehicle, bar the forfeiture under section 3450 ( 26 USCA  1181).\n The language of title 2,  26 (27 USCA  40) is in form mandatory throughout. It is made the 'duty' of the officer discovering any per- \n\n[281 U.S. 528, 533]\n\u00a0\n son in the act of transporting liquor to seize the liquor, when 'he shall take possession of the vehicle' and 'shall arrest any person in charge' of it. He 'shall at once proceed against the person arrested under the provisions of this chapter.' The vehicle 'shall be returned to the owner' upon his giving bond. 'The court upon conviction of the person so arrested ... shall order a sale by public auction of the property seized,' and the officer making the sale 'shall pay all liens ... which are established ... as being bona fide and as having been created without the lienor having any notice that the carrying vehicle was being used or was to be used for illegal transportation of liquor. ...' It is plain that, whenever the vehicle seized by the arresting officers is discovered in use in the prohibited transportation, literal compliance with these requirements would compel the forfeiture under title 2,  26, with the consequent protection of the interests of innocent lienors. To that extent, title 2,  26, if interpreted to exact such compliance, is in direct conflict with the forfeiture provisions of section 3450 and supersedes them whenever any person within the provisions of title 2,  26, is discovered 'in the act of transporting ... intoxicating liquors in any ... vehicle,' which liquor is 'removed ... deposited or concealed ... with intent to defraud the United States' of the tax.\n But the government contends that title 2,  26, is not to be read thus literally; that it was not intended by its mandatory phrases to do more than state generally the duty resting on all law enforcement officers to enforce the law, but which leaves them free, when the same act or transaction constitutes an offense under different statutes, to proceed under either one. It is argued that title 2,  26, could not have been intended to preclude district attorneys from prosecuting violations of section 3450 merely because they involve transportation, and it can no less be taken to de- \n\n[281 U.S. 528, 534]\n\u00a0\n prive them of their election to forfeit the offending vehicle under either section.\n Undoubtedly, 'shall' is sometimes the equivalent of 'may' when used in a statute prospectively affecting government action. See Cairo & F. R. Co. v. Hecht, \n95 U.S. 168\n; West Wisconsin Ry. Co. v. Foley, \n94 U.S. 100\n, 103. The usual provisions of criminal statutes that the offender 'shall' be punished as the statute prescribes is not necessarily to be taken, as against the government, to direct prosecution under that rather than some other applicable statute.\n But the prescription in detail, by title 2,  26 (27 USCA  40), whenever transportation is involved, of successive steps to be taken, which, if followed, lead unavoidably to forfeiture under that section and no other, with the important consequence of protecting the interests of innocent third persons, suggests a definite purpose to make the protection effective by bringing all forefeitures in such cases under its controlling provisions. If the purpose were the more general one of imposing on government officers the general duty to procure the forfeiture at their election, either under title 2,  26, or any other applicable statute, most of the requirements of title 2,  26, might have been omitted. The end sought could have been attained more easily by the simple enactment, in the language of section 3450 (26 USCA  1181), that the offending vehicle 'shall be forfeited,' saving the rights of innocent lienors if the proceeding were had under title 2,  26.\n It is to be observed that title 2,  26, neither prohibits transportation of intoxicating liquors nor prescribes the punishment of the offender. That is provided for in title 2, section 3 (27 USCA  12) and  29 (27 USCA  46), as amended by the Jones Act (45 Stat. 1446 (27 USCA  91, 92)). The general duty of investigating and reporting violations of title 2, section 3, as well as other sections of the National Prohibition Act to United States Attorneys, is imposed on all prohibition officers by title 2,  2 and 29. That duty is mandatory. Donnelley v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 505\n, 48 S. Ct. 400. The general \n\n[281 U.S. 528, 535]\n\u00a0\n duty to prosecute all criminal offenses is imposed on district attorneys by Rev. St.  771 (28 USCA  485). The objective of title 2,  26, is not the prosecution of the offender, elsewhere provided for, but the confiscation of the seized liquor and the forfeiture of vehicles used in its transportation, to the limited extent specified in the section. Every act which it enjoins on public officials is directed to that end.\n In providing for forfeitures under this section Congress was not unaware that the enactment of the National Prohibition Act would enormously increase seizures of vehicles, beyond those made under section 3450 (26 USCA  1181), and that their forfeiture would place an increased and heavy burden on many innocent persons, unless afforded some protection by the new legislation. By title 2,  26 (27 USCA  40), it gave such protection in all cases where the prosecution of the person guilty of the transportation is had under the National Prohibition Act. This would have been but an idle gesture, and the congressional purpose would have been defeated if, in practically every case where the transporting vehicle is seized, the prosecuting officers could compel forfeiture of the interests of innocent third persons under section 3450 (26 USCA  1181). Yet that is the effect of the construction of title 2,  26, contended for by the government, since, with the enactment of national prohibition, there can be few cases of illegal transportation which do not involve the concealment of nontax-paid liquor. See United States v. One Ford Coupe , supra, page 326 of 272 U. S., 47 S. Ct. 154, 47 A. L. R. 1025.\n We think that Congress did not take the precaution to enact the carefully chosen language of section 26 merely to impose general duties on prosecuting officers already placed on them by other sections of the act, but that its purpose was to preclude the nullification of the protection which section 26 had extended to innocent third persons.\n This Court has already held that the provision in section 26 that 'the court upon conviction of the person so \n\n[281 U.S. 528, 536]\n\u00a0\n arrested shall ... order a sale by public auction of the property seized' is mandatory and requires the forfeiture to proceed under that section. Port Gardner Investment Co. v. United States, supra; Commercial Credit Co. v. United States, supra. No tenable ground of distinction it suggested which would enable us to say, where forfeiture is involved, that the preceding requirement of the section, that the proceedings against the person arrested 'shall be under the provisions of this title,' is any less so.\n The conclusion we reach is not without support in the legislative history of title 2,  26. The clause protecting the interests of innocent lienors was added by amendment in the House of Representatives to H. R. 6810, which became the National Prohibition Act. The sponsor for the amendment pointed out that the procedure prescribed by the section as originally drawn protected the interests of the innocent owner, and stated that the amendment was designed to save from forfeiture the interests of innocent lienors and innocent owners alike. Congressional Record, 66th Cong., 1st Sess., vol. 58, pt. 3, p. 2902, July 19, 1919.\n Report No. 151 of the Senate Judiciary Committee on this bill, August 18, 1919, 66th Cong., 1st Sess., stated that the 'Seizure of any vehicle in which liquor is being transported in violation of law, together with liquor being transported, is authorized, as well as the arrest of the person engaged in such illegal transaction, the property seized to be disposed of under the direction of the court, as provided in  26.'\n We are of opinion that under title 2,  26 (27 USCA  40), it is the duty of prohibition officers to arrest any person discovered in the act of transportation and to seize the transporting vehicle; that such arrest and seizure require the government to proceed for forfeiture of the vehicle under title 2,  26. It is unnecessary to say whether, if for any reason the seizure \n\n[281 U.S. 528, 537]\n\u00a0\n cannot be made or the forfeiture proceeded with, prosecution for any offense committed must be had under the National Prohibition Act rather than other statutory provisions.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 26, Title 2, of the National Prohibition Act, c. 85, 41 Stat. 305, 315 (U.

Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n[282 U.S. 25, 28]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here on a certificate of questions of law from the judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Subsequently the entire record was brought up, but the facts sufficiently appear in the certificate and both they and the questions may be abbreviated here. The suit is brought by the United States against the appellants by name, described as 'constituting the Board of State Harbor Commissioners of the State of California, operating The State Belt Railroad,' to recover penalties for alleged breaches of the Safety Appliance Acts. Acts March 2, 1893, c. 196, 27 Stat. 531, April 1, 1896, c. 87, 29 Stat. 85, March 2, 1903, c. 976, 32 Stat. 943, and April 14, 1910, c. \n\n[282 U.S. 25, 29]\n\u00a0\n 160, 36 Stat. 298 (U. S. Code, tit. 45,  1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 16 (45 USCA  1, 2, 6, 8, 11-13, 16)). The penalties are imposed upon 'any common carrier engaged in interstate commerce by railroad,' and the broad question is whether the defendants are liable under the Acts.\n The matters complained of occurred upon what is known as the State Belt Railroad. The road is about five miles long, within the City of San Francisco, runs nearly parallel with the water front of the harbor, and connects many industrial plants and the line of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company with wharves belonging to the State and through the wharves with other common carriers engaged in interstate commerce by railroad. It may be assumed that the work done upon the Belt Line was interstate commerce. But the line belongs to and is operated by the State; the work is done without profit for the purpose of facilitating the commerce of the port, and the funds received after paying expenses go to the Treasury of the State to the credit of the San Francisco Harbor Improvement Fund. California has not gone into business generally as a common carrier, but simply has constructed the Belt Line as an incident of its control of the harbor-a State prerogative. Cal. Political Code,  2524. The defendants are officers of the State charged with the administration of the Harbor of San Francisco and of the State Belt Railroad in connection therewith. They had no hand in or knowledge of the alleged violations of law, the immediate supervision being the duty of an inspector appointed by them, and his subordinates being Civil Service employees of the State.\n On these facts in our opinion the statute, if it applies to anyone, can apply only to the State. The suit is not to recover damages for a tort, which, if a wrong on the part of the master is at least equally a wrong on the part of the servant who personally is guilty of the act or omission that caused the harm. Here the suit is for a penalty attached to an offence-and the only party on whom the \n\n[282 U.S. 25, 30]\n\u00a0\n liability is imposed is the common carrier. The statute is not like the Hours of Service Act of March 4, 1907, c. 2939,  3, 34 Stat. 1415 (U. S. Code, title 45,  63 (45 USCA  63)); that in terms extends the liability to officers and agents. It seems to us plain that as between the Board of Harbor Commissioners and California the carrier here is the State, by which it is agreed that the Road was owned and operated, which received such pay as was required for the work that was done, and which did the work for the purpose of facilitating the commerce of its principal port. The principal and its agents cannot both be the common carriers aimed at. One is and the other is not subjected to the penalty. One is superior the other inferior. The superior is the one that operated the road and the one whose commands the others were bound to obey.\n The suit is brought against the appellants individually. This is conceded by the Government and sufficiently appears from the declaration and from the judgment against them by name, entered after they had ceased to be members of the Board. Manifestly if we are right in what we have said the judgment is wrong and we are relieved from the duty of considering whether the Safety Appliance Act should be construed to embrace the State.\n An answer to other questions proposed is Unnecessary because of our conclusion that the judgment against the defendants cannot be sustained.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMITH v. ILLINOIS BELL TELEPHONE CO.(1930)\nNo. 90\nArgued: Decided: December 1, 1930\n\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 133, 136]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George I. Haight, Benjamin F. Goldstein, Oscar E. Carlstrom, and Samuel A. Ettelson, all of Chicago, Ill., for appellants.\n Mr. William D. Bangs, of Chicago, Ill., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a final decree of the District Court, composed of three judges as required by section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380), enjoining the enforcement of an order of the Illinois Commerce Commission which prescribed rates for telephone service in the city of Chicago, upon the ground that the order was confiscatory and hence was in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 38 F.(2d) 77. The order of the Commission was made on August 16, 1923, to be effective October 1, 1923. It reduced rates for four classes of coin box service and thus applied to a large part of the intrastate service of the complainant, the Illinois Bell Telephone Company.\n An interlocutory injunction, restraining the enforcement of the rates, was granted on December 21, 1923, and the order was affirmed by this Court on October 19, 1925. \n269 \nU.S. 531\n, 46 S. Ct. 22. This interlocutory order was made upon the condition that, if the injunction were dissolved, the complainant should refund to its subscribers the amounts paid by them in excess of the sums chargeable under the Commission's order. The suit was not brought to a final hearing until April, 1929, and the court found that at the time of its decision (January 31, 1930) the amount thus reserved for refunds exceeded $11,000,000. The court said that the delay in bringing the case to trial was attributable to the city of Chicago and that the complainant had been ready at all times to proceed. But the decree enjoining the rates speaks from its date, and the question is necessarily presented, not only whether the order of the Commission was confiscatory when made, but also as to its validity during the period that has intervened, and as to the respective rights of the complainant and its subscribers in relation to the fund thus accumulated. Groes-\n\n\n[282 U.S. 133, 143]\n\u00a0\n beck v. Duluth, South Shore & Atlantic Railway Co., \n250 \nU.S. 607, 609\n, 40 S. Ct. 38\n\n\n The court found that 99 per cent. of the stock of the complainant, the Illinois Company, is owned by the American Telephone & Telegraph Company, which also owns substantially the same proportion of the stock of the Western Electric Company; that the Illinois and American companies unite in rendering long distance service under an arrangement for a division of tolls; that at the time to which the inquiry related, in October, 1923, there was in effect an agreement by which the Illinois Company paid to the American Company 4 1\/2 per cent. of its gross revenues for rent of instruments and as compensation for engineering, executive, financial and other services; that a large part of the materials entering into the construction of the plant and equipment of the Illinois Company were purchased from the Western Electric Company and much of its operating expense consisted of payments made under a contract with that company for apparatus and supplies. The courtfur ther found that the American Company owned a controlling interest in fifteen telephone companies which, in connection with other companies controlled by those subsidiaries and some companies in which its interest was not controlling, were operated as a system with the avowed purpose of rendering a nation-wide and unified telephone service; that the American Company had stated that 'the associated companies are specialists in local service problems, with local operating forces, identified and familiar with the needs of the communities they serve'; that 'the parent company undertakes the solution of the problems that are common to all,' and in this way there was provided a central authority equipped to perform adequately general functions, leaving to the local companies responsibility for local affairs.\n Upon these facts the city attacked the standing of the Illinois Company as the real plaintiff in the case. The \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 144]\n\u00a0\n court overruled this contention, holding that the ownership of stock by the American Company, and its power to control the Illinois Company, did not destroy the distinct corporate identity of the Illinois Company. The court pointed out that the order of the Commission was directed against the Illinois Company, and that it was treated as a corporation for the purpose of compelling it to establish the prescribed rates for service furnished by the operation of the property to which it had legal title. No ground appears for assailing this ruling. The fact that the relation of the Illinois Company to the American Company may demand close scrutiny, in dealing with certain questions which bear upon the validity of the rate order, cannot obscure the essential basis of that order, that is, that the Commission was imposing its requirement upon a corporate organization engaged in an intrastate public service and, as such, amenable to a valid exercise of the Commission's authority.\n The Commission, in its final order of August, 16, 1923, made the following findings with respect to the value of the property of the Illinois Company: That the original cost as of December 31, 1922, of the property used and useful in the rendering of telephone service in the city of Chicago and exclusive of working capital, materials and supplies, work in progress and going value, but including overhead, was $90,687,816; that the reproduction cost new of that property, with the same exceptions, was $ 128,769,000; that the property as it then existed was 'in at least 90 per cent condition'; that the amount of construction work then in progress, which would eventually be included in capital account, was not more than $ 4,250,000; that the amount necessary to provide a sufficient cash working capital and to permit the carrying of sufficient materials and supplies was $3,000,000; that the going value of the Chicago property of the Illinois Company was $4,196,872; that the Chicago division of the Illinois \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 145]\n\u00a0\n Company had a depreciation reserve of $26,000,000, which had been contributed by the subscribers of the company and had been used by the company for extensions and additions to its property, and that these extensions and additions should not be considered in arriving at a base upon which to compute rates for telephone service; and that the fair rate- making base for the Chicago property of the Illinois Company, 'including physical property, overhead, working capital, going value and work in progress' as thus found, was $96,000,000, which was 'exclusive of the $26, 000,000 of money taken for depreciation reserve and put into plant and equipment.' The Commission also found that on a readjustment of the account of operating expenses, and on making a fair allowance to take care of maintenance and retirement charges, the existing rates, if permitted to remain in effect for the ensuing year (1923), would afford a return of 9 per cent. upon the rate-base above stated; that this was an excessive rate and that the reduced rates prescribed by the Commission would enable the company to obtain a return of 7 1\/2 per cent. upon that rate base.\n The court found that the original cost of the property, taking the Commission's finding of cost as of December 31, 1922, with net additions to June 30, 1923, was $101,626,014; that the reproduction cost new, as of the latter date, was at least $145,000,000; that the finding that the property was in 90 per cent. condition was supported by the evidence, and that on this basis the reproduction cost new, less depreciation, was $130, 500,000; that the amount allowed by the Commission, $4,196,067, was the minimum allowance that could be made for going value; that the valuation, or rate basis, of $96,000,000, found by the Commission as of December 31, 1922, or $106,000,000 if the net additions to June 30, 1923, were added, was clearly insufficient; and that the valuation should be not less than $ 125,000,000, estimating the depreciation at 10 per cent. \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 146]\n\u00a0\n The court held that the exclusion from the rate base of extensions and additions to the amount of $26,000,000, for which payment had been made from the company's depreciation reserve, was erroneous; that the customers had paid for service, not for the property used to render it; that in paying for service they had not acquired any interest in the property of the company; and that profits of the past could not be used to sustain confiscatory rates for the future, citing Board of Public Utility Commissioners v. New York Telephone Co., \n271 \nU.S. 23, 31\n, 32 S., 46 S. Ct. 363.\n The court further found that the readjustment made by the Commission of the company's account of operating expenses involved a reduction of $ 360,000 from the payment made to the American Company under the license contract, and a reduction of $1,800,000 from the annual allowance for depreciation; that the amount available for return in 1923 on the value of the property under the rates in force was $6,280,000; that if to this amount were added the above deductions on the license contract and for depreciation, there would have been available for such return the sum of $ 8,440,000; that the reduction for the entire year under the rates established by the Commission would have been $1,700,000, thus leaving a return of $6,740,000, or less than 5 1\/2 per cent., which was held to be confiscatory under conditions existing in 1923.\n At the threshold of the discussion, we are met with the fact that, in these findings, the Commission and the court made no distinction between the intrastate and the interstate property and business of the company. It appears that the property of the company in Chicago is used to render (1) what is called exchange service, all of which is intrastate, (2) intrastate toll service over its own lines and under arrangements with companies other than the American Company, and (3) interstate toll serv- \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 147]\n\u00a0\n ice, which includes all the toll service rendered under arrangements with the American Company. The company introduced evidence separating the intrastate and interstate business and also the intrastate exchange business. While the court regarded these computations as correct, and approved the method in which they had been made, still the court made no specific findings based on a separation of the intrastate and interstate property, revenues and expenses, but determined the issue on the basis of the total Chicago property of the company.\n The court stated that this was done because that basis was less favorable to the company than that of its total intrastate property or of its intrastate exchange property. In support of this view, the court said that according to the computations of the company, one-half of one per cent. of calls originated by subscribers resulted in interstate toll calls; that 3.62 per cent. of the company's property in Chicago was used in furnishing interstate toll service, and 2.54 per cent. of its property was used in furnishing intrastate toll service; that both on the reproduction cost new, as claimed by the company, and on the original cost, the percentag of return was greater for the total Chicago business than for the total intrastate business; and that the return for the latter was greater than for the intrastate exchange business. Considering that the difference would not affect the result, the court deemed it to be more convenient to pass upon the order of the Commission without recasting the figures in order to make allowance for interstate or intrastate toll property and earnings.\n The appellants challenge this conclusion. \n1\n They insist that the American Company used in its long distance service, without properly reimbursing the Illinois Company, the Chicago local exchange plant, and other facili- \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 148]\n\u00a0\n ties of the latter company, and that the additional net income to which the Illinois Company was properly entitled in connection with the long distance service, or that suitably taking into account the value of the property used and the expenses incurred in the long distance service and not deducted from the Chicago property and expenses, would affect the result. It is apparent that this contention can not be dismissed simply on the basis of the number of interstate calls originated by subscribers of the Illinois Company in Chicago, without considering other factors of time and labor entering into the relative use. Nor can the question be disregarded by assuming a rate of return from the total Chicago business as compared with a rate of return from the intrastate business or the intrastate exchange business, as such an assumption would beg the point in issue.\n The separation of the intrastate and interstate property, revenues and expenses of the company is important not simply as a theoretical allocation to two branches of the business. It is essential to the appropriate recognition of the competent governmental authority in each field of regulation. In disregarding the distinction between the interstate and intrastate business of the company, the court found it necessary to pass upon the fairness of the division of interstate tolls between the American and Illinois companies. The court held that the division was reasonable and the appellants contest this ruling. But the interstate tolls are the rates applicable to interstate commerce, and neither these interstate rates nor the division of the revenue arising from interstate rates was a matter for the determination either of the Illinois Commission or of the court in dealing with the order of that Commission. The Commission would have had no authority to impose intrastate rates, if as such they would be confiscatory, on the theory that the interstate revenue of the company was too small and could be increased to \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 149]\n\u00a0\n make good the loss. The interstate service of the Illinois Company, as well as that of the American Company, is subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, which has been empowered to pass upon the rates, charges, and practices relating to that service. Interstate Commerce Act,  1(1)(c), (3), (5); section 15(1); section 20(5), 49 USCA  1(1)(c), (3), (5), section 15(1), and section 20(5). In the exercise of this jurisdiction, the Interstate Commerce Commission has authority to estimate the value of the property used in the interstate service and to determine the amount of the revenues and the expenses properly attributable thereto. By section 20(5) of the Interstate Commerce Act, that Commission is also charged with the duty of prescribing, as soon as practicable, the classes of property for which depreciation charges may properly be included in operating expenses, and the percentages of depreciation which shall be charged with respect to each of such classes of property. The proper regulation of rates can be had only by maintaining the limits of state and federal jurisdiction, and this cannot be accomplished unless there are findings of fact underlying the conclusions reached with respect to the exercise of each authority. In view of the questions presented in this case, the validity of the order of the state commission can be suitably tested only by an appropriate determination of the value of the property employed in the intrastate business and of the compensation receivable for the intrastate service under the rates prescribed. Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 435\n, 33 S. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18. As to the value of that property, and as to the revenue and expenses incident to that business, separately considered, there should be specific findings. Railroad Commission v. Maxcy, \n281 \nU.S. 82, 83\n, 50 S. Ct. 228.\n The court found that the Illinois Company owns and operates all the property in the city of Chicago used in interstate calls and connects with the property owned by \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 150]\n\u00a0\n the American Company at the city limits. In the method used by the Illinois Company in separating its interstate and intrastate business, for the purpose of the computations which were submitted to the court, what is called exchange property, that is, the property used at the subscriber's station and from that station to the toll switchboard, or to the toll trunk lines was attributed entirely to the intrastate service. This method was adopted as a matter of convenience, in view of the practical difficulty of dividing the property between the interstate and intrastate services. \n2\n The appellants insist that this method is erroneous, and they point to the indisputable fact that the subscriber's station, and the other facilities of the Illinois Company which are used in connecting with the long distance toll board, are employed in the interstate transmission and reception of messages. \n3\n While the difficulty in making an exact apportionment of the property is apparent, and extreme nicety is not required, only reasonable measures being essential (Rowland v. Boyle, \n244 \nU.S. 106, 108\n, 37 S. C.t 577; Groesbeck v. Duluth, South Shore & Atlantic Railway, \n250 \nU.S. 607, 614\n, 40 S. Ct. 38 ), it is quite another \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 151]\n\u00a0\n matter to ignore altogether the actual uses to which the property is put. It is obvious that, unless an apportionment is made, the intrastate service to which the exchange property is allocated will bear an undue burden-to what extent is a matter of controversy. \n4\n We think that this subject requires further consideration, to the end that by some practical method the different uses of the property may be recognized and the return properly attributable to the intrastate service may be ascertained accordingly.\n Other questions are presented growing out of the relation of the Illinois Company to the Western Electric Company and to the American Company. While the Illinois Company is a distinct corporate organization, it has the advantage of being a component part of a large system to which the benefits of its operations accrue. Through this relation the Illinois Company obtains the co-operation of the manufacturing, research, engineering, and financing departments of the American Company. This does not alter the fact that the Illinois business is to be treated as a segregated enterprise. If a single individual or corporation, having a number of technical staffs, engaged directly in local public services within several States, each State would be entitled to regulate the transactions within its own domain according to its own conception of public pol- \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 152]\n\u00a0\n icy, provided there were no infringement of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, and, if the latter were invoked by reason of the action of any State, it would still be necessary to consider the local enterprise separately and to make whatever apportionments were necessary in that view. The corporate organization of the Illinois Company not only created a legal person amenable as such to governmental authority, but facilitates the examination of the particular transactions subject to that authority. The question presented in the present case is not one of the abuse of intercorporate relations, or of domination or control affecting the integrity of the direction of the affairs of the Illinois Company, but of alleged confiscation through prescribed intrastate rates.\n Contentions of the appellants in this relation are directed to the purchases from the Western Electric Company and to the payments to the American Company under what is called its 'license contract.' It appears that the Illinois Company has purchased practically all its equipment from the Western Electric Company. The state commission in laying the basis for its rate order made no finding as to the fairness of the prices on such purchases. On the record in this suit, the court concluded that the city had failed to support its contention that these prices were exorbitant. The court said that it appeared that for the past fourteen years the average profit of the Western Electric Company on its total business had not been 'in excess of seven per cent. and never above ten per cent.' That fact has evidentiary value, but the finding does not go far enough. The Western Electric Company not only manufactured apparatus for the licensees of the Bell system but engaged in other large operations and it cannot be merely assumed or conjectured that the net earnings on the entire business represent the net earnings \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 153]\n\u00a0\n from the sales to the Bell licensees generally or from those to the Illinois Company. Nor is the argument of the appellants answered by a mere comparison of the prices charged by the Western Electric Company to the Illinois Company with the higher prices charged by other manufacturers for comparable material, or by the Western Electric Company to independent telephone companies. The point of the appellants' contention is that the Western Electric Company, through the organization and control of the American Company, occupied a special position with particular advantages in relation to the manufacture and sale of equipment to the licensees of the Bell system, including the Illinois Company, that is, that it was virtually the manufacturing department for that system, and the question is as to the net earnings of the Western Electric Company realized in that department and the extent to which, if at all, such profit figures in the estimates upon which the charge of confiscation is predicated. We think that there should be findings upon this point.\n At the time to which the evidence was primarily directed (1923), there was in force a 'license contract' between the Illinois Company and the American Company, granting a license under the patents owned or controlled by the American Company and providing for the payment to the latter of 4 1\/2 per cent. of the gross revenues of the Illinois Company covering the rental for the use of instruments and for engineering, financial and advisory services. The total amount sought to be charged by the Illinois Company to operating expenses, in 1923, for payments under this contract in relation to the Chicago business was about $1,724,000. The order of the Public Utilities Commission of Illinois, made in December, 1920, which fixed the rates charged in 1923 (the rates still in force under the interlocutory injunction in \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 154]\n\u00a0\n this suit), had provided that an allowance of.$1.13 was reasonable solely for the use of each telephone instrument, that the services of the American Company were of great value to the Illinois Company, that the annual payment under the license contract then averaged $2.10 per station for the city of Chicago, and that this payment was not excessive. \n5\n The Illinois Commerce Commission, in the order now under attack, continued this allowance of \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 155]\n\u00a0\n $2.10 per station as sufficient to cover the rental and the services in question. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The Illinois Company, in its evidence before the court, presented an estimate showing that it would have cost that company the sum of $709,000, or $1.07 per station during the year 1923 to provide its own supply of instruments, purchasing them in the open market and providing for a return of 8 per cent. on the investment. The appellants urge that this amount is too large by $120,000, and that, in any event, the remainder of the total charge of $1,724,000 for payments under the license contract, that is, $1, 015,000, treating this amount as compensation for services in addition to rentals, should be rejected. The court overruled this contention. The court found that the case for the allowance of the entire amount for services was a strong one; that on the basis of a total charge of $2.10 per station, as allowed by the state commission, there would be a reduction of $360,000 in the amount chargeable to operating expenses by virtue of the payments under the license contract; and that there was \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 156]\n\u00a0\n no warrant for any further reduction. Without approving the reduction, the court accepted the ruling of the Commission for the purpose of determining the issue of confiscation.\n It further appears that in the early part of the year 1926, the payment under the license contract was reduced from 4 1\/2 per cent. of the gross earnings to 4 per cent. This reduction was made effective as of January 1, 1926, and the reduced rate was applied in the years 1926 and 1927.7 At the end of the year 1927, the conditions of the license contract were again changed by providing for the sale by the American Company to the Illinois Company of the telephone instruments (receivers, transmitters, and induction coils), and the American Company was relieved from its obligation with respect to their replacement and repair. It is said that the price paid was substantially the current price less 20 per cent. At the same time the payment under the license contract by the Illinois Company to the American Company was reduced from 4 per cent. to 2 per cent. of the gross earnings. \n8\n On January 1, 1929, the \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 157]\n\u00a0\n rate of payment was further reduced from 2 per cent. to 1 1\/2 per cent. of the gross earnings.\n There is evidence that the payment under the license contract in the year 1924 exceeded the amount allowed by the state commission by $358,952; in 1925, by $387,284; in 1926, by $223,249; and in 1927, by $251,964. We find no similar statement for the subsequent period under the reductions of rate then applicable. In view of the findings, both of the state commissions and of the court, we see no reason to doubt that valuable services were rendered by the American Company, but there should be specific findings by the statutory court with regard to the cost of these services to the American Company and the reasonable amount which should be allocated in this respect to the operating expenses of the intrastate business of the Illinois Company in the years covered by the decree.\n There is also the question of the annual allowance for depreciation. The Illinois Commission concluded that the accumulation of a large reserve ($26,000,000), despite the fact that the property had been maintained 'in at least 90 per cent. condition,' showed that the reserve had been built up by annual additions that were in excess of the amounts required. The Commission by its order pro- \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 158]\n\u00a0\n vided for a 'combined maintenance and replacement allowance' which it deemed to be adequate 'to fully protect the investment in this property and permit the Company to accrue a reserve in the anticipation of property retirements.' The court found that by this method the amount as charged by the company to operating expenses in 1923 with respect to depreciation had been reduced by the Commission to the extent of about $1,800,000. It was on the assumption of this reduction that the court, without making any finding as to the proper annual allowance for depreciation, reached its conclusion as to the inadequacy of the rates.\n While it has been held by this Court that property paid for out of moneys received for past services belongs to the company, and that the property represented by the credit balance in the reserve for depreciation cannot be used to support the imposition of a confiscatory rate (Board of Commissioners v. New York Telephone Co., supra), it is evident that past experience is an indication of the company's requirements for the future. The recognition of the ownership of the property represented by the reserve does not make it necessary to allow similar accumulations to go on if experience shows that these are excessive. The experience of the Illinois Company, together with a careful analysis of the results shown, under comparable conditions, by other companies which are part of the Bell system, and thus enjoy the advantage of the continuous and expert supervision of a central technical organization,9 should afford a sound basis for judgment as to the amount which in fairness \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 159]\n\u00a0\n both to public and private interest should be allowed as an annual charge for depreciation. The company urges that, as Congress has granted jurisdiction to the Interstate Commerce Commission over the depreciation rates of telephone companies doing an interstate business (Interstate Commerce Act, section 20(5), as amended by Transportation Act 1920,  435, 49 USCA  20(5), this subject is now completely withdrawn from the power of the State. It is said that two rates of depreciation cannot be charged on the same property. The interstate Commerce Commission has had the matter under consideration ( Telephone and Railroad Depreciation Charges, 118 I. C. C. 328-333), but, so far as we are advised, a final determination has not yet been made. The Interstate Commerce Commission has its accounting rules with reference to depreciation charges and, pending its order under section 20(5) of the Interstate Commerce Act, telephone companies, as well as others subject to the act, have been directed to continue to observe these requirements. The company argues that, although the Interstate Commerce Commission has not finally ruled, the action taken by Congress excludes the jurisdiction of state tribunals under familiar principles. Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Washington, \n222 \nU.S. 370, 378\n, 32 S. Ct. 160; Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n250 \nU.S. 566, 569\n, 40 S. Ct. 36; Oregon-Washington Railroad & Navigation Co. v. Washington, \n270 \nU.S. 87, 102\n, 46 S. Ct. 279. We are unable to assent to this view. As the Interstate Commerce Commission has not acted finally in the matter, we are not now called upon to consider the scope of its authority in relation to depreciation charges, but we are of the opinion that, in any event, until action has been \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 160]\n\u00a0\n taken which could be deemed validly to affect the amount to be charged to depreciation in connection with intrastate business so as to affect intrastate rates, the prerogative of the State to prescribe such rates, and the jurisdiction and duty of the statutory court in considering their validity to determine the amount properly allowable for depreciation in connection with the intrastate business, are not to be gainsaid. Compare Board of Commissioners v. Great Northern Railway Co., \n281 \nU.S. 412\n, 50 S. Ct. 391. Accordingly, the court should make appropriate findings with respect to the amount to be allowed in this case as an annual charge for depreciation in connection with the intrastate business.\n Upon the hypotheses adopted by the statutory court, the return to the Illinois Company was found to be inadequate, but what would be a proper rate of return was not determined. In determining what is a confiscatory regulation of rates, it is necessary to consider the actual effect of the rates imposed in the light of the utility's situation, its requirements and opportunities. As was said in United Railways v. West, \n280 \nU.S. 234, 249\n, 250 S., 50 S. Ct. 123, 125, a rule as to rate of return cannot be laid down which would apply uniformly to all sorts of utilities; 'what may be a fair return for one may be inadequate for another, depending upon circumstances, locality, and risk.' In that case the Court restated the general rule in the language of the opinion in Bluefield Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 679, 692\n, 693 S., 43 S. Ct. 675, 679, as follows: 'What annual rate will constitute just compensation depends upon many circumstances, and must be determined by the exercise of a fair and enlightened judgment, having regard to all relevant facts. A public utility is entitled to such rates as will permit it to earn a return on the value of the property which it employs for the convenience of the public equal to that generally being made at the same time and in the same general part of the country \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 161]\n\u00a0\n on investments in other business undertakings which are attended by corresponding risks and uncertainties; but it has no constitutional right to profits such as are realized or anticipated in highly profitable enterprises or speculative ventures. The return should be reasonably sufficient to assure confidence in the financial soundness of the utility and should be adequate, under efficient and economical management, to maintain and support its credit and enable it to raise the money necessary for the proper discharge of its public duties.'\n It is evident that in the present case we are not dealing with an ordinary public utility company, but with one that is part of a large system organized for the purpose of maintaining the credit of the constituent companies and securing their efficient and economical management. The record of the Illinois Company shows that for many years it has been able to expand its business so as to meet increasing demands, to pay its operating expenses including interest on money borrowed, to pay dividends of 8 per cent, upon its capital stock, and to accumulate a surplus. It was found by the court that the reduction in revenue caused by the rates in question, as applied to the entire business for the year 1923, would amount to about $1,700,000, and the question is whether the loss when ascertained with respect to the intrastate business would cause confiscation under the applicable standard as above set forth in the Bluefield Case, supra. In order to determine this question, the court should find the rate of return which was realized from the intrastate business and the rate of return which it is fair to conclude would have been realized from that business under the prescribed rates.\n The conclusion reached by the court as to confiscation had particular reference to the evidence bearing upon the business of the year 1923. The court said that this finding applied 'with increasing force to the succeeding \n\n[282 U.S. 133, 162]\n\u00a0\n years.' But no findings were made as to the value of the property and the revenues and expenses in these years. A rate order which is confiscatory when made may cease to be confiscatory, or one which is valid when made may become confiscatory at a later period. Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, \n238 \nU.S. 153, 172\n, 173 S., 35 S. Ct. 811; Lincoln Gas Co. v. Lincoln, \n250 \nU.S. 256, 268\n, 269 S., 39 S. Ct. 454; Brush Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n262 \nU.S. 443, 446\n, 43 S. Ct. 606; Bluefield Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra. In view of this fact, and as the disposition of the amount withheld by the company under the conditions of the interlocutory injunction will depend on the final decree, there should be appropriate findings as to the results of the intrastate business in Chicago and the effect of the rates in question for each of the years since the date of the Commission's order.\n In order that the necessary findings may be made, and such additional evidence as may be required for that purpose may be received, the decree is set aside, and the cause is remanded to the District Court, specially constituted as provided by the statute, for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion; the restraining order entered in this suit to be continued pending further action of the District Court.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In Board of Commissioners v.

The record shows, however, that the license to use various patented devices, the patents covering which are the property of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, together with engineering, financial and advisory services, are of great actual value to the Chicago Telephone Company such value being evidenced in part by the actual annual saving effected over and above the operating costs should such devices and services not be available. The present payment made by petitioner and under the present license contract to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company averages about $2.10 per station per annum for the City of Chicago and about $1.91 per station per annum for the suburban territory. At $2.10 per station per annum, therefore, the maximum effect upon any one rate for service cannot exceed $0.18 per station per month. Since payment is made to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company by the Chicago Telephone Company of whose stock the former owns approximately 98%, it is necessary that the underlying contract be given scrutiny notwithstanding the fact that the Chicago Telephone Company, as a legal entity, is a free agent. A careful consideration of the evidence in the instant case discloses the unquestioned value of the general services rendered petitioner by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. ... The particular amounts involved have been approved as items of operating expense in different jurisdictions by nine Commissions within the last three years, however, and the Commission after carefully considering all the evidence is of the opinion and finds that the present annual payment under the license contract, limited to $2.10 per station per annum for the City of Chicago and to $1.91 per station per annum for the suburban territory, is not excessive and may be allowed as an item of operating expense.' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The finding of the Commerce Commission, after referring to the ownership of stock by the American Company, was as follows: 'The Commission believes from all the circumstances surrounding the payments made by the Illinois Bell Telephone Company to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the services rendered by the latter tothe former, and the cost thereof, should be at some time fully investigated, to the end that charges for the services may be properly established. The present record does not contain sufficient information to warrant this Commission in departing from the findings of the previous Commission in respect to the payments that should be made by the Illinois Bell Telephone Company to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. The previous Commission found that payment by the Chicago Telephone Company to the parent company of $2.10 per station was sufficient to cover the value of the services rendered. It is certainly more equitable to base the charges for services rendered on the number of stations rather than on the gross revenue because any change in revenues results in a change in payments to the parent company, and would be made without respect to the services rendered.' \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In the Annual Report of the American Company for 1926 it was stated: 'The American Telephone and Telegraph Company was able during the year to make a reduction in its charge to its Associated Companies under its contracts for service, including the furnishing of telephones. The charge was reduced from 4 1\/2 per cent. to 4 per cent. of the gross revenue of those companies, effective from January 1, 1926. The purpose of these contracts is not to make money for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, but to further the development of the telephone art and to enable the growth and expansion of telephone service on a nation-wide basis. While the cost of furnishing the services to any one company, from the nature of the services rendered, cannot be determined, the total cost of furnishing services for all of the companies under the contracts can be approximated. The revenue of $29,850,303 received under the cntr acts during 1926 only slightly more than offset the estimated cost of over $29, 250,000.' \n[\nFootnote 8\n] With respect to these changes the American Company stated in its report for 1927: 'As the business grows and the country grows, conditions change. In the early days of the telephone business it seemed essential that telephone instruments be owned and maintained by a central organization. This condition no longer obtains, and, therefore, as previously stated, the telephone instruments heretofore owned by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company were sold to the operating companies and a reduction was made in the charge for services furnished under service contracts with those companies. In 1926 this charge was reduced from 4 1\/2 per cent. to 4 per cent. of their gross telephone revenues, and this present reduction to 2 per cent. will result in revenues to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company somewhat less than the estimated cost of performing its services under these contracts. This is, however, in accord with our efforts to assist our Associated Companies in keeping down the cost of telephone service in every way possible.' \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The Interstate Commerce Commission has observed: 'In devising methods for accumulating, recording, and utilizing the data essential to the ascertainment of service lives and depreciation rates, the railroad companies may well take note of the experience of the telephone companies. Much of this research and planning work has been done for the Bell System companies by a central organization of a few carefully selected engineers and accountants, and in this way it has been done better and more economically than if each of the numerous operating companies had been left to its own initiative. The independent telephone companies have also profited from this work.'

GEHNER(1930)\nNo. 222\nArgued: February 26, 1930Decided: April 14, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 313, 314]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ralph T. Finley, James C. Jones, and Lon O. Hocker, all of St. Louis, Mo., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 313, 315]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Oliver Senti, of St. Louis, Mo., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 313, 317]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant is an insurance company organized under the laws of Missouri. It maintains that as construed in this case section 6386, Revised Statutes of Missouri 1919, is repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n Section 6386 provides:\n'The property of all insurance companies organized under the laws of this state shall be subject to taxation for state, county, municipal and school purposes, as provided in the general revenue laws of this state in regard to taxation and assessment of insurance companies. \n\n[281 U.S. 313, 318]\n\u00a0\n Every such company or association shall make returns, subject to the provisions of said laws: First, of all the real estate held or controlled by it; second, of the net value of all its other assets or values in excess of the legally required reserve necessary to reinsure its outstanding risks and of any unpaid policy claims, which net values shall be assessed and taxed as the property of individuals . ...'\n\n The company made a return in pursuance of that section. The total value of its personal property was $448,265.33, including $94,000 in United States bonds. The legal reserve and unpaid policy claims amounted to $333,486.69. It deducted such bonds, reserve, and claims, leaving.$20, 778.64 as the net value to be taxed. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The board of equalization declined to accept the return, and, after hearing, the parties held that the bonds of the United States are not taxable, that section 6386 contravenes provisions of the state constitution requiring uniform taxation, and that therefore the company was not entitled to deduct the amount of such reserve and claims. \n\n[281 U.S. 313, 319]\n\u00a0\n The board assessed the company's taxable property at $50,000 without disclosing how it arrived at the amount.\n On the company's application, the state Supreme Court issued its writ of certiorari to bring up for review the record and action of the board. The court held the section valid, found the company's liabilities were chargeable against all its assets-taxable and nontaxable alike-declared that such reserve and claims should be apportioned between the two classes of assets according to their respective amounts, and determined that approximately 79.03 per cent. of such liabilities should be deducted from the value of the taxable personal property, leaving $90,710.80 as the net value to be taxed. \n2\n And as that exceeded the amount fixed by the board, the court refused to disturb the assessment, and entered judgment quashing the writ.\n The company made a motion for rehearing on the ground, among others, that section 6386 as construed violated the clause of section 8, art. 1, of the Constitution, which gives to Congress the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States, and also section 3701, Revised Statutes ( 31 U. S. C.  742 (31 USCA  742)), which provides that all bonds of the United States shall be exempt from taxation by or under state, municipal, or local authority. The court overruled the motion and modified its opinion. The modified opinion was the same as the earlier one except as to details of calculation. It found $74,136.52 to be the tax able \n\n[281 U.S. 313, 320]\n\u00a0\n net value. \n3\n The court did not refer to the federal questions raised by the motion for rehearing.\n\n 1. \nIt is well settled that this court will not consider questions that were not properly presented for decision in the highest court of the state. Ordinarily, it wll not consider contentions first made in a petition to the state court for rehearing where the petition is denied without more. Citizens' National Bank v. Durr, \n257 \nU.S. 99, 106\n, 42 S. Ct. 15. But here the company, at the first opportunity, invoked the protection of the Federal Constitution and statute. It could not earlier have assailed the section as violative of the Constitution and laws of the United States. The board of equalization completely eliminated the bonds from its calculations, and there is nothing in the language of the section to suggest that it authorizes any diminution of the amount of the deductible reserve and unpaid claims or an apportionment of such liabilities between taxable and nontaxable assets. It may not reasonably be held that the company was bound to anticipate such a construction or in advance to invoke federal protection against the taxation of its United States bonds. Upon the facts disclosed by this record it is clear that appellant sufficiently raised in the highest court of the state the federal questions here presented, and is entitled to have them considered. Saunders v. Shaw, \n244 \nU.S. 317, 320\n, 37 S. Ct. 638; Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron Park District, \n281 \nU.S. 74\n, 50 S. Ct. 228, 74 L. Ed. -.\n\n 2. \nIt is elementary that the bonds or other securities of the United States may not be taxed by state authority. \n\n[281 U.S. 313, 321]\n\u00a0\n That immunity always has been deemed an attribute of national supremacy and essential to its maintenance. The power of Congress to borrow money on the credit of the United States would be burdened and might be destroyed by state taxation of the means employed for that purpose. As the tax- exempt feature tends to increase and is reflected in the market prices of such securities, a state tax burden thereon would adversely affect the terms upon which money may be borrowed to execute the purposes of the general government. It necessarily follows from the immunity created by federal authority that a state may not subject one to a greater burden upon his taxable property merely because he owns tax-exempt government securities. Neither ingenuity in calculation nor form of words in state enactments can deprive the owner of the tax exemption established for the benefit of the United States. National Life Ins. Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 508, 519\n, 48 S. Ct. 591, and cases cited; McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431, 432, 436.\n After deducting government bonds (exempt), real estate (otherwise taxed), legal reserve and unpaid policy claims from total assets, there remained the amount returned by appellant,.$20,778.64. The court held the section to require the reserve and unpaid claims to be reduced by the proportion that the value of the United States bonds bears to total assets. It found $74,136.52 to be appellant's taxable net value. And so it used the value of the bonds, $94,000, to increase the taxable amount by $53,357. 88.\n The section discloses a purpose as a general rule to omit from taxation sufficient assets of the insurance companies to cover their legal reserve and unpaid policy claims. It would be competent for the state to permit a less reduction or none at all. But where, as in this case, the ownership of United States bonds is made the basis of denying the full exemption which is accorded to those \n\n[281 U.S. 313, 322]\n\u00a0\n who own no such bonds, this amounts to an infringement of the guaranteed freedom from taxation. It is clear that the value of appellant's government bonds was not disregarded in making up the estimate of taxable net values. That is in violation of the established rule. National Life Ins. Co. v. United States, supra; Northwestern Ins. Co. v. Wisconsin, \n275 \nU.S. 136\n, 48 S. Ct. 55; Miller v. Milwaukee, \n272 \nU.S. 713\n, 47 S. Ct. 280.\n Judgment reversed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE concurs on the ground that this case is governed by National Life Ins. Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 508\n, 48 S. Ct. 591.\n\n Opinion of Mr. Justice STONE, dissenting.\n To state the problem now presented in its simplest concrete form, if an insurance company has policy liabilities of $100,000, $100,000 of taxable personal property, and $100,000 of government bonds, its net assets would be $100,000. Under the statute of Missouri taxing net assets, as applied by the state court, one-half of this net worth or $50,000 would be subject to the tax, since one-half of its entire property consists of taxable assets and so contributes one-half of the net. Under the decision of this Court, the company would go tax free, on the theory that the Constitution requires that, in ascertaining the taxable net worth, tax- exempt bonds must be excluded from the computation as though they were not liable for the debts of the taxpayer.\n That conclusion appears to me to open a new and hitherto unsuspected field of operation for the immunity from taxation enjoyed by national and state securities as instrumentalities of government, and to accord to their owners a privilege which is not justified by anything that has been decided or said by this Court. \n\n[281 U.S. 313, 323]\n\u00a0\n Since Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, this Court, by a long line of decisions, has so restricted the immunity as to relieve only from the burden of taxation imposed on such securities or their income. The immunity has not been supposed to confer other special benefits on their owners. In every case it has been consistently applied so as to leave reasonable scope for the exercise by both national and state governments of the constitutional power to tax. Union P. R. Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5; Plummer v. Coler, \n178 \nU.S. 115\n, 20 S. Ct. 829; South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437, 461\n, 26 S. Ct. 110, 4 Ann. Cas. 737; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 U.S. 107\n, 162-165, 31 S. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; Greiner v. Lewellyn, \n258 \nU.S. 384\n, 42 S. Ct. 324; Blodgett v. Silberman, \n277 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 48 S. Ct. 410; see Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514, 523\n, 524 S., 46 S. Ct. 172.\n The present tax differs from those which have previously been considered by the Court in this connection, in that it is not imposed on any specific identifiable property or its income. It is a tax on net worth, the value of the taxpayer's property after providing for the policy liabilities. Net worth is the result of a mathematical computation, into which of necessity enter all his assets subject to liabilities and all such obligations of the taxpayer as the statute permits to be deducted. It is the result of the computation which is the subject of the tax, and it is the subject of the tax to which exemptions are to be applied.\n The immunity of government bonds from taxation does not carry with it immunity from liability for debts. Scottish Insurance Co. v. Bowland, \n196 \nU.S. 611, 632\n, 25 S. Ct. 345. Hence, whether the measure of the tax be technically described as taxable net worth or as taxable assets less an allowed deduction representing liabilities to which they are subject, the state, in fixing the tax, does not infringe any constitutional immunity by requiring liabilities to be deducted from all the assets, including tax-exempt bonds, \n\n[281 U.S. 313, 324]\n\u00a0\n or, what comes to the same thing, by deducting from taxable assets their proportionate share of the burden of policy liabilities.\n To say that debts must be deducted from taxable assets alone, that no part of the net worth of the taxpayer who owns tax-free securities may be taxed if his debts equal his tax-free assets, is equivalent to saying, in such a situation, either that the taxable assets constitute no part of the net worth or that, even though they are a part, still that part is not taxable. But it is not to be supposed that a mathematician, an accountant, or a business man would regard the taxable assets as contributing nothing to surplus, or, where one-half of the taxpayer's property is tax free, that there is any basis for saying that net worth could, on any theory, be attributed more to one class of assets than the other. Yet the result now reached would seem to presuppose that the tax-exempt securities alone had contributed to the taxpayer's net worth. These incongruous consequences of the rule applied seem to be attributable to the only assumption on which the rule itself could proceed, that government bonds, because they are tax exempt, are also debt exempt, or may not be used for the payment of debts, when in fact and in law tax-exempt securities constitute a part of the corporate reservoir of capital, all of which without distinction may be drawn on for the payment of obligations.\n If Missouri, as it undoubtedly might, had levied a tax on all the property of appellant except its tax-exempt bonds, without any deduction for its policy reserve, it is difficult to see upon what articulate principle the tax would be rendered invalid by permitting the taxpayer to deduct from the value of its assets the same proportion of all its reserves which the taxable assets bear to the total property, all of which is liable for its policies. It would certainly not be because the ownership of the bonds was discriminated against in the apportionment of \n\n[281 U.S. 313, 325]\n\u00a0\n the deduction, or burdened by the tax. Or if, one-half of the gross assets of a taxpayer being chattels without the state, it had taxed his property within the state allowing as a deduction one-half his indebtendness, I do not suppose it would have occurred to any one to say that the levy was invalid as a tax upon the property beyond the taxing jurisdiction. Yet neither of these taxes differs from the present in its effect on the ownership of either taxable or tax-free property.\n The apportionment of net worth according to the amounts of the constituent elements which enter into its computation has long been a familiar method of accountants, and has repeatedly been incorporated in taxing statutes where, for one reason or other, it is desirable or necessary not to impose a tax on some of these elements. The fairness and accuracy of that method has not hiterto been questioned.\n In National Leather Co. v. Massachusetts, \n277 \nU.S. 413\n, 48 S. Ct. 534, the state levied a tax upon 'such proportion of the fair cash value of all the shares constituting the capital stock ... as the value of the assets ... employed ... within the Commonwealth ... bears to the ... total assets of the corporation.' The fair cash value of all the shares was, like net worth, the result of subtracting all the obligations of the company from its gross assets. See First National Bank of Wellington v. Chapman, \n173 \nU.S. 205, 215\n, 19 S. Ct. 407; cf. State Railroad Tax Cases, \n92 U.S. 575\n. The proportion of the net worth which was taxable because attributable to Massachusetts was computed after the deduction was made. If the theory of tax immunity here sustained had been followed, all the debts of the company would have been deducted from that part of the gross assets attributable to the state, since a taxpayer whose gross assets were all taxable would have had that privilege. While the methods of computing the taxable portion of net worth vary, the principle that \n\n[281 U.S. 313, 326]\n\u00a0\n 'deductions for obligations' are to be apportioned among taxables and nontaxables is supported in Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113\n, 41 S. Ct. 45; Bass, Ratcliff, etc., Led., v. Tax Commission, \n266 \nU.S. 271\n, 45 S. Ct. 82; Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 56\n, 57 S., 40 S. Ct. 221; and United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321, 324\n, 325 S., 38 S. Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748.1\n It is said that the present tax must be held invalid because, as a matter of law, exemptions may not be reduced, nor may tax burdens be increased in consequence of the ownership of tax-free securities, and that in the present case their ownership was in fact used to \n\n[281 U.S. 313, 327]\n\u00a0\n increase taxable values. Neither proposition can, I think, be supported. First, it is not universally true that ownership of tax-exempt securities may not increase the burden of a tax. Taxes upon transfer at death, state or federal, may be increased by the ownership by deceased of tax-exempt securities. Plummer v. Coler, supra; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41\n, 20 S. Ct. 747; Greiner v. Lewellyn, supra; Blodgett v. Silberman, supra. Notwithstanding Macallen v. Massachusetts, \n279 \nU.S. 620\n, 49 S. Ct. 432, I do not understand that tax-exempt securities of a corporation, or the income from them, may under no circumstances enter into the computation of a corporate franchise tax and increase it proportionately, or that a broker or dealer in securities may not be taxed on his profits from the purchase and sale of government and state securities. Compare Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165\n, 38 S. Ct. 432; Barclay & Co. v. Edwards, \n267 \nU.S. 442\n, 45 S. Ct. 135, 348. In National Leather Co. v. Massachusetts, supra, an increase of property outside the taxing state might increase the tax on net assets within the state. For like reasons it would seem that the tax-free securities might rightly enter into the computation of net worth since they are liable for debts and so contribute to net worth, and that the net worth thus computed should be held subject to the state tax, except in so far as tax-exempt securities contribute to it.\n Second, in the present case it is difficult to see in what respect the mere ownership of the appellant's tax-free securities has been resorted to in order to increase taxable net values. That conclusion does not follow from the fact that the state court in its second opinion found a larger taxable value upon a different interpretation of the statute than in its first. It could be true only if, by the consistent application of the rule finally laid down, the shifting of some of the taxpayer's investments from taxable to exempt securities would result in an increase of \n\n[281 U.S. 313, 328]\n\u00a0\n the tax. But such is not the effect of the statute, for, if the taxpayer who owns no exempt property may be taxed on his full net worth, but is taxed only half as much if he converts one-half of his gross assets into tax-exempt bonds, it would seem that ownership of the latter had resulted in a decrease and not an increase of taxable values, and that the burden of the tax is diminished with mathematical exactness in the proportion that the taxpayer has chosen to invest in tax-exempt securities.\n Invoking the rule now laid down, a taxpayer having no tax-exempt securities and legitimately bearing the burden of a state tax on net worth may put off the burden completely by the simple expedient of purchasing, on credit, government bonds equal in value to his net taxable assets. The success of a device so transparently destructive of the taxing power of the state may well raise doubts of the correctness of the constitutional principle supposed to sustain it. So construed, the Constitution does more than protect the ownership of government bonds from the burdens of taxation. It confers upon that ownership an affirmative benefit at the expense of the taxing power of the state by relieving the owner from the full burden of taxation on net worth to which his taxable assets have in some measure contributed.\n But it is no less our duty to recognize and protect the powers reserved to the state under the Constitution than the immunities granted to the federal government. South Carolina v. United States, supra. The right of the state to tax net worth, so far as it is attributable to taxable assets, and that of the national government to insist upon its exemption so far as tax-free property enters into its computation, stand on an equal footing. There is nothing in the Constitution nor in the decisions of this Court to justify a taxpayer in demanding that the one should be sacrificed to the other, or which would \n\n[281 U.S. 313, 329]\n\u00a0\n support the national government in saying to the state that in ascertaining taxable net worth debts must be deducted from taxable assets alone, any more than it would support the state in insisting that debts should be deducted exclusively from the taxpayer's government bonds in ascertaining taxable net worth.\n Nothing said by this Court in National Life Insurance Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 508\n, 48 S. Ct. 591, decided one week later than the National Leather Company Case, supra, should lead to a reversal of the judgment below. In that case an act of Congress taxing the income of insurance companies granted an exemption of 4 per cent. of their reserve. By the terms of the statute the benefit of the exemption was withheld to the extent that the taxpayer received income from tax-exempt securities. The statute regulated only the exercise of the power of the national government to tax. Neither it nor the decision of the court affected the taxing power of a state. The statute was assailed solely on the ground that it discriminated against the holder of tax-exempt securities merely because they were tax exempt, to the extent that the statutory exemption was withheld from the holder of government, state, and municipal bonds. The effect of this discrimination was that, if the taxpayer shifted investments from its taxable to its tax-exempt list, its tax remained undiminished until the income from the tax-free list equalled the statutory exemption.\n After pointing out that the collector in applying the statute had diminished the statutory exemption by the amount of interest received from tax exempt securities, the court said, page 519 of 277 U. S., 48 S. Ct. 591, 593: 'This, he (the tax collector) required petitioner to pay more upon its taxable income than could have been demanded had this been derived solely from taxable securities. If permitted, this would destroy the guaranteed exemption. One may not be \n\n[281 U.S. 313, 330]\n\u00a0\n subjected to greater burdens upon his taxable property solely because he owns some that is free.'\n But the present statute has no such effect. Calling the deduction of policy liabilities, required for the computation of the tax, an 'exemption,' and saying that ownership of tax exempt securities is made the basis of denying the 'full exemption,' may give this case a verbal resemblance to that, but it does no more. True, a change by appellant from taxable to tax- free investments would result in a smaller deduction from its taxable assets, but it would also result in a proportionate reduction of its taxable assets with a corresponding decrease in taxable values, always, in exact proportion to appellant's investment in tax-exempt securities.\n Only if the taxpayer were the fortunate recipient of a gift of tax- exempt securities could the net worth of its taxable securities be increased, and this not solely or at all because its newly acquired securities are 'free,' but because they, like its taxable assets, may be used to meet policy obligations, and thus proportionately relieve taxable assets from that burden. Similarly, a gift by way of payment of policy obligations or reinsurance would increase the tax, although it would not increase taxable assets. So the increase, by gift, of property outside the state, would increase the tax upon net assets within the state. The property outside the state is not subject to a tax, but it must pay its share of the debts. But in every case, as in the present, the tax assessed would correspond with mathematical exactness to the contributions made by the taxable assets to the total not worth. Hence the question here is not whether the taxpayer has been discriminated against because he owns government bonds, but only whether the privilege which the state recognizes as attaching to their ownership is sufficiently great.\n If the constitutional inhibition is not directed against the imposition of burdens, but affirmatively compels the \n\n[281 U.S. 313, 331]\n\u00a0\n annexation of such benefits to the ownership of government bonds as will increase their currency and stimulate the market for them, even though those privileges are extended at the expense of the constitutional powers of the states, it is difficult to see what the limits of such a doctrine may be. I suppose that the sale and market value of government bonds would be materially increased if we were to say that the Constitution sub silentio had forbidden their seizure for debts, or rendered their possessor immune from the various forms of state taxation to which this Court has said he is subject. But however desirable such a consequence might be thought to be, that could hardly be taken as a sufficient ground for saying it.\n I think the judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The substance of the return follows:\n Real Estate, Improvement, etc. $142,000 00 Bonds, Municipals 289,000 00 Bonds, Government 94,000 00 Bonds, Mortgages 60,000 00 Cash 5,265 33 Total Assets $590,265 33 Less Real Estate assessed as above and on which the Company pays taxes $142,000 00 Less reserve required by law 326,522 69 Less U.

The result was .7903. Total liabilities $333,480.69 ($326,522.69 reserve and $6,964.00, unpaid policy claims) was multiplied by .7903. The result was $263,554.53. This was subtracted from $354,265.33, and the difference was $90,710.80. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The court divided total taxable assets $496,265.33 ($349,000 bonds, $ 5,265.33 cash, and $142,000 real estate) by total assets $590,265.33 ($349, 000 bonds, $5,265.33 cash, $94,000 United States bonds and $142,000 real estate). The result was .84. Total liabilities $333,486.69 was multiplied by .84. The result was $280,128.81. This was subtracted from $354,265.33, taxable personal assets, and the difference was $74,136.52. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The difference between the two methods may be illustrated by supposing a corporation with gross assets of $15,000,000 and obligations of $5,000,000. The fair cash value of all the shares would then be $10,000, 000. Assume that one-tenth of its property is in Massachusetts. The assessment would be $1,000,000 under the Leather Company Case. By the present method $5,000,000 would be deducted from one-tenth of the gross assets, $1,500,000, because a concern owning no exempt property might make that deduction. Under the present case the company would be free from tax.\n In Shaffer v. Carter, Oklahoma levied a net income tax; in the case of residents, upon income derived from all sources; in the case of nonresidents, upon locally derived income. Residents were permitted to deduct all losses; nonresidents were permitted deductions only for local losses. The Court said (page 57 of 252 U. S., 40 S. Ct. 221, 227):\n'The difference, however, is only such as arises naturally from the extent of the jurisdiction of the state in the two classes of cases, and cannot be regarded as an unfriendly or unreasonable discrimination. As to residents it may, and does, exert its taxing power over their income from all sources, whether within or without the state, and it accords to them a corresponding privilege of deducting their losses, wherever these accrue. As to nonresidents, the jurisdiction extends only to their property owned within the state and their business, trade, or profession carried on therein, and the tax is only on such income as is derived from those sources. Hence there is no obligation to accord to them a deduction by reason of losses elsewhere incurred.'\n\n There seems to be as colorable reason in that case as in this for asserting that the receipt of exempt income is made the basis for a reduction or elimination of an exemption granted to others. \n\n\n\n\n","112":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF OHIO EX REL BRYANT v. AKRON METROPOLITAN PARK DIST FOR(1930)\nNo. 237\nArgued: Decided: March 12, 1930\n\n\n Met. Park Dist for Sum. Co. \n281 U.S. 74\n (1930) ]\n\n\n[281 U.S. 74, 76]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederick A. Henry and Luther Day, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for appellants.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two cases were argued together and present substantially the same questions. Each suit was brought in the state court by a taxpayer attacking the validity of the Park District Act of the State (General Code of Ohio,  2976-1 to 2976-10i; 107 Ohio Laws, pp. 65-69, 108 Ohio Laws pt. 2, pp. 1097-1100). The one suit related to the park district board of the Akron district, and the other to that of the Cleveland district, and in each suit the taxpayer sought an injunction against the park boards, respectively, together with the auditor of the county where the board revenues and disbursements are handled. from expending public moneys, or incurring obligations requiring such expenditure, and from taking any other official action on behalf of the district. The statute was assailed as being in violation of the Constitution of the state and also of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The \n\n[281 U.S. 74, 77]\n\u00a0\n validity of the act was sustained by the court of common pleas, and by the Court of Appeals, of the counties where the suits were brought. On error proceedings from these judgments, the cases were heard together in the Supreme Court of the state, and that court was divided in opinion, two of the justices holding the statute to be valid, and five of them being of the contrary view. Section 2 of Article 4 of the Constitution of Ohio provides that 'no law shall be held unconstitutional and void by the Supreme Court without the concurrence of at least all but one of the judges, except in the affirmance of a judgment of the court of appeals declaring a law unconstitutional and void.' Accordingly, in these suits, the judgments in favor of the defendants were affirmed by the Supreme Court, and, thereupon, motions were made in that court to vacate the judgments and to enter judgments of reversal. It was then alleged that the above-mentioned provision of the Constitution of the state was in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, in that it denied to citizens of Ohio due process of law and the equal protection of the laws, and also that the provision was repugnant to section 4 of article 4 of the Federal Constitution assuring to every state a republican form of government. The Supreme Court of the state overruled the motions, and from the judgments of affirmance, and the orders denying the motions to vacate, appeals have been taken to this Court.\n The grounds for attack, under the Fourteenth Amendment, on the validity of the Park District Act, relate to the organization and powers of the park district boards. The act provides for the presentation to the probate judge of the county of a petition for the establishment of the proposed district, and, after notice and hearing, the probate judge, with or without diminishing or altering, but without enlarging, the suggested boundaries, is to enter an order creating the district, provided he finds the \n\n[281 U.S. 74, 78]\n\u00a0\n proceedings to be regular and that the creation of the district will be conductive to the general welfare. The probate judge is then to appoint three commissioners who are to constitute the board of park commissioners of the district, being a body politic and corporate. The board thus constituted is to have power to acquire lands within the district for the conservation of its natural resources, and, to that end, may create parkways, parks and other reservations of land, and develop, improve and protect the same in such manner as they may deem conducive to the general welfare. The board is authorized to lay assessments upon specially benefited lands in an amount not exceeding, and in proportion to, the special benefits conferred by the development or improvement. The board is also authorized to levy taxes upon all taxable property within the district in an amount not in excess of one-tenth of one mill upon each dollar of the assessed value of the property in the district in any one year, subject, however, to the combined maximum levy for all purposes otherwise provided by law. On further petitions, and on the determination by the park board of the advisability of the annexation of additional territory, whether located within or without the county in which the district is created, the probate court of the county within which the additional territory is located, in proceedings similar to those originally instituted, may provide for such annexation. The board is also authorized to adopt by-laws, rules and regulations for the preservation of good order within and adjacent to the parks and reservations of land under their jurisdiction and of property and natural life therein. The violation of such by-laws, rules or regulations constitutes a misdemeanor. The board may submit to the electors of the district the question of levying additional taxes for the use of the district, declaring the necessity of such levy, the purpose for which the taxes are to be used, the annual rate proposed and \n\n[281 U.S. 74, 79]\n\u00a0\n the number of consecutive years that such rate shall be levied. If a majority of the electors voting upon the question favor the levy, such taxes shall be levied accordingly, provided the rate submitted to the electors at any one time shall not exceed one-tenth of one mill annually upon each dollar of valuation. The board is empowered to issue bonds, in anticipation of the collection of such levy, for the purpose of acquiring and improving lands.\n It was insisted by the taxpayers, plaintiffs in the state court, that these statutory provisions involved an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the probate court and to the nonelective park commissioners. We do not consider it necessary to consider at length this objection, or the other points sought to be made against the statute under the Fourteenth Amendment, as, in view of the repeated decisions of this Court, we do not find any substantial federal question presented. Houck v. Little River Drainage District, \n239 \nU.S. 254, 262\n, 36 S. Ct. 58; Orr v. Allen (D. C.) 245 F. 486; Id., \n248 \nU.S. 35\n, 39 S. Ct. 23; Soliah v. Heskin, \n222 \nU.S. 522\n, 32 S. Ct. 103.\n The question with respect to the validity, from a federal standpoint, of the provision of the state Constitution that no law shall be held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the state without a concurrence of at least all but one of the judges, except in the affirmance of a judgment of the Court of Appeals declaring a law unconstitutional, was not raised in these suits until after the judgments of affirmance by the Supreme Court. But it is insisted that the point could not have been taken earlier, as in advance of the affirmance on a vote of the minority the question would have been speculative. Hence, it is said that the federal question was raised at the earliest opportunity. Saunders v. Shaw, \n244 \nU.S. 317, 320\n, 37 S. Ct. 638. Assuming that the federal question is thus brought here, we find it to be without merit.\n As to the guaranty to every state of a republican form of government ( section 4, art. 4), it is well settled that the \n\n[281 U.S. 74, 80]\n\u00a0\n questions arising under it are political, not judicial, in character, and thus are for the consideration of the Congress and not the courts. Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, \n223 \nU.S. 118\n, 32 S. Ct. 224; O'Neill v. Leamer, \n239 \nU.S. 244, 248\n, 36 S. Ct. 54; State of Ohio ex rel. Davis v.

Cas. 1917D, 642.\n As to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is sufficient to say that, as frequently determined by this court, the right of appeal is not essential to due process, provided that due process has already been accorded in the tribunal of first instance. McKane v. Durston, \n153 \nU.S. 684, 687\n, 14 S. Ct. 913; Pittsburgh, etc., Railway Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 421, 427\n, 14 S. Ct. 1114; Reetz v. Michigan, \n188 \nU.S. 505, 508\n, 23 S. Ct. 390; Rogers v. Peck, \n199 \nU.S. 425, 435\n, 26 S. Ct. 87; Standard Oil Co. of Indiana v. State of Missouri, \n224 \nU.S. 270, 286\n, 32 S. Ct. 406, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 936. The opportunity afforded to litigants in Ohio to contest all constitutional and other questions fully in the common pleas court and again in the Court of Appeals plainly satisfied the requirement of the Federal Constitution in this respect, and the state was free to establish the limitation in question in relation to appeals to its Supreme Court in accordance with its views of state policy.\n In invoking the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is argued that the result of the application of the provision of the state Constitution may be that the same statute may be held constitutional in a case arising in one county, and unconstitutional in another case arising in another county. This point is obviously not of importance in relation to the question of the validity of the Park District Act under the Federal Constitution, as the act of Congress (28 USCA  344) makes appropriate provision for the hearing and determination by this court of such a question where a federal right has been passed upon by the highest court of the state in which a deci- \n\n[281 U.S. 74, 81]\n\u00a0\n sion could be had. But it is said that, from the standpoint of the state Constitution, the statute may operate unequally. It is unnecessary to comment on this point so far as the mere inconvenience which may be caused by possible conflicts is concerned. It is urged that the situation has been described as deplorable by the Supreme Court of the state (Board of Education v. Columbus, 118 Ohio St. 295, 160 N. E. 902) but it is not for this Court to intervene to protect the citizens of the state from the consequences of its policy, if the state has not disregarded the requirements of the Federal Constitution. In the present instance, there has been as yet no conflict of decision. The provision of the state Constitution which is attacked is one operating uniformly throughout the entire state. The state has a wide discretion in respect to establishing its systems of courts and distributing their jurisdiction. It has been held by this Court that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not violated by diversity in the jurisdiction of the several courts of a state as to subject-matter or finality of decision if all persons within the territorial limits of the respective jurisdictions of the state courts have an equal right in like cases under like circumstances to resort to them for redress. A state 'may establish one system of courts for cities and another for rural districts, one system for one portion of its territory and another system for another portion.' Missouri v. Lewis, \n101 \nU.S. 22, 30\n, 31 S.. Different courts of appeal may be set up for different portions of the state. Id., page 33, of 101 U. S.. It is thus well established that there is no requirement of the Federal Constitution that the state shall adopt a unifying method of appeals which will insure to all litigants within the state the same decisions on particular questions which may arise.

He objected to the jurisdiction of the Court, but the objection was overruled and an order for temporary alimony was made. He thereupon applied to the Supreme Court of the State for a writ of prohibition, but upon demurrer to the petition the writ was denied. 119 Ohio St. 484, 164 N. E. 524. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n279 \nU.S. 828\n, 49 S. Ct. 265.\n The facts alleged are that the relator is Vice-Consul of Roumania and a citizen of that country, stationed and now residing at Cleveland, Ohio, and it is said by the Supreme Court to have been conceded at the argument that he was married to Helen Popovici, the plaintiff in the original suit, in Stark county, Ohio, where she resided. The relator invokes article 3, section 2, of the Constitution: 'The judicial Power shall extend ... to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls.' 'In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls ... the supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction'; and also the Judicial Code (Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231)  256 (28 USCA  371). 'The jurisdiction vested in the courts of the United States in the cases and proceedings hereinafter mentioned, shall be exclusive of the courts of the several States: ... \n\n[280 U.S. 379, 383]\n\u00a0\n Eighth. Of all suits and proceedings against ambassadors, or other public ministers, or their domestics, or domestic servants, or against consuls or vice consuls.' To this may be added section 24 (28 USCA  41(18) giving to the District Court original jurisdiction: 'Eighteenth. Of all suits against consuls and vice consuls'; the Supreme Court by section 233 (28 USCA  341) being given 'exclusively all such jurisdiction of suits or proceedings against ambassadors or other public ministers, or their domestics or domestic servants, as a court of law can have consistently with the law of nations.'\n The language so far as it affects the present case is pretty sweeping, but like all language it has to be interpreted in the light of the tacit assumptions upon which it is reasonable to suppose that the language was used. It has been understood that, 'the whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the states and not to the laws of the United States,' Ex parte Burrus, \n136 \nU.S. 586, 583\n, 594 S., 10 S. Ct. 850, 853, and the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States over divorces and alimony always has been denied. Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582. Simms v. Simms, \n175 \nU.S. 162, 167\n, 20 S. Ct. 58; De La Rama v. De La Rama, \n201 \nU.S. 303, 307\n, 26 S. Ct. 485. A suit for divorce between the present parties brought in the District Court of the United States was dismissed. Popovici v. Popovici (D. C.) 30 F.(2d) 185.\n The words quoted from the Constitution do not of themselves and without more exclude the jurisdiction of the State. Plaquemines Tropical Fruit Co. v. Henderson, \n170 \nU.S. 511\n, 18 S. Ct. 685. The statutes do not purport to exclude the State Courts from jurisdiction except where they grant it to Courts of the United States. Therefore they do not affect the present case if it be true as has been unquestioned for three-quarters of a century that the Courts of the United States have no jurisdiction over divorce. If when the Constitution was adopted the common understanding \n\n[280 U.S. 379, 384]\n\u00a0\n was that the domestic relations of husband and wife and parent and child were matters reserved to the States, there is no difficulty in construing the instrument accordingly and not much in dealing with the statutes. 'Suits against consuls and vice-consuls' must be taken to refer to ordinary civil proceedings and not to include what formerly would have belonged to the ecclesiastical Courts.\n It is true that there may be objections of policy to one of our States intermeddling with the domestic relations of an official and subject of a foreign power that conceivably might regard jurisdiction as determined by nationality and not by domicil. But on the other hand if, as seems likely, the wife was an American citizen, probably she remained one notwithstanding her marriage. Act Sept. 22, 1922, c. 411,  3, 42 Stat. 1021, 1022 (8 USCA  9). Her position certainly is not less to be considered than her husband's, and at all events these considerations are not for us.\n In the absence of any prohibition in the Constitution or laws of the United States it is for the State to decide how far it will go.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","114":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF OKLAHOMA v.

The facts were set forth in detail and the law governing the parties was established by the decision reported in \n278 \nU.S. 367\n, 49 S. Ct. 163. It was decided that the defendant State and its creature the Sanitary District were reducing the level of the Great Lakes, were inflicting great losses upon the complainants and were violating their rights, by diverting from Lake Michigan 8,500 or more cubic feet per second into the Chicago Drainage Canal for the purpose of diluting and carrying away the sewage of Chicago. The diversion of the water for that purpose was held illegal, but the restoration of the just rights of the complainants was made gradual rather than immediate in order to avoid so far as might be the possible pestilence and ruin with which the defendants have done much to confront themselves. The case was referred a second time to the master to consider what measures would be necessary and what time required to effect the object to be attained. The master now has reported. Both sides have taken exceptions, but, as we shall endeavor to show, the issues open here are of no great scope. \n\n[281 U.S. 179, 197]\n\u00a0\n The defendants have submitted their plans for the disposal of the sewage of Chicago in such a way as to diminish so far as possible the diversion of water from the Lake. In the main these plans are approved by the complainants. The master has given them a most thorough and conscientious examination. But they are material only as bearing on the amount of diminution to be required from time to time and the times to be fixed for each step, and therefore we shall not repeat the examination. It already has been decided that the defendants are doing a wrong to the complainants and that they must stop it. They must find out a way at their peril. We have only to consider what is possible if the State of Illinois devotes all its powers to dealing with an exigency to the magnitude of which it seems not yet to have fully awaked. It can base no defences upon difficulties that it has itself created. If its Constitution stands in the way of prompt action it must amend it or yield to an authority that is paramount to the State.\n The defendants' exceptions deal with the extent to which the diversion of water should be reduced and to the time at which the reductions should take place. They argue that a recent rise in the level of Lake Michigan should be taken into account. This cannot be done. Apart from the speculation involved as to the duration of the rise, there is a wrong to be righted, and the delays allowed are allowed only for the purpose of limiting, within fair possibility, the requirements of immediate justice pressed by the complaining States. These requirements as between the parties are the constitutional right of those States, subject to whatever modification they hereafter may be subjected to by Congress acting within its authority. It will be time enough to consider the scope of that authority when it is exercised. In present conditions there is no invasion of it by the former decision of this Court, as urged by the defendants. The \n\n[281 U.S. 179, 198]\n\u00a0\n right of the complainants to a decree is not affected by the possibility that Congress may take some action in the matter. See Southern Utilities Co. v. Palatka, \n268 \nU.S. 232, 233\n, 45 S. Ct. 488; Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 117\n, 27 S. Ct. 655.\n The master finds that, on and after July 1, 1930, the diversion of water from Lake Michigan should not be allowed to exceed an annual average of 6,500 cubic feet per second in addition to what is drawn for domestic uses. He finds that when the contemplated controlling works are constructed that are necessary for the purpose of preventing reversals of the Chicago River at times of storm and the introduction of storm flow into Lake Michigan, works that will require the approval of the Secretary of War and that the master finds should be completed and put in operation within two years after the approval is given, and probably by December 31, 1935, the diversion should be limited to an annual average of 5,000 c. f. s. 'in addition to domestic pumpage.' On this point we deal only with the amount and the time. When the whole system for sewage treatment is complete and the controlling works installed he finds that the diversion should be cut down to an annual average of 1,500 c. f. s. in addition to domestic pumpage. This, he finds, should be accomplished on or before December 31, 1938; and the full operation of one of the contemplated works, the West Side Sewage Treatment Plant, which would permit a partial reduction of the diversion is to be not later than December 31, 1935. These recommendations are subject to the appointment of a commission to supervise the work, or, better in our opinion, to the filing with the clerk of this Court, at stated periods, by the Sanitary District, of reports as to the progress of the work, at the coming in of which either party may make application to the Court for such action as may seem to be suitable. All action of the parties and the Court in this case will be subject, of course, to any order that Congress may \n\n[281 U.S. 179, 199]\n\u00a0\n make in pursuance of its constitutional powers and any modification that necessity may show should be made by this Court. These recommendations we approve within the limits stated above, and they will be embodied in the decree. The defendants argue for delay at every point but we have indicated sufficiently why their arguments cannot prevail. The master was as liberal in the allowance of time as the evidence permitted him to be.\n The exceptions of the complainants go mainly to a point not yet mentioned. The sewage of Chicago at present is discharged into a canal that extends to Lockport on the Des Plaines River (which flows into the Illinois, which in its turn flows into the Mississippi), from Wilmette on the north and a point on the Lake near the boundary line of Indiana on the south, with another intake midway between these two at the mouth of the Chicago River, which has been reversed from its former flow into Lake Michigan to a flow from the Lake. The change is narrated at length in the former decision of this case. \n278 U.S. 367\n, 401, et seq., 49 S. Ct. 163. See, also, Missouri v. Illinois, \n180 U.S. 208\n, 211 et seq., 21 S. Ct. 331; Id., \n200 \nU.S. 496\n, 26 S. Ct. 268. It is partially to oxidize and carry off this sewage that the main diversion of water is made. The complainants demand that this diversion cease, and the canal be closed at Lockport, with an incidental return of the Chicago River to its original course. They also argue that what is called the domestic pumpage after being purified in the sewage works be returned to the Lake. These demands seem to us excessive upon the facts in this case. The master reports that the best way of preventing the pollution of navigable waters is to permit an outflow from the Drainage Canal at Lockport, and that the interests of navigation in the Chicago River as a part of the port of Chicago will require the diversion of an annual average of from 1,000 c. f. s. to 1,500 c. f. s. in addition to domestic pumpage after the sewage \n\n[281 U.S. 179, 200]\n\u00a0\n treatment program has been carried out. The canal was opened at the beginning of the century, thirty years ago. In 1900 it already was a subject of litigation in this Court. The amount of water ultimately to be withdrawn unless Congress may prescribe a different measure is relatively small. We think that upon the principles stated in Missouri v. Illinois, \n200 U.S. 496\n, 520, et seq., 26 S. Ct. 268, the claims of the complainants should not be pressed to a logical extreme without regard to relative suffering and the time during which the complainants have let the defendants go on without complaint.\n Perhaps the complainants would not be very insistent with regard to the 1,000 or 1,500 c. f. s. which earlier in this case they seemed to admit to be reasonable, if their demand were allowed that the domestic pumpage be purified and returned to the Lake-a demand not contemplated by their bill. But purification is not absolute. How nearly perfect it will be with the colossal works that the defendants have started is somewhat a matter of speculation. The master estimates that with efficient operation the proposed treatment should reach an average of 85 per cent. purification and probably will be 90 per cent. or more. Even so we are somewhat surprised that the complainants should desire the effluent returned. The withdrawal of water for domestic purposes is not assailed by the complainants and we are of opinion that the course recommended by the master is more reasonable than the opposite demand. If the amount withdrawn should be excessive, it will be open to complaint. Whether the right for domestic use extends to great industrial plants within the District has not been argued but may be open to consideration at some future time.\n We see no reason why costs should not be paid by the defendants, who have made this suit necessary by persisting in unjustifiable acts.

Wood, of New York City, for appellant.\n\n\n[281 U.S. 98, 103]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case was submitted to the state court upon an agreed statement of facts, and presented the question of the validity of a provision of section 29 of the Workmen's Compensation Law of New York (Consol. Laws, c. 67) under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Joseph Perroth, in the course of his employment by one Anderson, was killed through the negligence of the appellant, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railway Company. Perroth left surviving him a dependent, his widow. The administratrix of Perroth brought an action against the appellant to recover damages caused by his death, and the claim was settled by the payment of an amount in excess of that which the dependent would have been entitled to receive under the Workmen's Compensation Law. In these circumstances, there being no right of recovery by the dependent of Perroth against his employer, subdivi- \n\n[281 U.S. 98, 104]\n\u00a0\n sions 8 and 9 of section 15 of the Workmen's Compensation Law became applicable. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[281 U.S. 98, 105]\n\u00a0\n The scheme of these provisions was the creation of two special funds in the hands of the state treasurer, the one to be used in paying additional compensation to employees incurring permanent total disability after permanent partial disability; and the other, in the vocational education of employees so injured as to need rehabilitation. These special funds were to be maintained by payments by the insurance carrier, as defined in the act,2 of $500 for each of the two funds in those cases of injury causing death where there were no persons entitled to compensation under the act, and the payments made out of these special funds for the benefit of employees of the described classes were to be over and above the compensation which the act required to be made by the respective employers of such employees.\n In the present instance, the respondent, as the insurer of Perroth's employer, paid to the state treasurer the amount of two awards, of $500 each, made jointly against Perroth's employer and the respondent under subdivisions 8 and 9 of section 15. The respondent then brought this suit under section 29 of the Workmen's Compensation Law to recover this amount from the appellant which had wrongfully caused the death. That section provides:\n'In case of the payment of an award to the state treasurer in accordance with subdivisions eight and nine of section fifteen such payment shall operate to give the employer or insurance carrier liable for the award a cause of action for the amount of such payment together with the reasonable funeral expenses and the expense of medi- \n\n[281 U.S. 98, 106]\n\u00a0\n cal treatment which shall be in addition to any cause of action by the legal representatives of the deceased.'\n\n Two questions were submitted to the state court:\n'First. Was the state treasurer entitled to the awards made in his favor and paid by the plaintiff?\n\n'Second. If the first question is answered in the affirmative, is the plaintiff entitled to recover the amount of said awards from the defendant by reason of section twenty-nine of the Workmen's Compensation Law?'\n\n The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the state answered both questions in the affirmative (224 App. Div. 346, 230 N. Y. S. 747), and the judgment entered accordingly for the respondent was affirmed by the Court of Appeals (251 N. Y. 127, 167 N. E. 194). That court decided that the provision of section 29 which was held to justify the recovery did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment as denying either due process of law of the equal protection of the laws.\n The due process clause is invoked on the ground that there is no reasonable basis for the creation of a cause of action against the appellant, and that the statute arbitrarily takes the property of one person for the private use and benefit of another. It is recognized that the state may create new rights and duties and provide for their appropriate enforcement. Recovery for an injury causing death and employers' liability and workmen's compensation acts are familiar illustrations. But it is argued that the appellant committed no wrong against the respondent, and that, for the wrong against the deceased and his widow, the appellant has made full restitution. The fact of this restitution, however, is an inadequate basis for the conclusion sought. It cannot be said that, in providing for the recovery of the loss sustained by the dependents or next of kin of a deceased, the state has exhausted its authority to provide redress for the wrong. \n\n[281 U.S. 98, 107]\n\u00a0\n The state may permit the recovery of punitive damages in an action by the representatives of the deceased in order to strike effectively at the evil to be prevented. Pizitz Dry Goods Co. v. Yeldell, \n274 \nU.S. 112, 116\n, 47 S. Ct. 509, 51 A. L. R. 1376. The state might also, if it saw fit, provide for a recovery by the employer for the loss sustained by him by reason of the wrongful act. The wrong may also be regarded as one against the state itself, in depriving the state of the benefit of the life of one owing it allegiance. For this wrong the state might impose a penalty. This is not contested. And it is well settled that the made in which penalties shall be enforced, and the disposition of the amounts collected are matters of legislative discretion. Missouri Pacific Railway Company v. Humes, \n115 \nU.S. 512, 523\n, 6 S. Ct. 110.\n But it is said that the Legislature cannot cause a liability to accrue to a stranger against whom the wrongdoer committed no breach of duty. If, however, the state might penalize the wrongdoer by requiring a payment to be made by him directly to the state treasury, there would seem to be no reason why the state cannot compel the wrongdoer to indemnify the employer, and his insurance carrier, for payments properly required of them and made to the state where the liability for such payments has arisen by reason of the death caused by the wrongful act. The state in this instance could have imposed a penalty on the wrongdoer and turned the amount over to the employer or his insurer for their indemnity. It could accomplish the same purpose without circumlocution.\n There is no question here as to the validity of the provisions for the creation of the special funds in the hands of the state treasurer, in order to provide additional compensation to employees in cases requiring special consideration, or as to the validity of the requirement of payment by employers and their insurance carriers in order to maintain such funds. The constitutionality of these statutory \n\n[281 U.S. 98, 108]\n\u00a0\n provisions has been sustained by this court. R. E. Sheehan Co. v. Shuler, \n265 \nU.S. 371\n, 44 S. Ct. 548, 35 A. L. R. 1056; New York State Railways v. Shuler, \n265 \nU.S. 379\n, 44 S. Ct. 551. These provisions were an appropriate part of the plan of the Workmen's Compensation Law. It was not considered that the due process clause was violated because the additional compensation, to be made in the described classes of cases, was not paid to the injured employees by their immediate employers or because payment was to be made out of public funds established for the purpose. R. E. Sheehan Co. v. Shuler, supra. Thus, the respondent is in no proper sense a stranger to the wrongful act of the appellant. The respondent under the law of the state insured the employer of the deceased, and, as insurer, was required by the statute to make the payments in question to the state treasury. As these payments became obligatory because of the death caused by appellant's wrongful act, the indemnification of the respondent was a natural and reasonable requirement in consequence of that act. In creating the cause of action in order to obtain this indemnification, there was no lack of due process of law, as there was none in the means afforded by the state for enforcing the liability. In the action to enforce it, the appellant could, as the state court has held in the present case, 'avail itself of any defense which it has or ever had. It has a right to establish, if it can, that there could have been no recovery in the negligence action which it settled, and may test the validity of the awards against the insurance carrier by any defense which the carrier could have interposed, as it was not a party to that proceeding and is not bound thereby.'\n Nor do we find any sufficient ground for the contention that the statutory provisions in question denied the equal protection of the laws. The classification is attacked as arbitrary because it is said to rest on the circumstance \n\n[281 U.S. 98, 109]\n\u00a0\n whether or not there are persons entitled to compensation under the statute in the particular case, and that this depends on the further circumstance whether there are dependents, and, if there are, whether they recover at least as much as the compensation for which the act provides. But this is the classification with respect to the requirement of the payments by the employer or his insurer for the maintenance of the special funds. That cannot be said to be an unreasonable classification, as it provides for those cases where there are no persons entitled to compensation under the act, and thus the immediate employer and his insurer are relieved of the obligation to pay compensation. And, in view of the decisions of this court, above cited, the validity of subdivisions 8 and 9 of section 15 of the statute, as construed by the state court, requiring the payments by the employer and the insured in this instance, have not been questioned. So far as the provision of section 29 is concerned, it operates uniformly against all wrongdoers in like circumstances; that is, whenever awards as required by subdivisions 8 and 9 of section 15 have been made against the employer, or his insurer, and such awards have been paid to the state treasurer.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Subdivisions 8 and 9 of section 15, as they stood at the time of Perroth's death, were as follows:\n's 15. Schedule in Case of Disability. The following schedule of compensation is hereby established:\n\n'8. Permanent total disability after permanent partial disability. If an employee who has previously incurred permanent partial disability through the loss of one hand, one arm, one foot, one leg, or one eye, incurs permanent total disability through the loss of another member or organ, he shall be paid, in addition to the compensation for permanent partial disability provided in this section and after the cessation of the payments for the prescribed period of weeks special additional compensation for the remainder of his life to the amount of sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the average weekly wage earned by him at the time the total permanent disability was incurred. Such additional compensation shall be paid out of a special fund created for such purpose in the following manner: The insurance carrier shall pay to the state treasurer for every case of injury causing death in which there are no persons entitled to compensation the sum of five hundred dollars. The state treasurer shall be the custodian of this special fund, and the commissioner shall direct the distribution thereof.\n\n'9. Expenses for rehabilitating injured employees. An employee, who as a result of injury is or may be expected to be totally or partially incapacitated for a remunerative occupation and who, under the direction of the state department of education is being rendered fit, to engage in a remunerative occupation, shall receive additional compensation necessary for his rehabilitation, not more than ten dollars per week of which shall be expended for maintenance. Such expense and such of the administrative expenses of the state department of education as are properly assignable to the expense of rehabilitating employees entitled to compensation as a result of injuries under this chapter, shall be paid out of a special fund created in the following manner: The employer, or if insured, his insurance carrier, shall pay into the vocational rehabilitation fund for every case of injury causing death, in which there are no persons entitled to compensation, the sum of five hundred dollars. The state treasurer shall be the custodian of this special fund. ... \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The definition is as follows: \"Insurance carrier' shall include the state fund, stock corporations or mutual associations with which employers have insured, and employers permitted to pay compensation directly. ...'

CO.(1930)\n\nArgued: October 28, 1930Decided: November 24, 1930\n\n\n\n\n\n[282 U.S. 10, 12]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. B. L. Catron, of Springfield, Ill., and Oscar E. Carlstrom, of Chicago, Ill., for appellant.\n Messrs. Josiah Whitnel, of East St. Louis, Ill., and J. R. Turney, of St. Louis, Mo., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought on July 21, 1927, by St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company to restrain the enforcement of a statute of the state of Illinois (General Corporation Act,  107 (Smith-Hurd Rev. St. 1927, c. 32 )), providing for the payment of a minimum franchise tax, upon the ground that the statute as applied to the complainant violated the commerce clause (article 1,  8, cl. 3), and the due process and equal protection clauses, of the Federal Constitution. (Amendment 14,  1). The bill of complaint prayed for both a preliminary and a permanent injunction against the defendant, Secretary of State of Illinois, from instituting any proceedings to assess the tax or to enforce any of the prohibitions or penalties prescribed in case of refusal to pay.\n On July 22, 1927, the complainant made a motion for a temporary restraining order in accordance with the prayer of the bill. On the same day, District Judge FitzHenry entered an order enjoining the defendant from re- \n\n[282 U.S. 10, 13]\n\u00a0\n voking the complainant's certificate of authority, from hindering the complainant in transacting its business in the state of Illinois, and from taking any steps for the enforcement of penalties, pending the determination of the application for an interlocutory injunction. While this order was in force, the defendant, on November 4, 1927, moved to dismiss the bill for want of equity. This motion was heard and granted by District Judge FitzHenry, sitting alone, and on June 7, 1928, he entered a decree dismissing the bill and dissolving the restraining order. 27 F.(2d) 1005\n\n\n On an appeal by the complainant from this decree, the Circuit Court of Appeals, holding the statute, which laid the tax, to be invalid under the Federal Constitution, reversed the decree and remanded the cause with directions to enter a decree in accordance with the views expressed in its opinion. 30 F.(2d) 322. A petition for a rehearing was denied, and from the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals the present appeal is taken.\n The question is thus necessarily presented, although not raised by the parties, with respect to the validity of the decree entered in the District Court, and the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals to entertain the appeal from that decree, in the light of section 266 of the Judicial Code, as amended (U. S. Code, tit. 28,  380 (28 USCA  380)). The statute provides that no interlocutory injunction, restraining the action of any officer of a state in the enforcement of a statute of the state, or of an order made by an administrative board or commission pursuant to a state statute, shall be granted by any Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, or by any District Court, or by any Judge thereof, or by any Circuit Judge acting as District Judge, upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of the statute, unless the application for the injunction shall be heard and determined by three judges. When the application for such an injunction is presented to a justice or \n\n[282 U.S. 10, 14]\n\u00a0\n judge, he must immediately call to his assistance two other judges, as stated, but, if he is of opinion that irreparable loss may otherwise result to the complainant, he may grant a temporary restraining order which is to remain in force only until the hearing and determination of the application for an interlocutory injunction upon prescribed notice. An appeal may be taken to this Court from the order granting or denying, after notice and hearing, an interlocutory injunction in such case. By the amendment of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 938), the provision with respect to the presence of three judges was made to apply also to the final hearing in such suit in the District Court, and from the final decree, granting or denying a permanent injunction, a direct appeal lies to this Court.\n The decisions of this Court require the following conclusions as to the purpose and effect of the statute:\n First. By the statute in its original form, the Congress sought to make interference by interlocutory injunction with the enforcement of state legislation a matter for the adequate hearing and full deliberation which the presence of a court composed of three judges, as provided by the statute, was likely to secure. Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Company v. Public Service Commission, \n260 \nU.S. 212, 216\n, 43 S. Ct. 75. The gravity of this class of cases was recognized, and it was sought to minimize the delay incident to a review upon appeal from an order granting or denying an interlocutory injunction. Chicago Great Western Railway Company v. Kendall, \n266 \nU.S. 94, 97\n, 45 S. Ct. 55; Moore v. Fidelity & Deposit Company, \n272 \nU.S. 317, 321\n, 47 S. Ct. 105; Ex parte Collins, \n277 \nU.S. 565, 567\n, 48 S. Ct. 585. These purposes were not altered by the amendment of the statute, which was designed to end the anomalous situation in which a single judge might reconsider and decide questions already passed upon by three judges on the application for an interlocutory injunction. Patterson v. Mobile Gas Com- \n\n[282 U.S. 10, 15]\n\u00a0\n pany, \n271 \nU.S. 131, 136\n, 46 S. Ct. 445; Smith v. Wilson, \n273 \nU.S. 388, 390\n, 391 S., 47 S. Ct. 385.\n Second. The statute applies only where there is a substantial claim of invalidity under the Federal Constitution and where an application for an interlocutory injunction, for the purposes contemplated by the statute, is made and pressed. Ex parte Buder, \n271 \nU.S. 461, 463\n, 467 S., 46 S. Ct. 557; Ex parte Hobbs, \n280 \nU.S. 168, 172\n, 50 S. Ct. 83. The complainant has an election. If an interlocutory injunction is not sought, a single judge may hear and determine the case, and an appeal from the final decree will lie to the Circuit Court of Appeals. Judicial Code,  128 (U. S. Code, tit. 28,  225 (28 USCA  225)); Ex parte Buder, supra; Moore v. Fidelity & Deposit Company, supra; Smith v. Wilson, supra.\n Third. If an application for an interlocutory injunction is made and pressed to restrain the enforcement of a state statute, or of an administrative order made pursuant to a state statute, upon the ground that such enforcement would be in violation of the Federal Constitution, a single judge has no jurisdiction to entertain a motion to dismiss the bill on the merits. He is as much without power to dismiss the bill on the merits as he would be to grant either an interlocutory or a permanent injunction. His authority is strictly limited to granting, upon proper cause being shown, a temporary restraining order to be effective only pending the determination of the application for an interlocutory injunction. Upon making such an order, it is his duty immediately to call two other judges, as the statute directs, to assist him in hearing and determining that application. Ex parte Northern Pacific Railway Company, \n280 \nU.S. 142, 144\n, 50 S. Ct. 70.\n Fourth. If a single judge, thus acting without jurisdiction, undertakes to enter an interlocutory injunction or a final decree, either dismissing the bill on the merits or granting a permanent injunction, no appeal lies from such an order or decree to this Court, as \n\n[282 U.S. 10, 16]\n\u00a0\n the statute plainly contemplates such a direct appeal only in the case of an order or decree entered by a court composed of three judges in accordance with the statutory requirement. Nor does an appeal lie to the Circuit Court of Appeals from an order or decree thus entered by a District Judge without authority, for to sustain a review upon such an appeal would defeat the purpose of the statute by substituting a decree by a single judge and an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for a decree by three judges and a direct appeal to this Court.\n Accordingly, where a court of three judges should have been convened, and was not, this Court may issue a writ of mandamus to vacate the order or decree entered by the District Judge and directing him, or such other judge as may entertain the proceeding, to call to his aid two other judges for the hearing and determination of the application for an interlocutory injunction.

Soper (No. 1), \n270 \nU.S. 9\n, 46 S. Ct. 185.\n Fifth. It follows that, in the present case, no appeal lay to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and that court should have dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction. The \n\n[282 U.S. 10, 17]\n\u00a0\n bill prayed for a preliminary, as well as for a permanent, injunction. On filing the bill the complainant at once moved for a temporary restraining order in accordance with the prayer of the bill. The order granted by the District Judge recited that the complainant sought a temporary restraining order pending a hearing on an application for an interlocutory or preliminary injunction, and the order enjoined the enforcement of a state statute until the consideration and determination of that application. The application to restrain the enforcement of the state statute pending the suit was manifestly not withdrawn, but was continuously pressed in order to avoid the prohibitions and penalties imposed by the state law in case the tax in question was not paid. The District Judge, on granting the temporary restraining order, failed to call in two other judges to aid him in hearing and determining the application for the interlocutory injunction, and the restraining order was permitted to operate as an interlocutory injunction for several months and until the determination of the motion to dismiss the bill on the merits.\n The requirement of the statute has regard to substance and not to form. It matters not whether the injunction is called preliminary or interlocutory, or is styled a temporary restraining order, if it is granted to restrain the enforcement of state legislation and is continued in force until the hearing on the merits, without such restraint pending the suit being made the subject of consideration and determination by three judges as the statute requires. The temporary restraining order which the District Judge, acting alone, could grant is only to maintain the status quo, on proper cause being shown, for such time as may be necessary to obtain a decision upon the application for an interlocutory injunction by a court of three judges, which is to be immediately convened. \n\n[282 U.S. 10, 18]\n\u00a0\n As the proceeding in this suit fell within the provision of the statute, and the District Judge had no jurisdiction to hear the motion to dismiss the bill on the merits, the consent of the parties could not give validity to the decree or confer jurisdiction upon the Circuit Court of Appeals to entertain an appeal therefrom. United States v. Emholt, \n105 U.S. 414\n, 416; Parker v. Ormsby, \n141 \nU.S. 81, 86\n, 11 S. Ct. 912; Perez v. Fernandez, \n202 \nU.S. 80, 100\n, 26 S. Ct. 561; 443 Cans of Frozen Egg Product v. U.

Ct. 331.\n The remedy by mandamus to vacate the decree and to require the District Judge to call to his assistance two other judges, as directed by the statute, to hear the application for an interlocutory injunction, is still available. It is not necessary, however, that formal application should be made for such a writ, as the District Judge may not proceed to take the action which the writ, if issued, would require.\n When it appears, on an appeal to this Court from decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, that the latter court has acted without jurisdiction in entertaining the appeal from the District Court, the appropriate action of this Court is to reverse the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals and to remand the case with directions to dismiss the appeal to that court for want of jurisdiction.

STATE OF MISSISSIPPI(1930)\nNo. 28\nArgued: October 31, 1929Decided: February 24, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 390, 391]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William H. Watkins, of Jackson, Miss., and Warren Lee Guice, of Biloxi, Miss., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 390, 393]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James W. Cassedy, Jr., of Brook-haven, Miss., and E. C. Sharp, of Jackson, Miss., for appellee, pro hac vice by special leave of Court.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the State of Mississippi to collect a tax on distributors of gasoline of three and four cents respectively per gallon sold, according to the statute in force at the time of the sales. The defense was that the sales were in interstate commerce.\n The Supreme Court of the \n\n[280 U.S. 390, 394]\n\u00a0\n State upheld the tax, 119 So. 360, and the defendant, the Superior Oil Company, appealed to this Court on the ground that the statutes as applied violated the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. Article 1, section 8.\n The facts are as follows. The Superior Oil Company, a corporation created and doing business in Mississippi, sold gasoline to packers in Biloxi in that State and delivered it at the packers' wharves. The latter loaded the oil upon their own fishing boats and sent it out to the neighborhood of Grants Pass, Louisiana, where they delivered it to shrimp fishermen for use in fishing. The firshermen brought their catch back to Biloxi, sold it to the packers and were charged with the cost of the oil in account. The appellant received in each case from the purchaser what is called a bill of lading, signed by the master of the boat on which the oil was loaded and reading in part: 'Consigned to Gussie Fontaine Pkg. co. (or other purchasers). Destination: Grants Pass, La. By boat Frank Louis, owned or operated by Gussie Fontaine Pkg. Co.' The instrument then provided that 'the property consigned herein remains the property of said Superior Oil Company until it shall be delivered to consignee or consignee's agent at point of destination,' with provisions throwing all risks upon the purchasers. The seller of course paid no freight. The document seems to have had no other use than, as the Supreme Court of Mississippi said, to try to convert a domestic transaction into one of interstate commerce. There was no consignee at the point of destination. The goods were delivered to the so-called consignee before they started, and were in its hands throughout. There was no point of destination for delivering of the oil but merely a neighborhood in which the packers that had bought it and already held it expected to sell it again. The document hardly can affect the case, because it is 'not within the power of the \n\n[280 U.S. 390, 395]\n\u00a0\n parties by the form of their contract to convert what was exclusively a local business, subject to state control, into an interstate commerce business, protected by the commerce clause'; Browning v. Waycross, \n233 \nU.S. 16, 23\n, 34 S. Ct. 578, 580; at least when the contract achieves nothing else.\n The importance of the commerce clause to the Union of course is very great. But it also is important to prevent that clause being used to deprive the States of their lifeblood by a strained interpretation of facts. We may admit that this case is near the line. There was a regular course of business known to the appellant, that took the gasoline into another State, and if by mutual agreement the oil had been put into the hands of a third person, a common carrier, for transportation to Louisiana the mere possibility that the vendor might be able to induce the carrier to forego his rights might not have been enough to keep the transaction out of interstate commerce. A. G. Spalding & Bros. v. Edwards, \n262 \nU.S. 66\n, 43 S. Ct. 485 (a case of foreign export, see Sonneborn Brothers v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506, 520\n, 521 S., 43 S. Ct. 643). But here the gasoline was in the hands of the purchaser to do with as it liked, and there was nothing that in any way committed it to sending the oil to Louisiana except its own wishes. If it had bought bait for fishing that it intended to do itself, the purchase would not have been in interstate commerce because the fishing grounds were known by both parties to be beyond the State line. A distinction has been taken between sales made with a view to a certain result and those made simply with indifferent knowledge that the buyer contemplates that result. Louisville & Nashville, R. Co. v. Parker, \n242 \nU.S. 13, 14\n, 37 S. Ct. 4; Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers, \n222 \nU.S. 55, 62\n, 32 S. Ct. 20, Ann. Cas. 1913A, 1285. The only purpose of the vendor here was to escape taxation. It was not taxed in Louisiana and hoped not to be in Mississippi. The fact that it desired to evade the law, as it is called, is immaterial, because the very meaning of a line in the law - \n\n[280 U.S. 390, 396]\n\u00a0\n is that you intentionally may go as close to it as you can if you do not pass it. Bullen v. Wisconsin, \n240 \nU.S. 625, 630\n, 631 S., 36 S. Ct. 473. But on the other hand the desire to make its act an act in commerce among the States was equally unimportant when it was apparent that the buyer's journey to Louisiana was accidental so far as the appellant was concerned. It is a matter of proximity and degree as to which minds will differ, but it seems to us that the connection of the seller with the steps taken by the buyer after the sale was too remote to save the seller from the tax. Dramatic circumstances, such as a great universal stream of grain from the State of purchase to a market elsewhere, may affect the legal conclusion by showing the manifest certainty of the destination and exhibiting grounds of policy that are absent here.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice BUTLER dissent. \n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSURPLUS TRADING CO. v. COOK(1930)\nNo. 14\nArgued: November 21, 1928Decided: June 2, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 647, 648]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George D. Cherry and G. B. Rose, both of Little Rock, Ark., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Sam. T. Poe and H. W. Applegate, both of Little Rock, Ark., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 647, 649]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit by the sheriff and collector of taxes of Pulaski county, Ark., to enforce payment by the Surplus Trading Company of taxes for the years 1922 and 1923, with penalties, upon certain personal property. The chancery court, in which the suit was brought, gave a decree for the defendant, and on appeal the Supreme Court of the state affirmed that decree as to the tax for 1923 and reversed it as to the tax for 1922, with a direction that a decree be entered for the plaintiff for the amount of that tax and the penalty, both of which were specified in the record. Haynie v. Surplus Trading Co., 174 Ark. 507, 297 S. W. 822.\n The defendant resisted the collection of the tax for 1922 on the ground that the personal property on which it was laid was located within Camp Pike, an army mobilization, training, and supply station of the United States laying within the exterior limits of Pulaski county, the lands in which had been purchased by the United States, with the consent of the Legislature of the state, for the purpose of establishing, erecting, and maintaining such an army station; and that the tax laws of the state could not be applied to property so located \n\n[281 U.S. 647, 650]\n\u00a0\n without bringing them, in that regard, into conflict with article 1,  8, cl. 17, of the Constitution of the United States, which prescribes that the Congress shall have power 'to exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, Dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings.'\n The property attempted to be taxed consisted of a large quantity of woolen blankets which the defendant, a New York concern, purchased from the United States at an advertised sale a few days before the day fixed by the state law for listing personal property for taxation, and which in much the greater part was on that day in the army storehouses within Camp Pike awaiting shipment therefrom.\n The Supreme Court of the state, although recognizing that the status of Camp Pike was as just stated and that the property on which the tax was laid was in much the greater part located therein, rejected the contention that the tax laws of the state could not be applied to property so located consistently with the constitutional provision cited.\n It is not unusual for the United States to own within a state lands which are set apart and used for public purposes. Such ownership and use without more do not withdraw the lands from the jurisdiction of the state. On the contrary, the lands remain part of her territory and within the operation of her laws, save that the latter cannot affect the title of the United States or embarrass it in using the lands or interfere with its right of disposal. \n\n[281 U.S. 647, 651]\n\u00a0\n A typical illustration is found in the usual Indian reservation set apart within a state as a place where the United States may care for its Indian wards and lead them into habits and ways of civilized life. Such reservations are part of the state within which they lie, and her laws, civil and criminal, have the same force therein as elsewhere within her limits, save that they can have only restricted application to the Indian wards. Private property within such a reservation, if not belonging to such Indians, is subject to taxation under the laws of the state. Another illustration is found in two classes of military reservations within a state-one where the reservation, although established before the state is admitted into the Union, is not excepted from her jurisdiction at the time of her admission; and the other where the reservation, although established after the admission of the state, is established either upon lands set apart by the United States from its public domain or upon lands purchased by it for the purpose without the consent of the Legislature of the state. In either case, unless there be a later and affirmative cession of jurisdiction by the state, the reservation is a part of her territory and within the field of operation of her laws, save that they can have no operation which would impair the effective use of the reservation for the purposes for which it is maintained. If there be private property within such a reservation which is not held or used as an incident of military service it may be subjected to taxation like other private property within the state.\n As respects such a military reservation-that is, one which is neither excepted from the jurisdiction of the state at the time of her admission nor established upon lands purchased therefor with the consent of her Legislature-the state undoubtedly may cede her jurisdiction to the United States and may make the cession either absolute or qualified as to her may appear desirable, provided the qualification is consistent with the purposes \n\n[281 U.S. 647, 652]\n\u00a0\n for which the reservation is maintained and is accepted by the United States. And, where such a cession is made and accepted, it will be determinative of the jurisdiction of both the United States and the state within the reservation.\n But Camp Pike is not in the same class with any of the reservations of which we have spoken and should not be confused with any of them. Nor should it be confused with military or other reservations within a territory of the United States. It is not questioned, nor could it well be, that Camp Pike comes within the words 'forts, magazines, arsenals, dock- yards, and other needful buildings' in the constitutional provision. The land therefor was purchased by the United States with the consent of the Legislature of the state in 1917. The constitutional provision says that Congress shall have power to exercise 'exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever' over a place so purchased for such a purpose. 'Exclusive legislation' is consistent only with exclusive jurisdiction. It can have no other meaning as to the seat of government, and what it means as to that it also means as to forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, etc. That no divided jurisdiction respecting the seat of government is intended is not only shown by the terms employed, but is a matter of public history. Why as to forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, etc., is the power given made to depend on purchase with the consent of the Legislature of the state if the jurisdiction of the United States is not to be exclusive and that of the state excluded?\n The question is not an open one. It long has been settled that, where lands for such a purpose are purchased by the United States with the consent of the state Legislature, the jurisdiction theretofore residing in the state passes, in virtue of the constitutional provision, to the United States, thereby making the jurisdiction of the latter the sole jurisdiction. \n\n[281 U.S. 647, 653]\n\u00a0\n The first reported decision on the question is Commonwealth v. Clary, 8 Mass. 72. The question there was whether the law of Massachusetts restricting the sale of intoxicating liquors to persons procuring and paying for licenses could be applied to an arsenal of the United States in Springfield, the land for which had been purchased with the consent of the commonwealth. The court held that the license law could not be so applied, and in that connection said, page 77, of 8 Mass.:\n'An objection occurred to the minds of some members of the court, that if the laws of the commonwealth have no force within this territory, the inhabitants thereof cannot exercise any civil or political privileges, under the laws of Massachusetts, within the town of Springfield. We are agreed that such consequence necessarily follows; and we think that no hardship is thereby imposed on those inhabitants:-because they are not interested in any elections made within the state, or held to pay any taxes imposed by its authority, nor bound by any of its laws.-And it might be very inconvenient to the United States, to have their labourers, artificers, officers and other persons employed in their service, subjected to the services required by the commonwealth of the inhabitants of the several towns.'\n\n In Mitchell v. Tibbetts, 17 Pick. (Mass.) 298, the question was whether a law of Massachusetts relating to vessels bringing stone within that commonwealth could be applied to a vessel landing stone at the Charlestown Navy Yard, the land for which had been purchased by the United States with the consent of the commonwealth. The court ruled that the law could not be so applied, because the commonwealth no longer had any jurisdiction over the Navy Yard.\n In United States v. Cornell, Fed. Cas. No. 14,867, Mr. Justice Story, at circuit, held that a state consenting to the purchase by the United States of land for a fort was \n\n[281 U.S. 647, 654]\n\u00a0\n without jurisdiction of a public offense subsequently committed therein, and he stated his reasons as follows:\n'The constitution of the United States declares that congress shall have power to exercise 'exclusive legislation' in all 'cases whatsoever' over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards and other needful buildings. When therefore a purchase of land for any of these purposes is made by the national government, and the state legislature has given its consent to the purchase, the land so purchased by the very terms of the constitution ipso facto falls within the exclusive legislation of congress, and the state jurisdiction is completely ousted. This is the necessary result, for exclusive jurisdiction is the attendant upon exclusive legislation; and the consent of the state legislature is by the very terms of the constitution, by which all the states are bound, and to which all are parties, a virtual surrender and cession of its sovereignty over the place. Nor is there anything novel in this construction. It is under the like terms in the same clause of the constitution that exclusive jurisdiction is now exercised by congress in the District of Columbia; for if exclusive jurisdiction and exclusive legislation do not import the same thing, the states could not cede or the United States accept for the purposes enumerated in this clause, any exclusive jurisdiction.'\n\n Of like import is the opinion of Mr. Justice Woodbury given at circuit in United States v. Ames, Fed. Cas. No. 14,441.\n In Sinks v. Reese, 19 Ohio St. 306, 2 Am. Rep. 397, which related to lands purchased with the consent of the Legislature of Ohio for a national home for disabled volunteer soldiers, a question arose respecting the effect of a proviso in the act of consent declaring that nothing in the act should be construed to prevent residents of the home from exer- \n\n[281 U.S. 647, 655]\n\u00a0\n cising the right of suffrage within the township in which the home was located. The Supreme Court of the state held that, through the purchase of the site for the home with the consent of the state Legislature, the United States acquired exclusive jurisdiction over the site, and that the residents of the home, being within that exclusive jurisdiction, were not residents of the state and therefore not entitled to vote therein.\n In Foley v. Shriver, 81 Va. 568, it was held of lands within the state of Virginia, purchased with her consent for another national home for disabled volunteer soldiers, that, in virtue of the constitutional provision, the purchase invested the United States with complete jurisdiction of the lands to the exclusion of the state, so that they were 'no longer a part of the State of Virginia.' And there was a like ruling in Bank of Phoebus v. Byrum, 110 Va. 708, 67 N. E. 349, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 436, 135 Am. St. Rep. 953.\n In State v. Mack, 23 Nev. 359, 47 P. 763, 765, 62 Am. St. Rep. 811, which related to a purchase by the United States with the state's consent of land for a post office and federal court building, it was held, notwithstanding a provision in the act of consent purporting to 'except the administration of the criminals laws of the state,' that the purchase operated under the constitutional provision to pass full jurisdiction over the land to the United States and to divest the state of all jurisdiction thereover, criminal as well as civil.\n Like views of the operation of the constitutional provision are stated by Chancellor Kent in his Commentaries, vol. 1, pp. 429-431, and by Judge Story in his work on the Constitution (5th Ed.) vol. 2,  1224-1227.\n In Fort Leavenworth R. Co. v. Lowe, \n114 U.S. 525\n, page 532, 5 S. Ct. 995, 999, this court said: 'When the title is acquired by purchase by consent of the legislatures of the states, the federal jurisdiction is exclusive of all state authority. This follows from the declaration of the constitution that congress shall have \n\n[281 U.S. 647, 656]\n\u00a0\n 'like authority' over such places as it has over the district which is the seat of government; that is, the power of 'exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever.' Broader or clearer language could not be used to exclude all other authority than that of congress.'\n And, after reviewing some of the earlier cases here cited, the court further said, page 537 of 114 U. S., 5 S. Ct. 995, 1002: 'These authorities are sufficient to support the proposition, which follows naturally from the language of the constitution, that no other legislative power than that of congress can be exercised over lands, within a State, purchased by the United States, with her consent for one of the purposes designated; and that such consent, under the constitution, operates to exclude all other legislative authority.'\n And the view thus expressed was given approving recognition in our recent decision in United States v. Unzueta, \n280 \nU.S. 138\n, 50 S. Ct. 284, 285, 74 L. Ed. - (decided April 14, 1930) where it is said that, where the United States purchases lands by the consent of the Legislature of the state within which they are situated for the purposes named in the constitutional provision, 'the Federal jurisdiction is exclusive of all State authority.'\n Apparently some of the cases to which we have referred were not brought to the attention of the Supreme Court of Arkansas. In its opinion it appears to have been guided largely by cases dealing with reservations in territories and with reservations in states of lands which were not purchased by the United States with the consent of the states. Such cases are not in point, for they do not turn on the constitutional provision which is of controlling influence in cases like this. Another matter to which that court attached some importance is that the act by which the Legislature consented to the purchase of the site for Camp Pike declares that the state 'releases and relinquishes her right to tax' the lands and improvements during the ownership of the United States. Laws Ark. \n\n[281 U.S. 647, 657]\n\u00a0\n 1903, No. 180, p. 346. These words of release it is argued disclose a purpose to reserve the power to tax, save as to the lands and improvements. But to this we do not assent. The words are ill-adapted to expressing such a purpose-so much so that, had it existed, there can be little doubt that it would have been stated differently. Not only so, but to construe the release as suggested would lead to a serious question respecting the validity of the release and would bring it into conflict with the preceding section, which directly states that the state 'hereby consents to the purchase' of the site, and 'the jurisdiction of this State within and over' the site 'is hereby ceded' to the United States. The release is not in form or substance a proviso, but is an affirmative provision inserted as an independent section, and we think it means what it says and no more. That the Legislature understood how to use a saving clause or proviso is evident from the following, which appears at the end of the first section: 'Provided, that this grant of jurisdiction shall not prevent execution of any process of this State, civil or criminal, upon any person who may be on said premises.' Such a proviso is common to nearly all acts giving consent to purchase, and is regarded, says Chancellor Kent, as amounting, when accepted, to 'an agreement of the new sovereign to permit the free exercise of such process, as being quoad hoc his own process.' Kent's Commentaries, vol. 1, p. 430.\n For the reasons which have been stated, we are of opinion that the Supreme Court of the state erred in holding that her tax laws could be applied to personal property within Camp Pike consistently with section 8, cl. 17, of article 1 of the Constitution, and therefore that the judgment of that court must be reversed.\n But to avoid any misapprehension it is well to state that our ruling is limited to the blankets which were within Camp Pike on May 1, 1922, the day fixed for \n\n[281 U.S. 647, 658]\n\u00a0\n listing personal property for assessment. We are led to make this statement because the record suggests, if it does not show, that on that day 21,235 of the blankets purchased by the plaintiff were held by it in a private warehouse in Little Rock, the county seat of Pulaski county, and 64,371 was the number remaining in the government storehouses at Camp Pike. Whether the assessment which was on the whole can be proportionally sustained as to the part in Little Rock so that the plaintiff will be charged with only such portion of the tax as pertains to that part of the blankets is a question of state law on which we intimate no opinion.\n The judgment will be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","121":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTAGG BROS. & MOORHEAD v.

Gen., for appellees.\n\n\n[280 U.S. 420, 431]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Packers and Stockyards Act, August 15, 1921, c. 64,  301-316, 42 Stat. 159, 163-168; U. S. C. tit. 7,  201-217 (7 USCA  201-217), declares that persons engaged in the business of buying or selling in interstate commerce live stock at a stockyard on a commission basis are 'market agencies'; requires such agencies to furnish their services upon reasonable request, without discrimination and at reasonable rates; and confers upon the Secretary of Agriculture the power to determine what are the just and reasonable rates or charges for their services. The Secretary prescribed a tariff of maximum charges for such services at the Omaha Stockyards, effective January 1, 1927. This suit was brought in the federal court for Nebraska, under section 316 (7 USCA  217), to enjoin the enforcement of that order and to set it aside. Fifty-eight concerns, all registered under the act as such market agencies, and together comprising the entire membership of the Omaha Livestock Exchange, joined as plaintiffs. The United States, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Attorney General, and the United States Attorney for Nebraska were made defendants. The prayers were that the order be declared null and void, and that the defendants be enjointed from enforcing it by canceling the registration of the agencies, or by instituting proceedings to enforce the penalties prescribed by the act for violation of an order, or by other means. There were also prayers for a restraining order and for an interlocutory injunction. Compare Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495\n, 42 S. Ct. 397, 23 A. L. R. 229.\n The occasion for the Secretary's order was this: There is no competition among the Omaha market agencies as to rates, since the Exchange rules require all members to \n\n[280 U.S. 420, 432]\n\u00a0\n make the same charges for their services. As required by section 306 of the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 USCA  207), the Omaha market agencies had filed with the Packers and stockyards Administration at Washington a schedule of charges known as Omaha Live Stock Exchange tariff No. 1. On January 16, 1926, they filed a new schedule, known as tariff no. 2, which introduced higher rates to become effective January 26, 1926. The Secretary of Agriculture, acting on his own motion, issued, on January 25, an order suspending the operation of the proposed schedule; and gave to the market agencies and others concerned notice of public hearings to be held before an examiner of the Packers and Stockyards Administration, under title 3 of the act (7 USCA  201-217), to inquire into the reasonableness of the new Schedule. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n The hearings before the Examiner extended over many months. The market agencies participated through counsel, but introduced little evidence. The Government introduced much. The evidence before the Secretary occupies, in condensed form, 532 pages of the printed record. It consists of the testimony of 33 witnesses and 102 exhibits, including 59 special audits of the books of the several plaintiffs. Upon that record and the report of the Examiner, the case was argued orally by counsel before the Secretary. He made a report which occupies 20 pages of the printed record. His order was based on the findings therein contained.\n The application for an interlocutory injunction was made before three judges, pursuant to the provisions of the Urgent Deficiencies Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219, 220, U. S. C. tit. 28,  47, 28 USCA  47, which, by section 316 of the Packers and Stockyards Act, are made applicable to proceedings brought to restrain or annul orders of the \n\n[280 U.S. 420, 433]\n\u00a0\n Secretary. Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495, 512\n, 42 S. Ct. 397, 23 A. L. R. 229. At that hearing, the Government consented that the interlocutory injunction should issue. Upon the filing of the answer, a special master was appointed by the three judges to hear the evidence and report his conclusions to the court. The master admitted, in addition to the record before the Secretary, oral evidence which, in condensed form, occupies 84 pages of the printed record, and 24 elaborate exhibits. Relying in part on this new evidence, he recommended that the injunction be made permanent. The case was then heard by the three judges on final hearing, upon exceptions to the master's report and a motion to confirm. That court also held the additional evidence admissible. After considering it in connection with that which had been introduced before the Secretary, the court found for the defendants and entered a final decree dissolving the interlocutory injunction and dismissing the bill. (D. C.) 29 F. (2d) 750. The District Judge allowed an appeal to this Court under section 238( 4) of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229,  1, 43 Stat. 936, 938, U. S. C. tit. 28,  345(4), 28 USCA  345(4). 2\n The plaintiffs conceded below that, being engaged in interstate commerce at public stockyards, they are subject to some regulation by Congress. But they claimed that the order is void, in whole or in part, on five grounds. That the act does not purport to confer upon the Secretary power to issue an order prescribing commission charges for market agencies and directing their observance in the future. That, if the act be construed as confer- \n\n[280 U.S. 420, 434]\n\u00a0\n ring such authority, it exceeds the constitutional power of the Federal Government, because it is not a regulation of commerce, and violates the Fifth Amendment, because the charges to be fixed are those for personal services. That so much of the order as reduces the charges below those of tariff No. 1 is void, because it was outside the scope of the Secretary's inquiry, as defined in the notice given by him. That the evidence presented to the Secretary was not sufficient to establish that the charges contained in either tariff No. 1 or tariff No. 2 were unreasonable or discriminatory; or that the schedule prescribed by the Secretary would adequately compensate the market agencies for their services and disbursements. That the rates in force prior to the hearing were not excessive, unreasonable or discriminatory; and that the charges prescribed by the Secretary are unreasonable and confiscatory.\n In this Court 27 specific errors are assigned, although some were not pressed in argument. One assignment attacks the construction given to the Act. One attacks its constitutionality in so far as it purports to authorize the Secretary to fix plaintiffs' commission charges. Fifteen assignments attack the findings of the Secretary on the grounds that the evidence before him was not sufficient to sustain them, or that he erred in making specific findings, or that he erred in ruling on the admissibility of evidence and on the effect given to evidence, or that he erred in his processes of reasoning. Seven relate to the lower court's treatment of the additional evidence introduced before the master. One assignment attacks the legality of the order, in so far as it reduces the charges below those of tariff No. 1, on the ground that it was beyond the scope of the inquiry. One attacks the order on the ground that it is confessedly confiscatory as to some of the plaintiffs and cannot be sustained except by fixing the number of plaintiffs entitled to carry on the \n\n[280 U.S. 420, 435]\n\u00a0\n business, or by eliminating some plaintiffs for the purpose of increasing the compensation of those remaining. And one assignment attacks the order on the ground that it is confiscatory as to all the plaintiffs.\n First. The contention that Congress did not purport to empower the Secretary to issue an order prescribing the charges of market agencies is without substance. The language used was apt to confer the power. The Committee of the House declared in terms that it did so, when it reported the bill. \n3\n The executive department charged with the duty of enforcing the act so interpreted it. This Court assumed in Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495, 514\n, 42 S. Ct. 397, 23 A. L. R. 229, and Chicago Board of Trade v. Olsen, \n262 \nU.S. 1, 34\n, 43 S. Ct. 470, that the power had been conferred. The Maximum Rate Cases, Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 \nU.S. 184\n, 16 S. Ct. 700, Id., \n167 \nU.S. 479\n, 17 S. Ct. 896, Interstate Commerce Commission v. Alabama Midland R. Co., \n168 \nU.S. 144\n, 18 S. Ct. 45, upon which appellants rely, lend no support to their contention.\n The order here in question resulted from a proceeding begun under title 3,  306. Subdivision (a) of that section requires the agencies to file with the Secretary their schedules of rates. Subdivision (e) authorizes the Secretary, upon complaint or on his own motion, to suspend a new rate pending a hearing as to its lawfulness; and, after the hearing, to make such order with reference thereto as would be proper in a proceeding initiated after the rate had become effective. Subdivision (g) makes any agency which fails to comply with any order made under this section liable to a penalty recoverable in a \n\n[280 U.S. 420, 436]\n\u00a0\n civil action; and subdivision (h) provides for a fine and imprisonment in cases of willful violation.\n Section 310 of the same title (7 USCA  211) provides that whenever, after a full hearing, the Secretary is of opinion that any rate 'of a stockyard owner or market agency' is unreasonable, he may (a) fix the charge to be thereafter observed and (b) make an order that 'such owner or operator' shall not thereafter 'collect any rate or charge for the furnishing of stockyard services other than the rate or charge so prescribed.' Plaintiffs urge that subdivision (a) confers only the power to declare what rates shall be reasonable, and that this declaration is effective only for purposes of reparation, as prima facie proof of such claims; that the power to compel observance of such rates in the future by enforcement of the penalties provided in section 314 (7 USCA  215) is granted solely in subdivision (b); that this subdivision applies only to owners or operators of stockyards-not to all market agencies; and that, therefore, they are entitled to an injunction against the enforcement of the penalties, even though such an injunction would not finally dispose of this litigation.\n The argument is highly strained. There is nothing in section 310, or elsewhere in the act, evidencing a purpose to exclude market agencies from subdivision (b), and to restrict the power of regulation to but a part of the 'stockyard services.' The term 'operator' in section 310 (b) (7 USCA  211(b), is an apt designation of one who conducts a market agency at a stockyard. An operator of a stockyard is covered by the word 'owner' under the express definition in section 201(a), 7 USCA  191(a).\n Second. The contention that the act, if construed as authorizing the order assailed, is void under the due process clause, is likewise unsound. It rests upon the fact that the services for which the Secretary's order fixes the charges are practically the personal services of brokers. \n\n[280 U.S. 420, 437]\n\u00a0\n Some of the market agencies are corporations; some, partnerships; some are individually owned. The capital needed in the conduct of their business is small. It is said that the business is wholly one of skill and labor, and that the commission man's only implements of trade are a horse on which he rides in the stockyards and a desk on which he keeps his accounts. The Union Stockyards are owned by a separate corporation in which the plaintiffs have no interest and which has no interest in the commissions charged by them. But each agency occupies a certain space in the yards and Exchange building, for which an annual or monthly rental is paid. When a producer, wishes to sell his live stock on the Exchange, he ships it by rail or motor truck, or drives it on foot, to an agency at the stockyards. After the stock is unloaded, it is driven by the agency to its pens, sorted, watered, fed and offered by it for sale. The feed is provided by the stockyards corporation on order of the agency, and a separate charge is made therefor by the corporation. When a purchaser is found, the stock is driven to the yard scales and weighed. Responsibility passes to the purchaser, or to the agency acting for him, as the stock is taken off the scales. Shipments are generally sold on the day of delivery, and payments are made on the same day or the next morning. The agency remits the proceeds to the shippers at once, after deducting its commissions, freight, yardage, feed, inspection, and other charges.\n The argument is that to prescribe a common maximum of earning power for commission men, who differ between themselves in the length of their experience, their relative aptitude for the work and their individual industry is to penalize the skillful for the benefit of the unskillful; that in legislative price fixing there are vital distinctions, from the constitutional standpoint, between property and the use of property, on the one hand, and personal serv- \n\n[280 U.S. 420, 438]\n\u00a0\n ices, on th other; that property originates with the state and reverts to the state, whereas, liberty-freedom to contract as to personal services-is a prerequisite to the very organization of a government of the people; that it is impossible to ascertain what is a fair return for personal services because liberty, unlike property, has no actual or theoretical equivalent in money; that while property may to taken for a public use upon payment of just compensation, liberty-personal services-may not be so taken, except in time of war or as a punishment for crime; that, since personal services cannot be taken for a public use, they cannot be said to be dedicated to a public use or devoted to a public service; that this rate fixing is in essence wage fixing, since the stockyard services performed by the plaintiffs involve only skill and labor, and that wage fixing was held to be beyond the power of Congress, Adkins v. Children's Hospital, \n261 \nU.S. 525\n, 43 S. Ct. 394; that, even if not obnoxious as an attempt at wage fixing, the limitation of charges for personal service is precluded by Tyson & Bro. v. Banton, \n273 \nU.S. 418\n, 47 S. Ct. 426, 58 A. L. R. 1236 and Ribnik v. McBride, \n277 \nU.S. 350\n, 48 S. Ct. 545, 56 A. L. R. 1327\n\n\n It is true that performance of the specific work done by the plaintiffs does not require them to invest extensive capital. But it is essential that they employ the valuable property of the stockyards corporation, for which a charge is ultimately made to the shipper or buyer. The mere division of the stockyard services between the stockyards corporation and the market agencies does not deprive Congress of a power of regulation which it otherwise would have had. But the constitutionality of the power conferred does not rest upon so narrow a ground. There is nothing in the nature of monopolistic personal services which makes it impossible to fix reasonable charges to be made therefor; and there is nothing in the Constitution which limits the Government's power of regulation to businesses which employ substantial capital. This \n\n[280 U.S. 420, 439]\n\u00a0\n court did not hold in Tyson & Bro. v. Banton and Ribnik v. McBride that charges for personal services cannot be regulated. The question upon which this Court divided in those cases was whether the services there sought to be regulated were then affected with a public interest. Whether a business is of that class depends, not upon the amount of capital it employs, but upon the character of the service which those who are conducting it engage to render.\n Plaintiffs perform an indispensable service in the interstate commerce in live stock. They enjoy a substantial monopoly at the omaha Stock Yards. They had eliminated rate competition and had substituted therefor rates fixed by agreement among themselves, without consulting the shippers and others who pay the rates. They had bound themselves to maintain uniform charges, regardless of the differences in experience, skill, and industry. The purpose of the regulation attacked is to prevent their service from thus becoming an undue burden upon, and obstruction of, that commerce. Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495, 515\n, 516 S., 42 S. Ct. 397, 23 A. L. R. 229; Chicago Board of Trade v. Olsen, \n262 \nU.S. 1, 34\n, 43 S. Ct. 470. There is here no attempt to fix any one's wages or to limit any one's net income. Differences in skill, industry, and experience will continue to be factors n the earning power of the several plaintiffs. For, the order fixes only the charges to be made in individual transactions.\n Third. The claim that the order is void for lack of proper notice, in so far as it reduces charges below tariff No. 1, is unsupported. The contention is that the notice of the hearing before the Examiner and the Secretary did not apprise plaintiffs of the Secretary's intention to fix a new schedule, but led them to believe that the hearings would be confined to the inquiry whether tariff No. 2 was excessive and that, if it was found to be so, tariff No. 1 would be left in force; whereas the tariff prescribed \n\n[280 U.S. 420, 440]\n\u00a0\n by the Secretary carries rates lower than tariff No. 1. The notice given by the Secretary was neither defective nor misleading. It informed the plaintiffs that a hearing would be had under title 3 of the act. It apprised them that they would have 'the right to appear and show cause why a further order in respect to the said schedule of rates and charges should not be made' pursuant to title 3. Section 306(e) of that title (7 USCA  207(e) provides that upon such a hearing the Secretary may make any order with reference to the proposed schedule which he could make in a proceeding initiated after the schedule had become effective. And section 310 of the same title expressly empowers the Secretary in any such proceeding to fix the just and reasonable rate to be charged in the future, without limiting him to a determination of the lawfulness of a proposed rate. The plaintiffs should have anticipated, therefore, that the Secretary would fix a new rate, if the evidence before him would lead him to believe that such a course was proper and desirable.\n Fourth. The claim that the order is void because unsustained by the evidence before the Secretary, or because of specific errors in rulings or findings, lacks merit. The Secretary found that monopolistic power was exercised by the plaintiffs without the usually attendant economy of minimizing expenditures for business getting; that the operating costs of the several agencies for the performance of similar services varied widely; that some of the expenses were wasteful and unnecessary; that the profit yielded by tariff No. 2, on the basis of the estimated reasonable cost of conducting the business, allowing for reasonable salary expenses, advertising costs, overhead, Exchange assessments and dues, and interest at the rate of 7 per cent. on the invested capital, was unreasonable; that the tariff was unduly complicated and confusing, not only to shippers, but even to experienced employees of the agencies; that, because of the presence of maximum \n\n[280 U.S. 420, 441]\n\u00a0\n and minimum charges, and because of differences in rates based on the mode of delivery of the stock, its effect on different shippers was unjust, inequitable, and not based on any reasonable differences in the cost or value of the service performed; that it unjustly favored traders and speculators by prescribing half the regular commission charges for buying the selling for their account; that, for these reasons, the operation of tariff No. 2 should be suspended, and there should be substituted the schedule drawn by the Secretary, which prescribed generally lower charges, eliminated the several unjust discriminations, and yielded a reasonable return to the plaintiffs above the legitimate cost of their service. It is urged that there was not sufficient evidence before the Secretary to establish that the charges contained in either tariff No. 1 or tariff No. 2 were discriminatory or unreasonable, or that the schedule prescribed by the Secretary would adequately compensate the market agencies for their services and disbursements; that the Secretary confined the fixing of rates to Omaha, although relatively higher rates prevail under substantially similar circumstances in other markets and it was possible to fix rates for all competing markets; that his order is based upon the notion that the industry is suffering from an oversupply of market agencies, and that some of the plaintiffs should be eliminated therefrom; that it is based upon irrelevant considerations of the economic condition of plaintiffs' patrons; that it resulted from a complete misunderstanding of the plaintiff's function and a disregard of the really controlling facts of the industry; that the prescribed rates are based upon an assumed cost of the service which disallowed expenses actually incurred and omitted basic cost items such as some additional depreciation, bad debts, supervision, going concern value, and additional items of invested capital; and that the revenues estimated to result from the recommenced increase of the charges to traders \n\n[280 U.S. 420, 442]\n\u00a0\n and speculators will not be realized because the increase will drive the traders and speculators from the market.\n We find in the evidence before the Secretary ample support for the findings and the conclusion reached by him. It may be that some of the evidence was irrelevant or of little weight, and that some of the reasoning was not persuasive. But mere admission by an administrative tribunal of matters which, under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings, would be deemed incompetent, or mere error in reasoning upon evidence adduced, does not invalidate an order made by it. United States v. Abilene & Southern Ry., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 288\n, 44 S. Ct. 565; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Department of Public Works, \n268 \nU.S. 39, 44\n, 45 S. Ct. 412. It has been settled in cases arising under the Interstate Commerce Act that, if an order rests upon an erroneous rule of law, Interstate Commerce Commission v. Diffenbaugh, \n222 \nU.S. 42\n, 32 S. Ct. 22, or is based upon a finding made without evidence, Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 263\n, 44 S. Ct. 317, or upon evidence which clearly does not support it, Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 32 S. Ct. 108; New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 203\n, 43 S. Ct. 270; Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153, 166\n, 46 S. Ct. 452, the order must be set aside. These rules are applicable also to suits arising under the Packers and Stockyards Act. But the order here assailed is not subject to any of these infirmities.\n Fifth. With regard to the assignments of error based on the additional evidence introduced below, a question of practice requires consideration. After the defendants filed their answer, the plaintiffs moved for the appointment of a special master. The only grounds set forth in the motion were these: That the character and volume of the evidence before the Secretary was such that it would require for its due consideration long study and the aid of expert accountants; that it was necessary to take additional testimony from a large number of shippers to the \n\n[280 U.S. 420, 443]\n\u00a0\n Omaha market to show that the charges under tariff No. 2 were satisfactory to shippers, and that the charges prescribed by the Secretary would result in injury to the live stock business, by deteriorating the quality of the service; that it was necessary to introduce additional testimony and additional audits to show the effect of the rates prescribed by the Secretary on the business of the year 1926 and their continuing effect on the business of 1927; and that it was necessary to take additional testimony from a large number of the plaintiffs to show that, under the application of the rates prescribed by the Secretary, they will be unable to continue in business.\n The court granted the motion to appoint the master, and authorized him 'to rule upon the admission and exclusion of evidence, subject to the court's review of the same.' In its opinion on final decree, the court justified the admission of the evidence, and considered the same, on the ground that the notice of the hearings before the Examiner did not advise plaintiffs that the Secretary intended to fix a new schedule of rates. As we have shown above, the court erred in holding that the notice given was inadequate. But, if there had been a failure to give due notice, it would have been ground only for setting aside the order without inquiry into its merits, as having been made without notice and hearing. Such failure does not justity trying in the court, upon new evidence, the issues set forth in the motion to appoint the master.\n A proceeding under section 316 of the Packers and Stockyards Act is a judicial review, not a trial de novo. The validity of an order of the Secretary, like that of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, must be determined upon the record of the proceedings before him-save as there may be an exception of issues presenting claims of constitutional right, a matter which need not be considered or decided now. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 463, 466\n, 38 S. Ct. 141; compare \n\n[280 U.S. 420, 444]\n\u00a0\n Liscio v. Campbell (C. C. A.) 34 F.(2d) 646, 647; and see Prendergast v. New York Telephone Co., \n262 \nU.S. 43, 50\n, 43 S. Ct. 466; and Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, \n253 \nU.S. 287, 289\n, 40 S. Ct. 527. On all other issues his findings must be accepted by the court as conclusive, if the evidence before him was legally sufficient to sustain them and there was no irregularity in the proceeding. 4 To allow his findings to be attacked or supported in court by new evidence would substitute the court for the administrative tribunal as the rate-making body. Where it is believed that the Secretary erred in his findings because important evidence \n\n[280 U.S. 420, 445]\n\u00a0\n was not brought to his attention, the appropriate remedy is to apply for a rehearing before him or to institute new proceedings. He has the power and the duty to modify his order, if new evidence warrants the change. Compare Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 550\n, 32 S. Ct. 108. A rate order is not res judicata. Every rate order made may be superseded by another.\n Sixth. There is also a contention that the rates prescribed are not merely unsupported by the evidence, but are confiscatory; and that the order is therefore void. Whether the additional evidence before the master was admissible on the issue of confiscation presents a serious question of practice which was not argued by counsel. The lower court held the additional evidence admissible, and, after considering it, reached the conclusion that the charges prescribed are not unreasonably low or confiscatory. This conclusion of the lower court conforms, in our opinion, to the evidence, whether the examination be confined to that evidence which was received by the Secretary or be extended to include the additional evidence introduced before the master and the court. The question of the admissibility of the additional evidence on the issue of confiscation may, therefore, be passed, and it is passed, without decision.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As the Secretary's power to suspend a tariff pending a hearing is limited by section 306 to a period of 60 days, tariff No. 2 became operative on March 27, 1926. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In doing so, he also approved an appeal bond to operate as a supersedeas and granted a temporary injunction pending the appeal. This part of the order, being beyond the power of a single judge, was later vacated by him. Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Louisiana Public Service Commission, \n260 \nU.S. 212\n, 43 S. Ct. 75. An application for a stay made to the three judges was denied on February 11, 1929. It was not until then that the rates which had been prescribed by the Secretary on November 19, 1926, became operative. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Report No. 77, 67th Congress, First Session, on H. R. 6320, states at page 10, referring to title 3: '... The Secretary of Agriculture is given substantially the same jurisdiction over stockyard matters which the Interstate Commerce Commission has over railroads, including the power, after full hearing, to establish and enforce just and reasonable rates and charges for, and practices in connection with, the furnishing of stockyard services.' By the definitions contained in section 301(b) and (c), (7 USCA  201(b)(c), the term 'stockyard services' includes the services rendered by the plaintiffs. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The judicial review of rate orders in suits begun under the Urgent Deficiencies Act to set aside orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission does not differ in substance from that in suits instituted by the Commission under the Interstate Commerce Act to enforce its orders. The Act to Regulate Commerce, February 4, 1887, c. 104,  16, 24 Stat. 379, 384, 385 (49 USCA  16) specifically provided that, in proceedings to enforce orders of the Commission, its findings were to be merely prima facie evidence; and the Court was not to be restricted to the record before the Commission.

Clerks \n281 U.S. 548\n (1930) ]\n\n\n[281 U.S. 548, 551]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. H. Tallichet and H. M. Garwood, both of Houston, Tex ., for petitioners.\n\n\n[281 U.S. 548, 553]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John H. Crooker, of Houston, Tex., and Donald R. Richberg, of Chicago, Ill., for respondents. \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 554]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the District Court by the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees, Southern Pacific Lines in Texas and Louisiana, a voluntary association, and H. W. Harper, general chairman of its System Board of Adjustment, against the Texas & New Orleans Railroad Company and certain officers and agents of that company, to obtain an injunction restraining the defend- \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 555]\n\u00a0\n ants from interfering with, influencing, or coercing the clerical employees of the railroad company in the matter of their organization and designation of representatives for the purposes set forth in the Railway Labor Act of May 20, 1926, c. 347, 44 Stat. 577, U. S. C., Tit. 45,  151- 163 (45 USCA  151-163).\n The substance of the allegations of the bill of complaint was that the brotherhood, since its organization in September, 1918, had been authorized by a majority of the railway clerks in the employ of the railroad company (apart from general office employees) to represent them in all matters relating to their employment; that this representation was recognized by the railroad company before and after the application by the brotherhood in November, 1925, for an increase of the wages of the railway clerks and after the denial of that application by the railroad company and the reference of the controversy by the brotherhood to the United States Board of Mediation; that, while the controversy was pending before that board, the railroad company instigated the formation of a union of its railway clerks (other than general office employees) known as the 'Association of Clerical Employees-Southern Pacific Lines'; and that the railroad company had endeavored to intimidate members of the brotherhood and to coerce them to withdraw from it and to make the association their representative in dealings with the railroad company, and thus to prevent the railway clerks from freely designating their representatives by collective action.\n The District Court granted a temporary injunction. \n1\n Thereafter the railroad company recognized the Asso- \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 556]\n\u00a0\n ciation of Clerical Employees-Southern Pacific Lines, as the representative of the clerical employees of the company. The railroad company stated that this course was taken after a committee of the association had shown authorizations signed by those who were regarded as constituting a majority of the employees of the described class. The subsequent action of the railroad company and its officers and agents was in accord with this recognition of the association and the consequent nonrecogni- \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 557]\n\u00a0\n tion of the brotherhood. In proceedings to punish for contempt, the District Court decided that the railroad company and certain of its officers who were defendants had violated the order of injunction and completely nullified it. The court directed that, in order to purge themselves of this contempt, the railroad company and these officers should completely 'disestablish the Association of Clerical Employees,' as it was then constituted as the recognized representative of the clerical employees of the railroad company, and should reinstate the brotherhood as such representative, until such time as these employees by a secret ballot taken in accordance with the further direction of the court, and without the dictation or interference of the railroad company and its officers, should choose other representatives. The order also required the restoration to service and to stated privileges of certain employees who had been discharged by the railroad company. 24 F.(2d) 426. Punishment was prescribed in case the defendants did not purge themselves of contempt as directed.\n On final hearing, the temporary injunction was made permanent. 25 F.( 2d) 873. At the same time, a motion to vacate the order in the contempt proceedings was denied. 25 F.(2d) 876. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree, holding that the injunction was properly granted and that, in imposing conditions for the purging of the defendants of contempt, the District Court had not gone beyond the appropriate exercise of its authority in providing for the restoration of the status quo. 33 F.(2d) 13. This court granted a writ of certiorari, \n280 \nU.S. 550\n, 50 S. Ct. 88, 74 L. Ed. -.\n The bill of complaint invoked subdivision third of section 2 of the Railway Labor Act of 1926 (c. 347, 44 Stat. 577 (45 USCA  152 subd. Third )), which provides as follows:\n'Third. Representatives, for the purposes of this Act, shall be designated by the respective parties in such man- \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 558]\n\u00a0\n ner as may be provided in their corporate organization or unincorporated association, or by other means of collective action, without interference, infiuence, or coercion exercised by either party over the self-organization or designation of representatives by the other.'\n\n The controversy is with respect to the construction, validity, and application of this statutory provision. The petitioners, the railroad company and its officers, contend that the provision confers merely an abstract right which was not intended to be enforced by legal proceedings; that, in so far as the statute undertakes to prevent either party from influencing the other in the selection of representatives, it is unconstitutional because it seeks to take away an inherent and inalienable right in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments of the Federal Constitution; that the granting of the injunction was prohibited by section 20 of the Clayton Act (U. S. C., Tit. 29,  52 (29 USCA  52)); that in any event the action taken by the railroad company and its officers in the recognition of the Association of Clerical Employees, and in other proceedings following upon that recognition, was not contrary to law and that there was no warrant for the interposition of the court either in granting the injunction order or in the proceedings for punishment for the alleged contempt.\n On the questions of fact, both courts below decided against the petitioners. Under the well-established rule, this court accepts the findings in which two courts concur, unless clear error is shown, Stuart v. Hayden, \n169 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 18 S. Ct. 274; Texas & Pacific Railway Company v. Railroad Commission, \n232 \nU.S. 338\n, 34 S. Ct. 438; Washington Securities Company v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 76, 78\n, 34 S. Ct. 725; Bodkin v. Edwards, \n255 \nU.S. 221, 223\n, 41 S. Ct. 268. We cannot say that there was such error in this case. Both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals approached the consideration of the evidence as to intimidation and coercion, and re- \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 559]\n\u00a0\n solved such conflicts as the evidence presented, in the light of the demonstration that a strong motive existed on the part of the railroad company to oppose the demands of the brotherhood and to promote another organization of the clerical employees which would be more favorable to the interests and contentions of the company. Both courts found the explanation of the company's attitude in the leter addressed by H. M. Lull, executive vice president of the railroad company, to A. D. McDonald, its president, under date of May 24, 1927, shortly before the activities of which complaint was made in this suit. In this letter Mr. Lull referred to the pendency before the United States Board of Mediation of the demand of the brotherhood for an increase of wages for the clerical employees, and it was stated that if the matter went to arbitration, and the award was made on the same basis as one which had recently been made with respect to the lines west of El Paso, it would mean an increased pay-roll cost of approximately $340,000 per annum. Mr. Lull said that from the best information obtainable the majority of the clerical and station service employees of the railroad company did not belong to the national organization (the brotherhood), and that 'it is our intention, when handling the matter in mediation proceedings, to raise the question of the right of this organization to represent these employees and if arbitration is proposed we shall decline to arbitrate on the basis that the petitioner does not represent the majority of the employees. This will permit us to get away from the interference of this organization, and if successful in this, I am satisfied we can make settlement with our own employees at a cost not to exceed $75,000 per annum.'\n Motive is a persuasive interpreter of equivocal conduct, and the petitioners are not entitled to complain because their activities were viewed in the light of manifest interest and purpose. The most that can be said in favor \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 560]\n\u00a0\n of the petitioners on the question of fact is that the evidence permits conflicting inferences, and this is not enough. The circumstances of the soliciting of authorizations and memberships on behalf of the association, the fact that employee of the railroad company who were active in promoting the development of the association were permitted to devote their time to that enterprise without deduction from their pay, the charge to the railroad company of expenses incurred in recruiting members of the association, the reports made to the railroad company of the progress of these efforts, and the discharge from the service of the railroad company of leading representatives of the brotherhood and the cancellation of their passes, gave support, despite the attempted justification of these proceedings, to the conclusion of the courts below that the railroad company and its officers were actually engaged in promoting the organization of the association in the interest of the company and in opposition to the brotherhood, and that these activities constituted an actual interference with the liberty of the clerical employees in the selection of their representatives. In this view, we decline to subject to minute scrutiny the language employed by these courts in discussing questions of fact (Page v. Rogers, \n211 \nU.S. 575, 577\n, 29 S. Ct. 159), and we pass to the important questions of law whether the statute imposed a legal duty upon the railroad company, that is, an obligation enforceable by judicial proceedings.\n It is unnecessary to review the history of the legislation enacted by Congress in relation to the settlement of railway labor disputes, as earlier efforts culminated in title 3 of the Transportation Act, 1920 (c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 469, 45 USCA  131-146), the purpose and effect of which have been determined by this court. In Pennsylvania Railroad Company v. United States Railroad Labor Board, \n261 \nU.S. 72\n, 43 S. Ct. 278, 281, the question was whether the members of the Railroad \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 561]\n\u00a0\n Labor Board as constituted under the provisions of the Transportation Act, 1920, had exceeded their powers. The court held that the board had jurisdiction to hear and decide a dispute over rules and working conditions upon the application of either side, when the parties had failed to agree and an adjustment board had not been organized. The board also had jurisdiction to decide who might represent the employees in the conferences contemplated by the statute and to make reasonable rules for ascertaining the will of the employees in this respect. Interference by injunction with the exercise of the discretion of the board in the matters committed to it, and with the publication of its opinions, was decided to be unwarranted. The court thought it evident that Congress considered it to be 'of the highest public interest to prevent the interruption of interstate commerce by labor disputes and strikes,' and that its plan was 'to encourage settlement without strikes, first by conference between the parties, failing that, by reference to adjustment boards of the parties' own choosing,' and, if this proved to be ineffective, 'by a full hearing before a national board' organized as the statute provided. But the court added: 'The decisions of the Labor Board are not to be enforced by process. The only sanction of its decision is to be the force of public opinion invoked by the fairness of a full hearing, the intrinsic justice of the conclusion, strengthened by the official prestige of the Board, and the full publication of the violation of such decision by any party to the proceeding.' It was said to be the evident thought of Congress 'that the economic interest of every member of the public in the undisturbed flow of interstate commerce and the acute inconvenience to which all must be subjected by an interruption caused by a serious and widespread labor dispute, fastens public attention closely on all the circumstances of the controversy and arouses public criticism of the side thought to be at \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 562]\n\u00a0\n fault.' Id., pages 79, 80 of 261 U. S., 43 S. Ct. 278, 281. The court concluded that the Labor Board was 'to act as a board of arbitration,' but that there was 'no constraint' upon the parties 'to do what the Board decides they should do except the moral constraint ... of publication of its decision.' Id., page 84 of 261 U. S., 43 S. Ct. 278, 283.\n The provisions of title III of the Transportation Act, 1920, were again before the court in Pennsylvania Railroad System & Allied Lines Federation No. 90 v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, \n267 \nU.S. 203\n, 45 S. Ct. 307. This was a suit by a union to enjoin the railroad company from carrying out an alleged conspiracy to defeat the provisions of the legislation establishing the Railroad Labor Board. The complainants, the court said, sought 'to enforce by mandatory injunction a compliance with a decision of the board,' and the court held that 'such a remedy by injunction in a court it was not the intention of Congress to provide.' Id ., page 216 of 267 U. S., 45 S. Ct. 307, 311. The court pointed out that 'the ultimate decision of the board, it is conceded, is not compulsory, and no process is furnished to enforce it.' It was in the light of these conclusions as to the purport of the statute that the court considered the freedom of action of the railroad company. The court said that the company was using 'every endeavor to avoid compliance with the judgment and principles of the Labor Board as to the proper method of securing representatives of the whole body of its employees,' that it was 'seeking to control its employees by agreements free from the influence of an independent trade union,' and, so far as concerned its dealings with its employees was 'refusing to comply with the decisions of the Labor Board.' But the court held that this conduct was within the strict legal rights of the railroad company and that Congress had not intended to make such conduct legally actionable. Id., page 217 of 267 U. S., 45 S. Ct. 307, 311.\n It was with clear appreciation of the infirmity of the existing legislation, and in the endeavor to establish a \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 563]\n\u00a0\n more practicable plan in order to accomplish the desired result, that Congress enacted the Railway Labor Act of 1926. It was decided to make a fresh start. The situation was thus described in the report of the bill to the Senate by the Committee on Interstate Commerce (69th Cong., 1st Sess., Sen. Rep. No. 222): 'In view of the fact that the employees absolutely refuse to appear before the labor board and that many of the important railroads are themselves opposed to it, that it has been held by the Supreme Court to have no power to enforce its judgments, that its authority is not recognized or respected by the employees and by a number of important railroads, that the President has suggested that it would be wise to seek a substitute for it, and that the party platforms of both the Republican and Democratic Parties in 1924 clearly indicated dissatisfaction with the provisions of the transportation act relating to labor, the committee concluded that the time had arrived when the labor board should be abolished and the provisions relating to labor in the transportation act, 1920, should be repealed.'\n The bill was introduced as the result of prolonged conferences between representative committees of railroad presidents and of executives of railroad labor organizations, and embodied an agreement of a large majority of both. 2 The provisions of title 3 of the Transportation Act, 1920 and also the Act of July 15, 1913 (c. 6, 38 Stat. \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 564]\n\u00a0\n 103, 45 USCA  101-125) which provided for mediation, conciliation, and arbitration in controversies with railway employees, were repealed.\n While adhering in the new statute to the policy of providing for the amicable adjustment of labor disputes, and for voluntary submissions to arbitration as opposed to a system of compulsory arbitration, Congress buttressed this policy by creating certain definite legal obligations. The outstanding feature of the Act of 1926 is the provision for an enforceable award in arbitration proceedings. The arbitration is voluntary, but the award pursuant to the arbitration is conclusive upon the parties as to the merits and facts of the controversy submitted. Section 9 (45 USCA  159). The award is to be filed in the clerk's office of the District Court of the United States designated in the agreement to arbitrate, and unless a petition to impeach the award is filed within ten days, the court is to enter judgment on the award, and this judgment is final and conclusive. Petition for the impeachment of the award may be made upon the grounds that the award does not conform to the substantive requirements of the act or to the stipulation of the parties, or that the proceedings were not in accordance with the act or were tainted with fraud or corruption. But the court is not to entertain such a petition on the ground that the award is invalid for uncer- \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 565]\n\u00a0\n tainty, and in such case the remedy is to be found in a submission of the award to a reconvened board or to a subcommittee thereof for interpretation, as provided in the act. Thus it is contemplated that the proceedings for the amicable adjustment of disputes will have an appropriate termination in a binding adjudication, enforceable as such.\n Another definite object of the Act of 1926 is to provide, in case of a dispute between a carrier and its employees which has not been adjusted under the provisions of the act, for the more effectual protection of interstate commerce from interruption to such a degree as to deprive any section of the country of essential transportation service. Section 10 (45 USCA  160). In case the Board of Mediation established by the act, as an independent agency in the executive branch of the government, finds that such an interruption of interstate commerce is threatened, that board is to notify the President, who may thereupon in his discretion create an emergency board of investigation to report, within thirty days, with respect to the dispute. The act then provides that: 'After the creation of such board and for thirty days after such board has made its report to the President, no change, except by agreement, shall be made by the parties to the controversy in the conditions out of which the dispute arose.' Id. This prohibition, in order to safeguard the vital interests of the country while an investigation is in progress, manifestly imports a legal obligation. The brotherhood insists, and we think rightly, that the major purpose of Congress in passing the Railway Labor Act was 'to provide a machinery to prevent strikes.' Section 10 is described by counsel for the brotherhood as 'a provision limiting the right to strike,' and in this view it is insisted that there 'is no possible question that Congress intended to make the provisions of section 10 enforceable to the extent of authorizing any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 566]\n\u00a0\n either party to the controversy from changing the existing status during the sixty-day period provided for the emergency board.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The provision of section 10 is to be read in connection with the qualification in subdivision eighth of section 9 that nothing in the act shall be construed to require an individual employee to render labor without his consent or as making the quitting of service by an individual employee an illegal act, and that no court shall issue any process to compel the performance by an individual employee of labor without his consent. The purpose of this \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 567]\n\u00a0\n limitation was manifestly to protect the individual liberty of employees and not to affect proceedings in case of combinations or group action. The denial of legal process in the one case is significant with respect to its expected, appropriate use in the other. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n It is thus apparent that Congress, in the legislation of 1926, while elaborating a plan for amicable adjustments and voluntary arbitration of disputes between common carriers and their employees, thought it necessary to impose, and did impose, certain definite obligations enforceable by judicial proceedings. The question before us is whether a legal obligation of this sort is also to be found in the provisions of subdivision third of section 2 of the act (45 USCA  152, subd. Third) providing that, 'Representatives, for the purposes of this Act, shall be designated by the respective parties ... without interference, influence, or coercion exercised by either party over the self-organization or designation of representatives by the other.'\n It is at once to be observed that Congress was not content with the general declaration of the duty of carriers and employees to make every reasonable effort to enter into and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 568]\n\u00a0\n rules and working conditions, and to settle disputes with all expedition in conference between authorized representatives, but added this distinct prohibition against coercive measures. This addition cannot be treated as superfluous or insignificant, or as intended to be without effect. Ex parte Public National Bank, \n278 \nU.S. 101, 104\n, 49 S. Ct. 43. While an affirmative declaration of duty contained in a legislative enactment may be of imperfect obligation because not enforceable in terms, a definite statutory prohibition of conduct which would thwart the declared purpose of the legislation cannot be disregarded. The intent of Congress is clear with respect to the sort of conduct that is prohibited. 'Interference' with freedom of action and 'coercion' refer to well- understood concepts of the law. The meaning of the word 'influence' in this clause may be gathered from the context. Noscitur a sociis. Virginia v. Tennessee, \n148 \nU.S. 503, 519\n, 13 S. Ct. 728. The use of the word is not to be taken as interdicting the normal relations and innocent communications which are a part of all friendly intercourse, albeit between employer and employee. 'Influence' in this context plainly means pressure, the use of the authority or power of either party to induce action by the other in derogation of what the statute calls 'self- organization.' The phrase covers the abuse of relation or opportunity so as to corrupt or override the will, and it is no more difficult to appraise conduct of this sort in connection with the selection of representatives for the purposes of this act than in relation to well- known applications of the law with respect to fraud, duress, and undue influence. If Congress intended that the prohibition, as thus construed, should be enforced, the courts would encounter no difficulty in fulfilling its purpose, as the present suit demonstrates.\n In reaching a conclusion as to the intent of Congress, the importance of the prohibition in its relation to the plan devised by the act must have appropriate considera- \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 569]\n\u00a0\n tion. Freedom of choice in the selection of representatives on each side of the dispute is the essential foundation of the statutory scheme. All the proceedings looking to amicable adjustments and to agreements for arbitration of disputes, the entire policy of the act, must depend for success on the uncoerced action of each party through its own representatives to the end that agreements satisfactory to both may be reached and the peace essential to the uninterrupted service of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce may be maintained. There is no impairment of the voluntary character of arrangements for the adjustment of disputes in the imposition of a legal obligation not to interfere with the free choice of those who are to make such adjustments. On the contrary, it is of the essence of a voluntary scheme, if it is to accomplish its purpose, that this liberty should be safeguarded. The definite prohibition which Congress inserted in the act can not therefore be overridden in the view that Congress intended it to be ignored. As the prohibition was appropriate to the aim of Congress, and is capable of enforcement, the conclusion must be that enforcement was contemplated.\n The absence of penalty is not controlling. The creation of a legal right by language suitable to that end does not require for its effectiveness the imposition of statutory penalties. Many rights are enforced for which no statutory penalties are provided. In the case of the statute in question, there is an absence of penalty, in the sense of specially prescribed punishment, with respect to the arbitral awards and the prohibition of change in conditions pending the investigation and report of an emergency board, but in each instance a legal obligation is created and the statutory requirements are susceptible of enforcement by proceedings appropriate to each. The same is true of the prohibition of interference or coercion in connection with the choice of representatives. The \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 570]\n\u00a0\n right is created and the remedy exists. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, 137, 162, 163.\n We entertain no doubt of the constitutional authority of Congress to enact the prohibition. The power to regulate commerce is the power to enact 'all appropriate legislation' for its 'protection or advancement' ( The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 564); to adopt measures 'to promote its growth and insure its safety' (County of Mobile v. Kimball, \n102 \nU.S. 691, 696\n, 697 S.); to 'foster, protect, control and restrain' (Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 47\n, 32 S. Ct. 169, 174, 38 L. R. A. (M. S.) 44). Exercising this authority, Congress may facilitate the amicable settlements of disputes which threaten the service of the necessary agencies of interstate transportation. In shaping its legislation to this end, Congress was entitled to take cognizance of actual conditions and to address itself to practicable measures. The legality of collective action on the part of employees in order to safeguard their proper interests is not to be disputed. It has long been recognized that employees are entitled to organize for the purpose of securing the redress of grievances and to promote agreements with employers relating to rates of pay and conditions of work. American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trade Council, \n257 \nU.S. 184, 209\n, 42 S. Ct. 72, 27 A. L. R. 360. Congress was not required to ignore this right of the employees but could safeguard it and seek to make their appropriate collective action an instrument of peace rather than of strife. Such collective action would be a mockery if representation were made futile by interferences with freedom of choice. Thus the prohibition by Congress of interference with the selection of representatives for the purpose of negotiation and conference between employers and employees, instead of being an invasion of the constitutional right of either, was based on the recognition of the rights of both. The petitioners invoke the principle declared in Adair v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 161\n, 28 S. Ct. 277, 13 Ann. Cas. 764, and Coppage v. Kansas, \n236 \nU.S. 1\n, 35 S. Ct. 240, L. R. A. 1915C, 960, \n\n[281 U.S. 548, 571]\n\u00a0\n but these decisions are inapplicable. The Railway Labor Act of 1926 does not interfere with the normal exercise of the right of the carrier to select its employees or to discharge them. The statute is not aimed at this right of the employers but at the interference with the right of employees to have representatives of their own choosing. As the carriers subject to the act have no constitutional right to interfere with the freedom of the employees in making their selections, they cannot complain of the statute on constitutional grounds.\n A subordinate point is raised by the petitioner under section 20 of the Clayton Act (29 USCA  52). This section provides, in substance, that no injunction shall be granted in any case growing out of a dispute concerning terms or conditions of employment, unless necessary to prevent irreparable injury to property or to a property right. This provision has been said to be declaratory of the existing law. Duplex Printing Press Company v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 470\n, 41 S. Ct. 172, 16 A. L. R. 196. It may be doubted whether section 20 can be regarded as limiting the authority of the court to restrain the violation of an explicit provision of an act of Congress, where an injunction would otherwise be the proper remedy. It is not necessary to pass upon this point, for if it could be said that it was necessary in the present instance to show a property interest in the employees in order to justify the court in granting an injunction, we are of the opinion that there was such an interest, with respect to the selection of representatives to confer with the employer in relation to contracts of service, as satisfied the statutory requirement. See Coppage v. Kansas, supra, pages 14, 15 of 236 U. S., 35 S.

R. Rep. No. 328):\n'The bill was introduced as the product of negotiations and conferences between a representative committee of railroad presidents and a representative committee of railroad labor organization executives, extending over several months, which were concluded with the approval of the bill, respectively, by the Association of Railway Executives and by the executives of 20 railroad labor organizations. As introduced, it represented the agreement of railway managements operating over 80 per cent. of the railroad mileage and labor organizations representing an overwhelming majority of the railroad employees.'\n\n The Committee of the Senate on Interstate Commerce reported to the Senate on this point, as follows (69th Cong., 1st sess., Sen. Rep. No. 222):\n'The railroads favoring the bill appeared before the committee through their representatives and advocated it. None of the railroads opposing the bill appeared either in person or by any representative. The bill was agreed to also by all the organizations known as 'standard recognized railway labor organizations', 20 in number, and these appeared by their representatives before the committee in advocacy of the bill.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In the report to the House of Representatives by its Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, it was stated as to this provision (69th Cong., 1st sess., H. R. Rep. No. 328):\n'This temporary emergency board will be able to express and to mobilize public opinion to an extent impossible to any permanent board or any agency of Government which has been heretofore created for that purpose. It is also highly important to point out that during the period of investigation and for 30 days thereafter the parties to the controversy are bound under the proposed law to maintain unchanged the conditions out of which the dispute arose, thereby assuring the parties and the public that the emergency board will have the full and unembarrassed opportunity to exert its authority and fulfill its important function.'\n\n The Committee on Interstate Commerce of the Senate stated in its report, with respect to a proposed amendment of section 10 forbidding strikes eo nominee, as follows (69th Cong., 1st sess., Sen. Rep. No. 222):\n'The objection that the bill should in express terms forbid strikes during the period of the inquiry by the emergency board and for 30 days thereafter is successfully met, in the opinion of the committee, by the contention that in forbidding a change in the conditions out of which a dispute arose, one of which and a very fundamental one is the relationship of the parties, it already forbids any interruption of commerce during the period referred to; and if strikes were in express terms forbidden for a given period there might be an implication that after that period strikes to interfere with the passage of the United States mails and with continuous transportation service might be made be made legal. In the opinion of the committee, this possible implication should be avoided.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In relation to this paragraph, the Senate Committee stated in its report (69th Cong., 1st sess., Sen. Rep. No. 222):\n'As to paragraph (8) of section 9, it was urged that it should be clarified so as certainly to apply only to the use of legal process against an individual employee and so as not to apply to combinations or conspiracies between several employees or groups of employees to interrupt interstate commerce. It was frankly stated by the advocates of the bill, both those representing the carriers and those representing the employees, that the purpose of the paragraph was to deal marely with individual employees, to express only the constitutional right of individuals against involuntary servitude, and was not intended to deal with combinations, conspiracies, or group action. This construction has been made abundantly clear by an amendment to the bill by which the word 'individual' has been inserted before the 'employee' wherever the latter word appears in the paragraph.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","123":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTODOK v. UNION STATE BANK(1930)\nNo. 412\nArgued: April 22, 1930Decided: May 19, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 449, 450]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank E. Edgerton, of Aurora, Neb., and Norris Brown, of Omaha, Neb., for petitioners.\n Mr. Walter D. James, of Cambridge, Neb., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Christian Knudson, a native and citizen of Norway, came to this county in 1868 and settled in Nebraska in 1878. He was never naturalized. He established a homestead on 160 acres of land in Hamilton county, Neb., and resided there until he died intestate in August, 1923. His father and mother made their home with him until their death, and his son Knute C. Engen, who came to Enbraska in 1893, also lived with him for time. The wife of Knudson remained in Norway. In July, 1923, Knudson executed deeds of the homestead to his nieces \n\n[281 U.S. 449, 451]\n\u00a0\n and their husbands, and these grantees conveyed the property to the Union State Bank of Harvard, Neb.\n The suit was brought by the son of Knudson, Knute C. Engen, in the district court of Hamilton county to cancel the conveyances of the land upon the ground that they were obtained by fraud. The widow of Knudson, Mari Tollefsen Todok, who had not joined in the deeds, was made a defendant. By her cross-petition she attacked the conveyances, alleging that the property constituted a homestead in which she had an undivided one-half interest. The other defendants answered her cross-petition, and in her reply she set up the right to take the real estate of her deceased husband by virtue of the treaty of amity and commerce between the United States and Norway.\n The District Court determined that no fraud had been practiced in obtaining the deeds from Knudson, but that these, and the later conveyances dependent upon them, were void upon the ground that the land was homestead property the title to which remained in Knudson until his death and then descended to his widow and his son. The Supreme Court of the state sustained the decision of the district court with respect to the issue of fraud, but reversed the judgment upon the ground that, under the treaty with Norway, Knudson was entitled to convey the property and that his grantees took title under his deeds. Engen v. Union State Bank, 223 N. W. 664. This court granted a writ of certiorari, \n280 \nU.S. 546\n, 50 S. Ct. 40, 74 L. Ed. -.\n We are not called upon to decide as to the validity under the homestead law of Nebraska of a deed of the homestead by the husband when the wife is an alien who has never come to this country and made the homestead her home. We accept the decision of the Supreme Court of the state that, aside from the effect of the treaty, Knudson's conveyances were void under the law of the state. That court, referring to the statutes of Nebraska \n\n[281 U.S. 449, 452]\n\u00a0\n as to homestead property, and their application to the present case, said ( 223 N. W. page 667):\n'For, if we consider the provisions of section 2819 and section 2832, Comp. St. 1922, as applicable to the subject of the present action, it necessarily follows that certain property within the purview of the treaty before us 'cannot be conveyed ... unless the instrument by which it is conveyed ... is executed and acknowledged by both husband and wife,' and also that such property (homestead) 'vests on the death of the person from whose property it was selected, in the survivor, for life, and afterwards in decedent's heirs forever, subject to the power of the decedent to dispose of the same, except the life estate of the survivor, by will.'\n\n'The statutory provisions referred to thus assume the nature of limitations, qualifications, or modifications of the treaty itself, and, if valid, would necessarily change its true construction. Each of these provisions of the legislative enactment must therefore be considered to be pro tanto inconsistent with the terms of the controlling treaty properly construed. The conclusion follows that, to the extent inconsistent with the terms of the treaty, the statutory provisions are inoperative. The unquestioned rule of construction requires that the provisions of the treaty must be liberally construed and given full force and effect 'anything in the Constitution or laws of any state to the contrary, notwithstanding.' Therefore, the legal effect of the conveyances executed by Christian Knudson must be determined wholly by the powers conferred on him by treaty, and not by the inconsistent limitations and restrictions prescribed in the Nebraska Homestead Act.'\n\n The only question before us is as to the construction of the treaty. The provision invoked is article 6 of the treaty with Sweden of April 3, 1783 (8 Stat. 6064), revived by the treaty with Sweden and Norway of Sept. \n\n[281 U.S. 449, 453]\n\u00a0\n 4, 1816 (8 Stat. 232, 240) which was replaced by the treaty with Sweden and Norway of July 4, 1827 (8 Stat. 346, 354) now in force with Norway ( Sen. Doc., 61st Cong., 2d Sess., No. 357, vol. 48 (2 Malloy), p. 1300). This article is as follows:\n'The subjects of the contracting parties in the respective states, may freely dispose of their goods and effects either by testament, donation or otherwise, in favor of such persons as they think proper; and their heirs in whatever place they shall reside, shall receive the succession even ab intestato, either in person or by their attorney, without having occasion to take out letters of naturalization. These inheritances, as well as the capitals and effects, which the subjects of the two parties, in changing their dwelling, shall be desirous of removing from the place of their abode, shall be exempted from all duty called 'droit de detraction,' on the part of the government of the two states respectively. But it is at the same time agreed, that nothing contained in this article shall in any manner derogate from the ordinances published in Sweden against emigrations, or which may hereafter be published, which shall remain in full force and vigour. The United States on their part, or any of them, shall be at liberty to make respecting this matter, such laws as they think proper.'\n\n It was at one time supposed that the phrase 'goods and effects' in this article did not cover real property, a construction which was due in some measure to the view that the treaties of the United States could not affect the operation of the laws of the several States of the Union with respect to the inheritance of land. Opinion of Attorney General Wirt, July 30, 1819, 1 Ops. Attys. Gen. 275. This view of the treaty-making power of the United States is not tenable. Hauenstein v. Lynham, \n100 U.S. 483\n, 489; Geofroy v. Riggs, \n133 \nU.S. 258, 266\n, 267 S., 10 S. Ct. 295; Sullivan v. Kidd, \n254 \nU.S. 433\n, 41 S. Ct. 158; Nielsen v. Johnson, \n279 \nU.S. 47\n, 49 S. Ct. 223. \n\n[281 U.S. 449, 454]\n\u00a0\n The text of the treaty of 1783 with Sweden was in French only, and the French text is therefore controlling. The phrase 'goods and effects' is a translation of the French expression 'fonds et biens.' The French word 'biens' has a wider significance than the English word 'goods' (used by the American translator) and embraces real property. Story observed upon this point: 'The term 'biens', in the sense of the civilians and continental jurists, comprehends not merely goods and chattels as in the common law, but real estate.' Conflict of Laws, c. 1,  13, note. In a note addressed by the Swedish Minister at Washington to the Department of State under date of December 12, 1910, in response to an inquiry by the Secretary of State of the United States, the Swedish Minister stated his understanding that the authorities in Sweden had always held that the words 'goods and effects' in article 6 of the treaty of 1783 include real estate. This view has been taken in judicial decisions in this country. Adams v. Akerlund, 168 Ill. 632, 48 N. E. 454; Erickson v. Carlson, 95 Neb. 182, 145 N. W. 352. We think that it is the correct construction of the article of the treaty, applying the fundamental principle that treaties should receive a liberal interpretation to give effect to their apparent purpose. Geofroy v. Riggs, supra; Tucker v. Alexandroff, \n183 \nU.S. 424, 437\n, 22 S. Ct. 195; Jordan v. Tashiro, \n278 \nU.S. 123, 128\n, 49 S. Ct. 47; Nielsen v. Johnson, supra.\n The question remains whether the treaty operates to override the law of the state as to the disposition of homestead property. If so, it would appear to place an alien owner of a homestead in Nebraska on a better footing than that of a citizen of the state. This conclusion seems to us to be repugnant to the purpose of the treaty. While treaties, in safeguarding important rights in the interest of reciprocal beneficial relations, may by their express terms afford a measure of protection to aliens which citizens of one or both of the parties may not be \n\n[281 U.S. 449, 455]\n\u00a0\n able to demand against their own government, the general purpose of treaties of amity and commerce is to avoid injurious discrimination in either country against the citizens of the other. Compare Frederickson v. Louisiana, 23 How. 445, 447; Geofroy v. Riggs, supra; Maiorano v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 268\n, 29 S. Ct. 424; Patsone v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 138\n, 34 S. Ct. 281; Petersen v. Iowa, \n245 \nU.S. 170\n, 38 S. Ct. 109; Duus v. Brown, \n245 \nU.S. 176\n, 38 S. Ct. 111; Sullivan v. Kidd, supra. This purpose is indicated in the recital of the treaty of 1783 with Sweden that the high contracting parties thought that they could not better accomplish the end they had in view 'than by taking for a basis of their arrangements the mutual interest and advantage of both nations, thereby avoiding all those burthensome preferences, which are usually sources of debate, embarrassment and discontent.'\n It is not to be supposed that the treaty intended to secure the right of disposition in any manner whatever regardless of reasonable regulations in accordance with the property law of the country of location, bearing upon aliens and citizens alike. For example, conveyances of land would still be subject to nondiscriminatory provisions as to form or recording. Nor can the right to 'dispose,' secured by the treaty, be deemed to give a wholly unrestricted right to the alien to acquire property, without regard to reasonable requirements relating to particular kinds of property and imposed upon both aliens and citizens without discrimination.\n It is true that the policy of Nebraska with respect to the selection of homesteads was established after the treaty in question was made. General Laws, Nebraska, 1879, p. 57, et seq. But we find no ground for the conclusion that in establishing this reasonable policy Nebraska took any action which was inconsistent with the provisions of the treaty. The citizens kof Norway and Sweden who settled in Nebraska had no reason to com- \n\n[281 U.S. 449, 456]\n\u00a0\n plain of that policy, and had obtained no right to ignore it. The homestead property under the law of Nebraska has a special quality. It is exempt from judgment liens and from executions or forced sale, except as specially provided. Nebraska Comp. St. 1922,  2816. The acquisition of the homestead with these incidents depends upon the bona fide intention to make it a home. Hair v. Davenport, 74 Neb. 117, 103 N. W. 1042. It is because of this quality that it enjoys special privileges, and that it cannot be conveyed or incumbered unless the instrument is executed and acknowledged by both husband and wife.\n When Knudson selected the homestead, he sought the advantages of the provisions of the local law as to homesteads, and he could not properly obtain the benefits of these provisions without accepting the property with the quality which the law attached to it. If he had not been entitled to establish the homestead, and thus his acquisition lay outside of the homestead law, it would be clear that the statutory provision against disposition of the homestead would have no application and there would have been no occasion for the Supreme Court of the state to cite the provisions of the treaty in order to strike down the prohibition against conveying the property. We are unable to see that anything in the treaty, which was continued in force with Norway, gave Knudson the right to establish a homestead and then hold it free from the restrictions which governed it as a homestead, restrictions which operated upon every citizen of Nebraska who owned a homestead.\n Our conclusion is that the treaty did not invalidate the provisions of the Nebraska statute as applied to the present case in relation to the disposition of the land considered as homestead property.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTOOMBS v.

E. 645. Section 1 of Art. 6 Georgia Banking Law, Act of August 26th, Ga. Laws, 1925, p. 126, amending Art. 6, Ga. Laws, 1919, pp. 135, 152; Ga. Civil Code 1926,  2366(48), 2366(49).\n Section 1 (printed in the margin1) provides that, when the capital of a state bank is impaired, the superintendent \n\n[281 U.S. 643, 645]\n\u00a0\n shall require the bank to make good the impairment by assessment upon the stockholders, and that 'it shall be the duty of the officers and directors of the bank receiving such notice to immediately call a special meeting of the stockholders for the purpose of making an assessment upon its stockholders sufficient to cover the impairment.' Section 2 authorizes the bank, in addition to other remedies, to bring suit against stockholders for the amount of the assessment. The Supreme Court of the state, construing the statute, has held that an assessment under the provisions of section 1 (formerly in section 2 of article 6 of the Georgia Banking Law, Ga. Laws 1919, p. 135) is a voluntary act on the part of the stockholders, who may, at their election, by action taken at the stockholders meeting, levy the assessment, or decline to levy it and permit the liquidation of the bank of the superintendent of banks, who may levy an assessment under another provision of the statute not now involved. Smith v. Mobley, 166 Ga. 195, 143 S. E. 116. Articles 6 and 7 of the Georgia Banking Law, Ga. Laws, 1919, p. 135.\n Petitioner is the owner of shares of capital stock of the Citizens' Bank of Waynesboro, chartered under the Georgia statutes January 1, 1920. On August 16, 1926, the bank became insolvent and passed into the control of the state superintendent of banks, who found that the \n\n[281 U.S. 643, 646]\n\u00a0\n net indebtedness of the bank exceeded its capital. Certain depositors of the bank having undertaken to release their claims so that its indebtedness would equal its capital, the superintendent of banks agreed to surrender his control of the bank if its stockholders would authorize a levy of an assessment of 100 per cent. of the par value of the stock. A stockholders meeting, held October 22, 1926, at which a majority of the shares was represented, adopted resolutions assessing the stock accordingly.\n The present suit to recover the assessment upon appellant's shares was brought in the superior court of Wilkes county, and its judgment in favor of the respondent was affirmed by the state Supreme Court. Appellant, by his pleadings, challenged the constitutionality of the statute upon the ground, relied on here, that section 1, by its failure to provide for notice to stockholders of the special meeting for the purpose of levying the assessment, denies due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Petitioner thus seeks to raise the question whether one who acquires stock in a corporation, notice of whose meetings is dispensed with by state law, can, for that reason alone, invoke the due process clause to set aside corporate action adversely affecting his interest as a stockholder.\n But no such question is presented. Section 1 makes it the duty of the officers and directors of the bank, in the contingencies named, to 'call a special meeting of the stockholders for the purpose of making an assessment.' The statute does not prescribe that the meeting be called without notice. Petitioner points to no provision of the Georgia statutes or of the charter or by-laws of the bank dispensing with notice, nor to any decision of the Supreme Court holding that the statutory duty to 'call' a stockholders meeting can be performed without reasonable notice to stockholders of the time and place of meeting. Even when there is no provision, in statute or by-laws, for notice, it has been held that common- law principles re- \n\n[281 U.S. 643, 647]\n\u00a0\n quire corporate meetings to be called by reasonable notice to stockholders. See Stow v. Wyse, 7 Conn. 214, 18 Am. Dec. 99; Wiggin v. First Freewill Baptist Church, 8 Metc. (Mass.) 301, 312; Stevens v. Eden Meeting-House Society, 12 Vt. 688, 689. That, we think, in the absence of a controlling decision of the highest court of Georgia, must be taken to be the implied requirement of section 1.\n Notice was in fact given in the present case, as appears by the agreed statement of facts, by mailing it fifteen days before the meeting, addressed to petitioner at his address last known to the bank. It does not appear whether he received the notice. In the face of this record, we cannot assume either that notice was not required by the law of the state or that that actually given was insufficient.\n In assailing the constitutionality of a state statute, the burden rests upon appellant to establish that it infringes the constitutional guarantee which he invokes. If the state court has not otherwise construed it, and it is susceptible of an interpretation which conforms to constitutional requirements, doubts must be resolved in favor of, and not against, the state.

At the time of his death, he and his wife owned, as tenants by the entirety, shares of stock in a West Virginia corporation doing business in Maryland. The decedent had been the sole owner of the stock and created the tenancy by a conveyance executed in 1917. The stock was included in the gross estate of the decedent at its value at the time of his death. The total tax assessed was paid, and the administrators brought suit to recover the portion of the amount so paid attributable to the stock, together with interest. The trial court gave judgment against the government, 28 F.(2d) 887, which was reversed by the Court of Appeals. 33 F.(2d) 724.\n In No. 546, which arose under the act of 1921, the decedent and his wife, residents of Pennsylvania, held title to certain ground rent and to certain real estate in that state which had been conveyed to them as tenants by the entirety. The property had been acquired with the husband's separate funds, and no part of the purchase price was furnished by the wife. The decedent died in 1923, leaving his wife as sole beneficiary under his will. The administrators filed an estate tax return which did not include the property interests above described. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue added this property to the gross estate and assessed a deficiency of taxes on that account. The Board of Tax Appeals held there was no deficiency. Appeal of Provident Trust Co., 5 B. T. A. 1004. Suit thereupon was instituted by the Commissioner in a federal District Court. That court held that the section of the act which author- \n\n[281 U.S. 497, 500]\n\u00a0\n ized the inclusion of the property was unconstitutional, and gave judgment against the government. This judgment the Court of Appeals affirmed. United States v. Provident Trust Co. of Pennsylvania, 35 F.

In 1923 the property was conveyed to a third person, who, in turn, reconveyed it to the decedent and her husband as 'tenants by the entireties.' After the death of the decedent, the Commissioner, for the purpose of computing the estate tax, included in her gross estate the value of the real estate so held. On appeal, the Board of Tax Appeals held this inclusion to be erroneous. Girard Trust Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 10 B. T. A. 1100. The Commissioner filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals, and that court affirmed the action of the Board upon the authority of No. 546, which had just been decided.

That the value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated : ...\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 497, 501]\n\u00a0\n '(c) To the extent of the interest therein held jointly or as tenants in (by) the entirety by the decedent and any other person, or deposited in banks or other institutions in their joint names and payable to either or the survivor, except such part thereof as may be shown to have originally belonged to such other person and never to have belonged to the decedent.'\n The applicable provision of section 202(c) is explicit, and the intent of Congress thereby to impose the challenged tax is not open to doubt. The sole question is in respect of its constitutional validity. The attack is upon two grounds: (1) That, so far as the tax is based upon the inclusion of the value of the interest in the estate held by the decedent and spouse as tenants by the entirety, it is an unapportioned direct tax and violates article 1,  2, cl. 3, and section 9, cl. 4, of the Constitution; (2) that such a tax amounts to a deprivation of property without due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n The decisions of the courts of Maryland and Pennsylvania follow the common law, and are in accord in respect of the character and incidents of tenancy by the entirety. In legal contemplation, the tenants constitute a unit; neither can dispose of any part of the estate without the consent of the other; and the whole continues in the survivor. In Maryland, such a tenancy may exist in personal property as well as in real estate. These decisions establish a state rule of property, by which, of course, this court is bound. Warburton v. White, \n176 \nU.S. 484, 496\n, 20 S. Ct. 404.\n\n 1. \nThe contention that, by including in the gross estate the value of property held by husband and wife as tenants by the entirety, the tax pro tanto becomes a direct tax-that is, a tax on property-and therefore invalid without apportionment, proceeds upon the ground \n\n[281 U.S. 497, 502]\n\u00a0\n that no right in such property is transferred by death, but the survivor retains only what he already had. Section 201 imposes the tax 'upon the transfer of the net estate'; and if that section stood alone, the inclusion of such property in the gross estate of the decedent probably could not be justified by the terms of the statute. But section 202 definitely includes the property and brings it within the reach of the words imposing the tax; so that a basis for the constitutional challenge is present. Prior decisions of this court do not solve the problem thus presented, though what was said in Chase National Bank v. United States, \n278 U.S. 327\n, 337-339, 49 S. Ct. 126, 63 A. L. R. 388, Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339, 348\n, 49 S. Ct. 339, and Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260, 271\n, 48 S. Ct. 225, constitutes helpful aid in that direction.\n Death duties rest upon the principle that death is the 'generating source' from which the authority to impose such taxes takes its being and 'it is the power to transmit or the transmission or receipt of property by death which is the subject levied upon by all death duties.' Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 56\n, 57 S., 20 S. Ct. 747, 754. But mere names and definitions, however important as aids to understanding, do not conclude the lawmaker, who is free to ignore them and adopt his own. Karnuth v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 231, 242\n, 49 S. Ct. 274. A tax laid upon the happening of an event, as distinguished from its tangible fruits, is an indirect tax which Congress, in respect of some events not necessary now to be described more definitely, undoubtedly may impose. If the event is death and the result which is made the occasion of the tax is the bringing into being or the enlargement of property rights, and Congress chooses to treat the tax imposed upon that result as a death duty, even though, strictly, in the absence of an expression of the legislative will, it might not thus be denominated, there is nothing in the Constitution which stands in the way. \n\n[281 U.S. 497, 503]\n\u00a0\n The question here, them, is, not whether there has been, in the strict sense of that word, a 'transfer' of the property by the death of the decedent, or a receipt of it by right of succession, but whether the death has brought into being or ripened for the survivor, property rights of such character as to make appropriate the imposition of a tax upon that result (which Congress may call a transfer tax, a death duty or anything else it sees fit), to be measured, in whole or in part, by the value of such rights.\n According to the amiable fiction of the common law, adhered to in Pennsylvania and Maryland, husband and wife are but one person, and the point made is that, by the death of one party to this unit, no interest in property held by them as tenants by the entirety passes to the other. This view, when applied to a taxing act, seems quite unsubstantial. The power of taxation is a fundamental and imperious necessity of all government, not to be restricted by mere legal fictions. Whether that power has been properly exercised in the present instance must be determined by the actual results brought about by the death, rather than by a consideration of the artificial rules which delimit the title, rights, and powers of tenants by the entirety at common law. See Nicol v. Ames, \n173 \nU.S. 509, 516\n, 19 S. Ct. 522; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, supra, page 271 of 276 U. S., 48 S. Ct. 225.\n Taxation, as it many times has been said, is eminently practical, and a practical mind, considering results, would have some difficulty in accepting the conclusion that the death of one of the tenants in each of these cases did not have the effect of passing to the survivor substantial rights, in respect of the property, theretofore never enjoyed by such survivor. Before the death of the husband (to take the Tyler Case, No. 428) the wife had the right to possess and use the whole property, but so also had her husband; she could not dispose of the property \n\n[281 U.S. 497, 504]\n\u00a0\n except with her husband's concurrence; her rights were hedged about at all points by the equal rights of her husband. At his death, however, and because of it, she, for the first time, became entitled to exclusive possession, use and enjoyment; she ceased to hold the property subject to qualifications imposed by the law relating to tenancy by the entirety, and became entitled to hold and enjoy it absolutely as her own; and then, and then only, she acquired the power, not therefore possessed, of disposing of the property by an exercise of her sole will. Thus the death of one of the parties to the tenancy became the 'generating source' of important and definite accessions to the property rights of the other. These circumstances, together with the fact, the existence of which the statute requires, that no part of the property originally had belonged to the wife, are sufficient, in our opinion, to make valid the inclusion of the property in the gross estate which forms the primary base for the measurement of the tax. And in that view the resulting tax attributable to such property is plainly indirect.\n\n 2. \nThe attack upon the Taking Act as constiting a violation of the Fifth Amendment is wholly without merit. The point made is that the tax is so arbitrary and capricious as to amount to confiscation, and therefore to result in a deprivation of property without due process of law. The tax, as we have just held, falls within the power of taxation granted to Congress, and the challenge becomes one not to the power, but to an abuse of it. The possibility that a federal statute passed under the taxing power may be so arbitrary and capricious as to cause it to fall before the due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment must be conceded ( Brushaber v. Union Pac. R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 24\n, 36 S. Ct. 236, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713, and cases cited; Nichols v. Coolidge, \n274 \nU.S. 531, 542\n, 47 S. Ct. 710, 52 A. L. R. 1081), but the present statute is not of that character. To include in the gross estate, for \n\n[281 U.S. 497, 505]\n\u00a0\n the purpose of measuring the tax, the value of property, no part of which originally belonged to one spouse, but which came to the tenancy, mediately or immediately, as a pure gift from the other, and which, as a consequence of the latter's death, was relieved from restrictions imposed by the law in respect of tenancy by the entirety so as to produce in the survivor the right of sole proprietorship, is obviously neither arbitrary nor capricious. The evident and legitimate aim of Congress was to prevent an avoidance, in whole or in part, of the estate tax by this method of disposition during the lifetime of the spouse who owned the property, or whose separate funds had been used to procure it; and the provision under review is an adjunct of the general scheme of taxation of which it is a part, entirely appropriate as a means to that end.

Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. Hugh R. Robertson, of San Antonio, Tex., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent was indicted under the Federal Corrupt Practices Act, 1925, Act of February 28, 1925, c. 368,  312, 43 Stat. 1053, 1073 (U. S. Code, title 18,  208 (18 USCA  208)), on charges that being a representative in Congress he received and was concerned in receiving specified sums of money from named officers and employees of the United States for the political purpose of promoting his nomination as Republican candidate for representative at certain Republican primaries. Upon motion of the defendant the District Court quashed the indictment on the ground that the statute should not be construed to include the political purpose alleged, and, construed to in \n\n[280 U.S. 396, 398]\n\u00a0\n clude it, probably would be unconstitutional (31 F.(2d) 774). The United States appealed.\n The section of the statute is as follows:\n'It is unlawful for any Senator or Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner, to, Congress, or any candidate for, or individual elected as, Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner, or any officer or employee of the United States, or any person receiving any salary or compensation for services from money derived from the Treasury of the United States, to directly or indirectly solicit, receive, or be in any manner concerned in soliciting or receiving, any assessment, subscription, or contribution for any political purpose whatever, from any other such officer, employee, or person.'\n\n This language is perfectly intelligible and clearly embraces the acts charged. Therefore there is no warrant for seeking refined arguments to show that the statute does not mean what it says unless there is some reasonable doubt whether so construed it would be constitutional-the doubt that was felt by the Court below.\n The doubt of the District Court seems to have come from the assumption that the source of power is to be found in article 1,  4, of the Constitution concerning the time, place and manner of holding elections, etc.; and from the decision that the control of party primaries is purely a State affair. Newberry v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 232\n, 41 S. Ct. 469. But the power of Congress over the conduct of officers and employees of the Government no more depends upon authority over the ultimate purposes of that conduct than its power to punish a use of the mails for a fraudulent purpose is limited by its inability to punish the intended fraud. Badders v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 391\n, 36 S. Ct. 367. It hardly needs argument to show that Congress may provide that its officers and employees neither shall exercise nor be subjected to pressure for money for political purposes, upon or by others of their \n\n[280 U.S. 396, 399]\n\u00a0\n kind, while they retain their office or employment. If argument and illustration are needed they will be found in Ex parte Curtis, \n106 \nU.S. 371\n, 1 S. Ct. 381, Id. (C. C.) 12 F. 824. See United States v. Thayer, \n209 \nU.S. 39, 42\n, 28 S. Ct. 426. Neither the Constitution nor the nature of the abuse to be checked requires us to confine the all embracing words of the Act to political purposes within the control of the United States.\n It is argued at some length that the statute, if extended beyond the political purposes under the control of Congress, is too vague to be valid. The objection to uncertainty concerning the persons embraced need not trouble us now. There is no doubt that the words include representatives, and if there is any difficulty, which we are far from intimating, it will be time enough to consider it when raised by some one whom it concerns. The other objection is to the meaning of 'political purpose.' This would be open even if we accepted the limitations that would make the law satisfactory to the respondent's counsel. But we imagine that no one not in search of trouble would feel any. Wherever the law draws a line there will be cases very near each other on opposite sides. The precise course of the line may be uncertain, but no one can come near it without knowing that he does so, if he thinks, and if he does so, it is familiar to the criminal law to make him take the risk. Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373\n, 33 S. Ct. 780\n\n\n It is said to be uncertain which of several sections imposes the penalty and therefore uncertain what the punishment is. That question can be raised when a punishment is to be applied. The elaborate argument against the constitutionality of the Act if interpreted as we read it, in accordance with its obvious meaning does not need an elaborate answer. The validity of the Act seems to us free from doubt. \n\n\n\n","127":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU. S. v. ADAMS(1930)\nNo. 281\nArgued: Decided: April 14, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 202, 203]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Sisson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United states.\n Mr. T. H. Caraway, of Jonesboro, Ark., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The defendant was indicted for a false entry in a book of a bank of which he was president, and which was a member of the Federal reserve system. The entry imported that he had made a deposit of $75,000 to the \n\n[281 U.S. 202, 204]\n\u00a0\n credit of himself and sons, which it is averred that he had not made. The book was a ledger showing the account of D. D. Adams & Sons, among others, with the bank. The defendant pleaded a former acquittal. The previous indictment was for a false entry in another book of the bank known as the journal ledger and daily balance book, and imported a remittance of $75, 000 to another bank to the credit of the defendant's own for which the defendant took credit as above stated. This remittance was a draft for $75, 000 which it was alleged that Adams was not entitled to draw. The two entries had reference to the same transaction, were based upon the same draft and were the correlated means of accomplishing a single fraud if fraud there had been. The District Court held that on its construction of Rev. St.  5209, as amended by the Act of September 26, 1918, c. 177,  7, 40 Stat. 967, 972; U. S. C. title 12,  592 (12 USCA  592), there could be but one prosecution for false entries based upon any single draft, even though several different entries were made in the different books of the bank, all relating to the same. Therefore it sustained the plea. The United States appealed.\n It is a short point. The statute punishes any officer of a Federal reserve bank who makes any false entry in any book of the bank with intent, etc. The Government contends for the most literal reading of the words, and that every such entry is a separate offense to be separately punished. But we think that it cannot have been contemplated that the mere multiplication of entries, all to the same point and with a single intent, should multiply the punishment in proportion to the complexity of the bookkeeping. The judgment in this case is affirmed.\n The second case presents a more delicate question than the previous one, although it was thought by the District Court to come under the same principle. This indictment is for a false entry in a report of conditions of the defendant's bank showing as due from banks other \n\n[281 U.S. 202, 205]\n\u00a0\n than Federal reserve banks $138,409.52 instead of the true sum $91,284.27. The plea of former acquittal we take as intended to allege that the difference was made by three items in respect of which the defendant had been indicted for false entries in the books of the bank, of a similar character to those in the other case, with intent to defraud the bank and the examiners appointed to examine its affairs. On this indictment also the defendant was acquitted. It is obvious that technically the plea was had because the offense alleged was a different offense. The report is not an entry in the books of the bank and does not purport to be a mere transcript of entries. It is a present affirmation as to the resources of the bank-a document different from the books of the bank and having a different purpose. But although not technically a former acquittal, the judgment was conclusive upon all that it decided. United States v. Oppenheimer, \n242 \nU.S. 85\n, 37 S. Ct. 68, 3 L. R. A. 516. It establishes that at the time of making the entries, the defendant was not guilty of an intent to defraud the bank or the examiners. It does not establish that the entries were true, although that might have been a ground for the verdict. Washington, Alexandria & Georgetown Steam Packet Co. v. Sickles, 5 Wall. 580; De Sollar v. Hanscome, \n158 \nU.S. 216, 221\n, 222 S., 15 S. Ct. 816. An alternative possible ground is that although the entries were untrue the defendant believed them to be true or for some reason believed them to be justified. However unlikely it may be that there was a different intent at the time of the later act from that with which the entries were made in the books of the bank, it is entirely possible that the defendant supposed himself to be acting lawfully at the earlier moment, but that he had acquired more accurate knowledge before he signed the report, that he then knew that it was false and was guilty then although not before.\n 281. Judgment affirmed.\n 282. Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU. S. v.

Fisher, of Chadron, Neb., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent was indicted for murder alleged to have been committed on a freight car on the right of way of the Chicago & Northwestern Railway Company on the Fort Robinson Military Reservation in Nebraska. He filed a plea to the jurisdiction of the United States upon \n\n[281 U.S. 138, 141]\n\u00a0\n the ground that the right of way was within the jurisdiction of the state of Nebraska. The District Court sustained the plea, 35 F.(2d) 750, and the Government brings the case here under the Criminal Appeals Act (34 Stat. 1246, U. S. C. tit. 18,  682 (18 USCA  682)).\n When Nebraska was admitted to the Union, the United States retained all right and title to the unappropriated public lands lying within the territory of Nebraska. Act of April 19, 1864, c. 59,  4, 13 Stat. 47, 48; Act of February 9, 1867, c. 36,  2, 14 Stat. 391, 392. By Executive Order of November 14, 1876, a portion of these lands was reserved for the Fort Robinson Military Reservation. In 1885, Congress granted the right of way in question to the Fremont, Elk Horn & Missouri Valley Railroad Company, a Nebraska corporation, 'across and through the Fort Robinson Military Reservation, located in said State of Nebraska, not to interfere with any buildings or improvements thereon, and the location thereof to be subject to the approval of the Secretary of War.' Act of January 20, 1885, c. 26, 23 Stat. 284. In 1887, Nebraska ceded to the United States 'the jurisdiction of the State of Nebraska in and over the military reservations known as Fort Niobrara and Fort Robinson' on the following conditions (Laws of Nebraska, 1887, p. 628):\n'Provided, That the jurisdiction hereby ceded shall continue no longer than the United States shall own and occupy such military reservations.\n\n'Sec. 2. The said jurisdiction is ceded upon the express condition that the State of Nebraska shall retain concurrent jurisdiction with the United States in and over the said military reservations so far as that all civil process in all cases, and such criminal or other process may issue under the laws or authority of the state of Nebraska against any person or persons charged with crime or misdemeanors committed within said state, may be executed therein in the same way and manner as if such jurisdiction \n\n[281 U.S. 138, 142]\n\u00a0\n had not been ceded except so far as such process may affect the real and personal property of the United States;\n\n'Provided, That nothing in the foregoing act shall be construed so as to prevent the opening and keeping in repair public roads and highways across and over said reservations.'\n\n When the United States acquires title to lands, which are purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state within which they are situated 'for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, Dock-yards, and other needful Buildings' (Const. art. I,  8), the Federal jurisdiction is exclusive of all State authority. With reference to land otherwise acquired, this court said in Fort Leavenworth Railroad Co. v. Lowe, \n114 \nU.S. 525, 539\n, 541 S., 5 S. Ct. 995, that a different rule applies; that is, that the land and the buildings erected thereon for the uses of the national government will be free from any such interference and jurisdiction of the state as would impair their effective use for the purposes for which the property was acquired. When, in such cases, a state cedes jurisdiction to the United States, the state may impose conditions which are not inconsistent with the carrying out of the purpose of the acquisition. Fort Leavenworth Railroad Co. v. Lowe, supra; Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co. v. McGlinn, \n114 \nU.S. 542\n, 5 S. Ct. 1005; Benson v. United States, \n146 \nU.S. 325, 330\n, 13 S. Ct. 60; Palmer v. Barrett, \n162 \nU.S. 399, 403\n, 16 S. Ct. 837; Arlington Hotel Co. v. Fant, \n278 \nU.S. 439, 451\n, 49 S. Ct. 227. The terms of the cession, to the extent that they may lawfully be prescribed, determine the extent of the Federal jurisdiction.\n In the present instance, there is no question of the status of the Fort Robinson Military Reservation. Nebraska ceded to the United States its entire jurisdiction over the reservation save in the matter of executing process and opening and repairing roads or highways. It was in this view that the Federal Circuit Court decided \n\n[281 U.S. 138, 143]\n\u00a0\n that, after this jurisdiction had been accepted by the United States, it could not be recaptured by the action of the state alone, and hence that an act of the legislature of Nebraska, passed in 1889, seeking to amend the act of cession was not effective, and that the statutes of the state regulating the sale of liquors were not in force within the ceded territory. In re Ladd (C. C.) 74 F. 31. The conditions of the cession relating to the execution of criminal process were construed as intended to save the right to execute process within the reservation for crimes committed outside; that is, to prevent the reservation from being a sanctuary for fugitive offenders.\n Accepting this construction of the conditions attached to the cession, we come to the question whether the jurisdiction over the reservation covered the right of way which Congress had granted to the railroad company. There was no express exception of jurisdiction over this right of way, and it cannot be said that there was any necessary implication creating such an exception. The proviso that the jurisdiction ceded should continue no longer than the United States shall own and occupy the reservation had reference to the future and cannot be regarded as limiting the cession of the entire reservation as it was known and described. As the right of way to be located with the approval of the Secretary of War rah across the reservation, it would appear to be impracticable for the state to attempt to police it, and the Federal jurisdiction may be considered to be essential to the appropriate enjoyment of the reservation for the purposes to which it was devoted. There is no adequate ground for cutting down the grant by construction.\n In 1911, a controversy arose with respect to fencing the right of way. The Secretary of War forbade the fencing and, in his communication to the railway company, said: 'The State, by Act of March 29, 1887, ceded exclusive jurisdiction over this reservation, subject to the \n\n[281 U.S. 138, 144]\n\u00a0\n usual reservations for service of process, and no statute of the State requiring railways to fence their rights of way can be regarded as operative within the reservation of Fort Robinson. Your right of way across the reservation divides in into two nearly equal parts. To place fences thereon would very greatly restrict the use of the reservation for drill and maneuver purposes, and, even though you should put in numerous passage-ways, would cause great inconvenience to the troops there stationed. ... By reason of the foregoing considerations, I am constrained to inform you that the Government will not permit the erection of fences along the right of way of your company within the Fort Robinson military reservation, and you are hereby notified to remove all such fences heretofore erected by your company.' The Supreme Court of Nebraska, in the case of Anderson v. Chicago & Northwestern Railway Co., 102 Neb. 578, 168 N. W. 196, held that this refusal of the Secretary of War to permit the erection of fences along the right of way constituted a defense to an action against the railway company for the killing of cattle, although a statute of the state, if it had governed the case, would have made the company liable because of the failure to enclose its tracks.\n The mere fact that the portion of the reservation in question is actually used as a railroad right of way is not controlling on the question of jurisdiction. Rights of way for various purposes, such as for railroads, ditches, pipe lines, telegraph and telephone lines across Federal reservations, may be entirely compatible with exclusive jurisdiction ceded to the United States. In Benson v. United States, supra, the jurisdiction of the Federal Court was sustained with respect to an indictment for murder committed on a portion of the Fort Leavenworth Military Reservation in Kansas which was used for farming purposes. In Arlington Hotel Co. v. Fant, supra, the \n\n[281 U.S. 138, 145]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction of the United States was upheld as to the portion of the reservation there in question which had been leased for use as a hotel. While the grant of the right of way to the railroad company contemplated a permanent use, this does not alter the fact that the maintenance of the jurisdiction of the United States over the right of way, as being within the reservation, might be necessary in order to secure the benefits intended to be derived from the reservation.\n We do not consider the decisions cited by the District Court as requiring a different view. In the case of Utah & Northern Railway Co. v. Fisher, \n116 \nU.S. 28\n, 6 S. Ct. 246, there was involved the right of the Territory of Idaho to tax the land and other property of the railroad which the company contended were within an Indian reservation and therefore not taxable. The company argued that the Indian reservation was excluded from the limits of the territory by the act of Congress creating the territory and also by a treaty with the Indians. The court held that neither position could be sustained. It appeared that no treaty with the Indians was in existence at the time Congress created the territory. The subsequent treaty did not require that the reservation should be excluded from the jurisdiction of the territory when the exercise of that jurisdiction would not defeat the stipulations of the treaty for the protection of the Indians, and the court found that the just rights of the Indians would not be impaired by the taxation of the railroad property. It also appeared that the Indians for a pecuniary consideration had ceded to the United States their title to so much of the reservation as might be needed for the uses of the railroad and that this strip of land was relinquished by Congress to the company. The court decided that in these circumstances and by force of the cession the land was withdrawn from the reservation. In Clairmont v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 551\n, 32 S. Ct. 787, the court held that onw who \n\n[281 U.S. 138, 146]\n\u00a0\n had liquor in his possession on a railroad train running on a right of way through the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana was not guilty of the offense of introducing liquor into the 'Indian country.' By agreement between the Indians and the United States, the Indians had surrendered all their 'right, title and interest,' the land had been freed from the Indian right of occupancy, and the Indian title had thus been entirely extinguished. The land could not be considered 'Indian country.'\n We conclude that the District Court erred in sustaining the plea.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

The usual order issued for proof of claims. The United States presented four claims arising under title 2 of Transportation Act 1920, February 28, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, 457-469. As to each claim it asserted that, by section 3466 of the Revised Statutes, U. S. C. tit. 31,  191 (31 USCA  191), it was entitled to preference and priority over the claims of all other creditors, secured or unsecured. Opposing creditors conceded that the railroad was insolvent within the meaning of section 3466. United States v. Butterwoth-Judson Corporation, \n269 \nU.S. 504\n, 46 S. Ct. 179. The insistence that the United States did not have priority was rested, among other grounds, upon the origin and character of its claims. The master and the District Court denied the United States priority over any creditor. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decree, but limited its decision to a denial of priority over secured creditors and those whose claims were preferred by local law or by the rule of Fosdick v. Schall, \n99 U.S. 235\n. It did not consider the relation of the government's claims to those of general creditors, because it concluded that the estate would not realize more than enough to satisfy the secured and preferred creditors, and because general creditors were not parties to the appeal. 33 F.(2d) 533. A writ of certiorari was granted. \n280 \nU.S. 546\n, 50 S. Ct. 40, 74 L. Ed. -.\n Title 2 of Transportation Act 1920, comprising sections 200 through 211 (41 Stat. 457-469), is headed 'Termination of Federal Control.' \n\n[280 U.S. 478, 481]\n\u00a0\n Section 207 (41 Stat. pp. 462, 463), provides that the 'indebtedness of each carrier to the United States, which may exist at the termination of Federal control, incurred for additions and betterments made during Federal control and properly chargeable to capital account ... shall, at the request of the carrier, be funded for a period of ten years from the termination of Federal control, or a shorter period at the option of the carrier'; and also that any other then existing indebtedness to the United States should be evidenced by notes payable in one year from the termination of federal control, or less at the option of the carrier. For both classes of debts, the carrier is to pay interest at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, and, in the discretion of the President, to give such security as he may require. \n1\n Two of the claims of the United States here in question are based on promissory notes made pursuant to this section. Each of the two notes is in the amount of $625,000. One is dated May 27, 1922, and is due March 1, 1930, 10 years after termination of federal control; the other is dated April 1, 1923, and is payable on demand. Each bears interest at 6 per cent., payable semiannually, and is secured by a deposit of the company's series A 50-year refunding and extension mortgage bonds, dated January 1, 1912\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 478, 482]\n\u00a0\n The third claim arose under section 209. That section (41 Stat. at p. 466) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, upon certification by the Interstate Commerce Commission, to advance to any carrier, on account of the guaranty of operating income there provided for the six months following the termination of federal control, sums 'necessary to enable it to meet its fixed charges and operating expenses'-the advances to be 'secured in such manner as the Secretary may determine'; and provides for repayment by the carrier of any amount proved to have been paid in excess of the guaranty. Compare Great Northern Ry. Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 172\n, 48 S. Ct. 466. The amount claimed by the United States under this section is $292,022.23, which sum the Interstate Commerce Commission certified had been advanced in excess of the guaranteed amount. See Guaranty Settlement With Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R., 86 I. C. C. 691.\n The fourth claim arose under section 210 (p. 468). 'For the purpose of enabling carriers ... properly to serve the public during the transition period immediately following the termination of Federal control,' that section, as amended by Act of June 5, 1920, c. 235,  5, 41 Stat. 874, 946, authorizes loans by the government to carriers, if a loan is required by a carrier 'to meet its maturing indebtedness, or to provide itself with equipment or other additions and betterments.' The loans are to be made only on security; for a period not in excess of 15 years; and, if application therefor is made to the Interstate Commerce Commission within 2 years from the termination of federal control. And no loan can be made, unless the Commission first finds and certifies that the loan is necessary to enable the applicant to meet the transportation needs of the public; 'that the prospective earning power of the applicant and the character and value of the security offered are such as to furnish reasonable assurance of the applicant's ability to repay the loan within the time \n\n[280 U.S. 478, 483]\n\u00a0\n fixed therefor, and to meet its other obligations in connection with such loan ... and that the applicant ... is unable to provide itself with the funds necessary for the aforesaid purposes from other sources.' The claim under this section is on a promissory note for $1,382,000 dated April 1, 1921, which was given in consideration of a loan of that amount, made to enable the company to pay a maturing issue of its outstanding mortgage bonds. The note is payable in 10 years, with interest semiannually at the rate of 6 per cent. and is secured by a deposit of the company's series A, 50-year refunding and extension mortgage bonds, dated January 1, 1912. See Loan to Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R., 67 I. C. C. 321, 323; Bonds of Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R., 67 I. C. C. 362.\n The alleged priority of the United States under section 3466 (31 USCA  191) over mortgages and over unsecured claims preferred by local law ( compare Spokane County v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 80\n, 49 S. Ct. 321), or by the rule of Fosdick v. Schall, supra, was discussed in the lower courts and was argued by counsel before this Court. But we have no occasion to consider these questions. For, we are of opinion that it was the purpose of Congress that section 3466 (31 USCA  191) should not apply to any indebtedness of the railroads to the United States arising under sections 207, 209 or 210 of Transportation Act 1920.\n During federal control, the government had been obliged to provide most of the new capital required for equipment, improvements, and extensions,2 and some of the funds needed to meet current interest and dividend payments. \n3\n The Federal Control Act, March 21, 1918, c. 25, \n\n[280 U.S. 478, 484]\n\u00a0\n s 6, 40 Stat. 451, 455, appropriated $500,000,000 to 'be used by the President as a revolving fund for the purpose,' among other things, of providing 'terminals, motive power, cars, and other necessary equipment.' The Act of June 30, 1919, c. 5, 41 Stat. 34, appropriated $750,000,000 more. The Transportation Act, 1920,  202 (41 Stat. 459; 49 USCA  72) and  210(e), 41 Stat. 468, made a similar provision in appropriating, for the purposes of title 2, $500,000,000, in addition to the sums otherwise available, and in addition to the general appropriations made in sections 204(g) and 209(g), (h), and (i) ( 41 Stat. 461, 466, 467; 49 USCA  73, 77).\n These appropriations were made in order to meet a pressing need. At the time of the passage of Transportation Act 1920, most of the railroads of the United States lacked funds for necessary improvements, equipment, and expansion of facilities. Some of the carriers needed funds, also, to meet maturing obligations. The credit of many carriers was seriously impaired. There was a general reluctance among investors to purchase new railroad securities even of the strongest railroads. Congress deemed it important to preserve for the nation substantially the whole existing transportation system. Compare New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 190\n, 43 S. Ct. 270. In order to accomplish this, it was thought necessary that the United \n\n[280 U.S. 478, 485]\n\u00a0\n States should, to a certain extent, finance the carriers until it would become possible to restore their credit, by increase of rates or otherwise. The provisions of title 2 of Transportation Act, 1920, were framed to that end. Through them, the financial aid which had been given during Federal control was to be extended for a further period.\n To have given priority to debts due the United States pursuant to title 2 would have defeated the purpose of Congress. It not only would have prevented the reestablishment of railroad credit among bankers and investors, but it would even have seriously impaired the market value of outstanding railroad securities. It would have deprived the carriers of the credit commonly enjoyed from supplymen and others; would have seriously embarrassed the carriers in their daily operations; and would have made necessary a great enlargement of their working capital. The provision for loans under section 210 would have been frustrated. For, carriers could ill afford voluntarily to contract new debts thereunder which would displace, pro tanto, their existing bonded indebtedness. The entire spirit of the act makes clear the purpose that the rule leading to such consequences should not be applied.\n Moreover, Congress evidenced unmistakably its purpose to rely, for obtaining payment of the Government's advances, upon means other than the priority provided for by section 3466 (31 USCA  191). Under all of the sections, the giving of adequate security was either required or left to the discretion of the President. Under section 210 no advance could be made, unless the Interstate Commerce Commission was satisfied that the earning power of the carrier and the security given furnished reasonable assurance that the loan would be repaid and all obligations in connection therewith would be performed. 4 The interest rate re- \n\n[280 U.S. 478, 486]\n\u00a0\n quired is much greater than that which ordinarily accompanies even a business loan carrying such assurance of repayment as would have resulted from an application of the priority rule. Thus, both the general purposes of title 2 and its specific provisions make it clear that Congress intended to exclude the indebtedness so arising from the scope of section 3466 of the Revised Statutes (31 USCA  191) just as under the Federal Control Act it had excluded therefrom claims incident to current operation of the railroads.

The Transportation Act of 1920 in Section 207, anticipated that the carriers might not be able to pay out of the compensation and other sums due them from the Government all the sums due the Government on account of capital expenditure, and therefore provided that only so much of the indebtedness due from the United States to the carriers should be offset by the indebtedness due the United States from the carriers 'as deemed wise by the President,' and further provided that any funding obtained by the carriers should be granted only upon their giving security in such form and upon such terms as the President may prescribe. ...' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See note 1, supra.

Tingley, both of Baltimore, Md., for West and others.\n\n\n[280 U.S. 234, 247]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The first of these titles (No. 55) is an appeal, and the second (No. 64) a cross-appeal, from a decree of the Court of Appeals of Maryland. The case arose from an order of the state Public Service Commission, limiting the rate of passenger fares to be charged by the United Railways & Electric Company for carrying passengers over its lines in the city of Baltimore. The company, by its appeal, attacks the Commission's order as confiscatory. The cross-appeal seeks to raise the question whether the amount for annual depreciation allowed the company should be calculated upon the present value of the company's property or upon its cost.\n Upon application of the company to the Commission, made in 1927, for an increase in fares, the Commission passed an order making an increase, but not to the extent sought. Thereupon suit was brought in a state circuit court on the grounds that the rate fixed by the Commission was confiscatory and that the annual allowance for depreciation was calculated upon a wrong basis, namely, upon cost, instead of present value, of depreciable property. The circuit court, in an able opinion, sustained the company upon both grounds, and enjoined the enforcement of the Commission's order. On appeal, the Court of Appeals upheld the view of the circuit court in respect of depreciation, but held the rate of return not confiscatory. Public Service Commission v. United Railways & Electric Co. of Baltimore, 155 Md. 572, 142 A. 870. Thereupon, the Commission increased the depreciation allowance in accordance with the decree of the court and adjusted the rate of fare to the extent necessary to absorb the increased allowance. A second suit and an appeal to the Court of Appeals followed, and that court entered a decree (157 Md. 70, 145 A. 340) sustaining the action of the Commission; and it is that decree which is here for review. \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 248]\n\u00a0\n The facts, so far as we find it necessary to review them, are not in dispute. The company since 1899 has owned and operated all the street railway lines in the city of Baltimore. Its present capital structure consists of $24,000,000 of common stock, $38,000,000 of ordinary bonded indebtedness, and $14,000,000 of perpetual income bonds redeemable at the option of the company after 1949. Due to the increased use of automobiles, the total number of passengers carried has for some time steadily decreased, while the number carried during the 'rush hours' has increased. This has resulted in an increase of expenses in proportion to the whole number of passengers carried, since equipment, etc., must be maintained and men employed sufficient to care for the increased business of the 'rush hours,' notwithstanding their reduced productiveness during the hours of decreased business. Since the war operating expenses have almost, if not quite, doubled.\n The present value of the property used was fixed by the Commission at $ 75,000,000, and this amount was accepted without question by both parties in the state circuit court and in the Court of Appeals. Included in this valuation is $5,000,000 for easements in the streets of Baltimore. The Court of Appeals had held in another and earlier case, Miles v. Pub. Serv. Commission, 151 Md. 337, 135 A. 579, 49 A. L. R. 1470, that the easements constituted an interest in real estate and that in making up the rate base their value should be included. The Commission in the present case, accordingly, included the amount in the valuation and made no attack upon the item in the courts below, where it passed as a matter not in dispute. The item is now challenged by counsel for the Commission in this court, and other objections to the valuation are suggested, likewise for the first time. We do not find it necessary to consider this challenge or these objections, for, if they \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 249]\n\u00a0\n ever possessed substance, they come too late. In the further consideration of the case, therefore, we accept, for all purposes, the valuation of $75, 000,000 as it was accepted and acted upon by parties, commission, and courts below.\n The Commission fixed a rate of fare permitting the company to earn a return of 6.26 per cent. on this valuation, and, so far as No. 55 is concerned, the case resolves itself into the simple question whether that return is so inadequate as to result in a deprivation of property in violation of the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In answering that question, the fundamental principle to be observed is that the property of a public utility, although devoted to the public service and impressed with a public interest, is still private property, and neither the corpus of that property nor the use thereof constitutionally can be taken for a compulsory price which falls below the measure of just compensation. One is confiscation no less than the other.\n What is a fair return within this principle cannot be settled by invoking decisions of this court made years ago, based upon conditions radically different from those which prevail to-day. The problem is one to be tested primarily by present-day conditions. Annual returns upon capital and enterprise, like wages of employees, cost of maintenance, and related expenses, have materially increased the country over. This is common knowledge. A rate of return upon capital invested in street railway lines and other public utilities, which might have been proper a few years ago, no longer furnishes a safe criterion either for the present or the future. Lincoln Gas Co. v. Lincoln, \n250 \nU.S. 256, 268\n, 39 S. Ct. 454. Nor can a rule be laid down which will apply uniformly to all sorts of utilities. What may be a fair return for one may be inadequate for another, depending upon circumstances, locality, and risk. \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 250]\n\u00a0\n Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n212 U.S. 19\n, 48-50, 50, 29 S. Ct. 192, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1134, 15 Ann. Cas. 1034. The general rule recently has been stated in Bluefield Water Works & Improvement Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., \n262 U.S. 679\n, 692-695, 43 S. Ct. 675, 679:\n'What annual rate will constitute just compensation depends upon many circumstances, and must be determined by the exercise of a fair and enlightened judgment, having regard to all relevant facts. A public utility is entitled to such rates as will permit it to earn a return on the value of the property which it employs for the convenience of the public equal to that generally being made at the same time and in the same general part of the country on investments in other business undertakings which are attended by corresponding risks and uncertainties; but it has no constitutional right to profits such as are realized or anticipated in highly profitable enterpises or speculative ventures. The return should be reasonably sufficient to assure confidence in the financial soundness of the utility and should be adequate, under efficient and economical management, to maintain and support its credit and enable it to raise the money necessary for the proper discharge of its public duties. A rate of return may be reasonable at one time and become too high or too low by changes affecting opportunities for investment, the money market and business conditions generally. ...\n\n'Investors take into account the result of past operations, especially in recent years, when determining the terms upon which they will invest in such an undertaking. Low, uncertain, or irregular income makes for low prices for the securities of the utility and higher rates of interest to be demanded by investors. The fact that the company may not insist as a matter of constitutional right that past losses be made up by rates to be applied in the present and future tends to weaken credit, and the fact that the utility is protected against being compelled \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 251]\n\u00a0\n to serve for confiscatory rates tends to support it. In this case the record shows that the rate of return has been low through a long period up to the time of the inquiry by the commission here involved.'\n\n What will constitute a fair return in a given case is not capable of exact mathematical demonstration. It is a matter more or less of approximation, about which conclusions may differ. The court in the discharge of its constitutional duty on the issue of confiscation must determine the amount to the best of its ability in the exercise of a fair, enlightened, and 'independent judgment as to both law and facts.' Ohio Valley Water Co. v. Ben Avon Borough, \n253 \nU.S. 287, 289\n, 40 S. Ct. 527, 528; Bluefield, etc., Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., supra, pages \n262 \nU.S. 689, 692\n, 43 S. Ct. 675; Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. Commissioners, \n278 \nU.S. 24, 36\n, 49 S. Ct. 69, 62 A. L. R. 805.\n There is much evidence in the record to the effect that, in order to induce the investment of capital in the enterprise or to enable the company to compete successfully in the market for money to finance its operations, a net return upon the valuation fixed by the Commission should not be far from 8 per cent. Since 1920 the company has borrowed from time to time some $18,000,000, upon which it has been obliged to pay an average rate of interest ranging well over 7 per cent. and this has been the experience of street railway lines quite generally. Upon the valuation fixed, with an allowance for depreciation calculated with reference to that valuation, and upon the then prescribed rates, the company for the years 1920 to 1926, both inclusive, obtained a return of little more than 5 per cent. per annum. It is manifest that just compensation for a utility, requiring for efficient public service skillful and prudent management as well as use of the plant, and whose rates are subject to public regulation, is more than current interest on mere investment. Sound business management requires that, after paying all expenses of operation, setting aside the necessary sums for depre- \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 252]\n\u00a0\n ciation, payment of interest, and reasonable dividends, there should still remain something to be passed to the surplus account, and a rate of return which does not admit of that being done is not sufficient to assure confidence in the financial soundness of the utility to maintain its credit and enable it to raise money necessary for the proper discharge of its public duties. In this view of the matter, a return of 6.26 per cent. is clearly inadequate. In the light of recent decisions of this court and other federal decisions, it is not certain that rates securing a return of 7 1\/2 per cent., or even 8 per cent., on the value of the property would not be necessary to avoid confiscation.* But this we need not decide, since the company itself sought from the Commission a rate which it appears would produce a return of about 7.44 per cent., at the same time insisting that such return fell short of being adequate. Upon the present record, we are of opinion that to enforce rates producing less than this would be confiscatory and in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Complaint also is made of the action of the Commission in abolishing the second fare zone established by the \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 253]\n\u00a0\n company on what is called the Halethorpe line and substituting a single fare for the two fares theretofore exacted. Halethorpe is an unincorporated community lying outside the limits of Baltimore city. With a single fare, the extension of the line to Halethorpe is not profitable, but, nevertheless, it is an integral part of the railway system, and it will be enough if the Commission shall so readjust the fares as to yield a fair return upon the property, including the Halethorpe line, as a whole. If, in doing so, the Commission shall choose, not to restore the second fare, but to retain in force the single fare, we perceive no constitutional objection.\n The Commission sought a review of the question in respect of the annual depreciation allowance, both by a cross-appeal and, later, by petition for certiorari. The question of jurisdiction on the cross-appeal as well as the consideration of the petition for certiorari were postponed to the hearing on the merits. We do not now find it necessary to decide either matter. As the amount of depreciation to be allowed was contested throughout, is a necessary element to be determined in fixing the rate of fare and is closely related in substance to the case brought here by the company's appeal, it well may be considered in connection therewith. In these circumstances neither cross-appeal nor certiorari is necessary to present the question.\n The allowance for annual depreciation made by the Commission was based upon cost. The Court of Appeals held that this was erroneous and that it should have been based upon present value. The court's view of the matter was plainly right. One of the items of expense to be ascertained and deducted is the amount necessary to restore property worn out or impaired, so as continuously to maintain it as nearly as practicable at the same level of efficiency for the public service. The amount set aside \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 254]\n\u00a0\n periodically for this purpose is the so-called depreciation allowance. Manifestly, this allowance cannot be limited by the original cost, because, if values have advanced, the allowance is not sufficient to maintain the level of efficiency. The utility 'is entitled to see that from earnings the value of the property invested is kept unimpaired, so that, at the end of any given term of years, the original investment remains as it was at the beginning.' Knoxville v. Water Co., \n212 U.S. 1\n, 13-14, 29 S. Ct. 148, 152. This naturally calls for expenditures equal to the cost of the worn-out equipment at the time of replacement; and this, for all practical purposes, means present value. It is the settled rule of this court that the rate base is present value, and it would be wholly illogical to adopt a different rule for depreciation. As the Supreme Court of Michigan, in Michigan Public Utilities Commission v. Telephone Co., 228 Mich. 658, 666, 200 N. W. 749, 752, has aptly said: 'If the rate base is present fair value, then the depreciation base as to depreciable property is the same thing. There is no principle to sustain a holding that a utility may earn on the present fair value of its property devoted to public service, but that it must accept and the public must pay depreciation on book cost or investment cost, regardless of present fair value. We repeat, the purpose of permitting a depreciation charge is to compensate the utility for property consumed in service, and the duty of the commission, guided by experience in rate making, is to spread this charge fairly over the years of the life of the property.' And see Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., \n262 \nU.S. 276, 288\n, 43 S. Ct. 544, 31 A. L. R. 807; Georgia Ry. & Power Co. v. R. R. Comm., \n262 \nU.S. 625, 633\n, 43 S.

United Railways & Electric Co., 155 Md. 572, 142 A. 870, the Commission entered, on November 28, 1928, an order permitting the Railways to increase its rate of fare to 10 cents cash, four tokens for 35 cents. \n1\n That order was sustained in United Railways & Electric Co. v. West, 157 Md. 70, 145 A. 340, and the Railways has appealed to this court. The claim is that the order confiscates its property because the fare fixed will yield, according to the estimates, no more than 6.26 per cent. upon the assumed value. There are several reasons why I think the order should be held valid.\n A net return of 6.26 per cent. upon the present value of the property of a street railway enjoying a monopoly in one of the oldest, largest and richest cities on the Atlantic Seaboard would seem to be compensatory. Moreover, the estimated return is in fact much larger, if the \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 256]\n\u00a0\n rules which I deem applicable are followed. It is 6.70 per cent. if, in valuing the rate base, the prevailing rule which eliminates franchises from a rate base is applied. And it is 7.78 per cent. if also, in lieu of the deduction for deprecitation ordered by the Court of Appeals, the amount is fixed, either by the method of an annual depreciation charge computed according to the rules commonly applied in business, or by some alternative method, at the sum which the long experience of this railways proves to have been adequate for it.\n First. The value of the plant adopted by the Commission as the rate base was fixed by it at $75,000,000 in a separate valuation case, decided on March 9, 1926, modified, pursuant to directions of the Court of Appeals, 2 on February 1, 1928, and not before us for review. In re United Railways & Electric Co., P. U. R. 1926C, 441, P. U. R. 1928B, 737. Included in this total is $5,000,000 representing the value placed upon the Railways' so-called 'easements.' If they are excluded, the estimated yield found by the Commission would be increased by .44 per cent.; that is, the net earnings, estimated at '4,691,606 would yield, on a $70,000,000 rate base, 6.70 per cent. The people's counsel contended that, since these 'easements' are merely the privileges gratuitously granted to the Railways by various county and municipal franchises to lay tracks and operate street cars on the public highways,3 they should be excluded from the rate base when considering whether the order is confiscatory in violation of the federal Constitution. This alleged error of federal law in the valuation may be considered on this appeal; for the rate allowed by the Commission is attacked on the assumption that the return on the property is only \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 257]\n\u00a0\n 6.26 per cent. \n4\n Compare United States v. American Ry. Express Co., \n265 \nU.S. 425, 435\n, 44 S. Ct. 560; Union Tool Co. v. Wilson, \n259 \nU.S. 107, 111\n, 42 S. Ct. 427.\n Where a rate order is alleged to be void under the federal Constitution because confiscatory, the question whether a specific class of property should be included in the rate base is to be determined not by the state, law, but by the federal law. Whether the return is sufficient under the state law is a question which does not concern us. We are concerned solely with the adequacy or inadequacy of the return under the guaranties of the federal law. In determining whether a prescribed rate is confiscatory under the federal Constitution, franchises are not to be included in valuing the plant, except for such amounts as were actually paid to the state, or a political subdivision thereof, as consideration for the grant. Cedar Rapids Gas Light Co. v. Cedar Rapids, \n223 \nU.S. 655, 669\n, 32 S. Ct. 389; Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, \n238 \nU.S. 153, 169\n, 35 S. Ct. 811; Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, \n258 \nU.S. 388, 396\n, 42 S. Ct. 351; Georgia Ry. & Power Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 625, 632\n, 43 S. Ct. 680.5 Franchises to lay pipes or tracks in the public streets, like franchises to conduct the business as a corporation, are not donations to a utility of property by the use of which profit may be made. They are privileges granted to utilities to enable them to employ their \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 258]\n\u00a0\n property in the public service and make profit out of such use of that property. As stated in the New Hampshire statute, 'all such franchises, rights and privilges being granted in the public interest only' are 'not justly subject to capitalization against the public.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Had the 'easements' been called franchises, it is probable that no value would have been ascribed to them for rate-making purposes. For the Maryland Public Utilities Law, in common with the statutes of many states, 7 forbids the capitalization of franchises. But calling these privileges 'easements' does not differentiate them for rate purposes from ordinary corporate franchises, when applying the federal Constitution. In none of the cases excluding franchises from plant value was any distinction made, in this respect, between ordinary corporate franchises and franchises to use the public streets, although many of the cases involved privileges of the latter type. \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 259]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Appeals and the Commission were influenced by the fact that the so-called 'easements' were taxed. This fact does not justify including them in the rate base. Corporate franchises are frequently taxed,8 and, although taxed, are not valued for rate purposes. Compare Georgia Ry. & Power Co. v. Railroad Commission (D. C.) 278 F. 242, 244, 245. The 'easements' differ from ordinary franchises only in the technicality that, under the law of Maryland, the right to use the streets is, for taxation purposes, real property, whereas ordinary franchises are personal property.\n Second. The amount which the Commission fixed, in its original report, as the appropriate depreciation charge was $883,544. That sum is 5 per cent. of the estimated gross revenues. Referring to the method of arriving at the amount of the charge the Commission there said: 'The Commission believes that it might be more logical to base the annual allowance for depreciation upon the cost of depreciable property, rather than upon gross revenues. The relation between gross revenues and depreciation is remote and indirect while there is a direct relation between the cost of a piece of property and the amount that ought to be set aside for its consumption by use. However, the allowance which this Commission has made for depreciation, 5 per cent. of the gross revenues, has provided fairly well for current depreciation and retirements. ... Moreover, there is a broad twilight zone between depreciation and maintenance, and it may well be ( and without any impropriety) that the maintenance account has been sued to a certain extent to provide for depreciation. ... Any increase in the gross revenues resulting from an increase in fares would increase the amounts that would be set aside for depreciation and \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 260]\n\u00a0\n maintenance.' \n9\n Without deciding that this allowance was inadequate, the Court of Appeals held that, as a matter of law, the depreciation charge should be based upon the then value of the depreciable property as distinguished from its cost; and directed the Commission to revise its estimates accordingly. Pursuant to that direction, the Commission added, in its supplemental report, $755,116 to the depreciation charge. The addition was, I think, ordered by the Court of Appeals under a misapprehension of the nature and function of the depreciation charge. And, in considering the adequacy of the return under the federal Constitution, the estimate of the net earnings should accordingly be increased by $755, 116, which, on the rate base of $70,000,000, would add 1.08 per cent. to the estimated return.\n That the Court of Appeals erred in its decisionbecomes clear when the nature and purpose of the depreciation charge are analyzed and the methods of determining its proper amount are considered. The annual account of a street railway, or other business, is designed to show the profit or loss, and to acquaint those interested with the condition of the business. To be true, the account must reflect all the operating expenses incurred within the accounting period. One of these is the wearing out of plant. Minor parts, which have short lives and are consumed wholly within the year, are replaced as a part of current repairs. \n10\n Larger plant units, unlike supplies, do \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 261]\n\u00a0\n not wear out within a single accounting period. They have varying service lives, some remaining useful for many years. Experience teaches that at the end of some period of time most of these units, too, will wear out physically or cease to be useful in the service. If the initial outlay for such units is entirely disregarded, the annual account will not reflect the true results of operation and the initial investment may be lost. If, on the other hand, this original expense is treated as part of the operating expenses of the year in which the plant unit was purchased, or was retired or replaced, the account again will not reflect the true results of operation. For operations in one year will then be burdened with an expense which is properly chargeable against a much longer period of use. Therefore, in ascertaining the profits of a year, it is generally deemed necessary to apportion to the operations of that year a part of the total expense incident to the wearing out of plant. This apportionment is commonly made by means of a depreciation charge. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n It is urged by the Railways that if the base used in determining what is a fair return on the use of its property is the present value, then logically the base to be used in determining the depreciation charge-a charge for the consumption of plant in service-must also be the pres- \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 262]\n\u00a0\n ent value of the property consumed. \n12\n Much that I said about valuation in Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., \n262 \nU.S. 276, 289\n, 43 S. Ct. 544, 31 A. L. R. 807, and St. Louis & O'Fallon R. R. Co. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 461, 488\n, 49 S. Ct. 384, applies to the depreciation charge. But acceptance of the doctrine of Smyth v. Ames does not require that the depreciation charge be based on present value of plant; for an annual depreciation charge is not a measure of the actual consumption of plant during the year. No such measure has yet been invented. There is no regularity in the development of depreciation. It does not proceed in accordance with any mathematical law. There is nothing in business experience or in the training of experts, which enables man to say to what extent service life will be impaired by the operations of a single year, or of a series of years less than the service life. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n[280 U.S. 234, 263]\n\u00a0\n Where a plant intended, like a street railway, for continuing operation is maintained at a constant level of efficiency, it is rarely possible to determine definitely whether or not its service life has in fact lessened within a particular year. The life expectancy of a plant, like that of an individual, may be in fact greater, because of unusual repairs or other causes, at the end of a particular year than it was at the beginning. \n14\n And even where it is known that there has been some lessening of service life within the year it is never possible to determine with accuracy what percentage of the unit's service life has, in fact, been so consumed. Nor is it essential to the aim of the charge that this fact should be known. The main purpose of the charge is that irrespective of the rate of depreciation there shall be produced, through annual contributions, by the end of the service life of the depreciable plant, an amount equal to the total net expense of its retirement. 15 \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 264]\n\u00a0\n To that end it is necessary only that some reasonable plan of distribution be adopted. Since it is impossible to ascertain what percentage of the service life is consumed in any year,16 it is either assumed that depreciation proceeds at some average rate (thus accepting the approximation to fact customarily obtained through the process of averaging) or the annual charge is fixed without any regard to the rate of depreciation.\n The depreciation charge is an allowance made pursuant to a plan of distribution of the total net expense of plant retirement. It is a bookkeeping device introduced in the exercise of practical judgment to serve three purposes. It preserves the integrity of the investment. Compare Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Company, \n212 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 14 S., 29 S. Ct. 148. It serves to distribute equitably throughout the several years of service life the only expense of plant retirement which is capable of reasonable ascertainment-the known cost less the estimated salvage value. And it enables those interested, through applying that plan of distribution, to ascertain, as nearly as is possible, the actual financial results of the year's operation. Many methods of calculating the amount of the allowance are used. \n17\n The charges to operating expenses in the several years and in the aggregate vary according to the method adopted. \n18\n But under none of these methods of fixing the depreciation charge is an attempt made to determine the percentage of actual consumption of plant falling within a par- \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 265]\n\u00a0\n ticular year or within any period of years less than the service life. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n Third. The business device known as the depreciation charge appears not to have been widely adopted in America until after the beginning of this century. 20 Its use is still stoutly resisted by many concerns. \n21\n Whereever adopted, the depreciation charge is based on the original cost of the plant to the owner. when the great changes in price levels incident to the World War led some to \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 266]\n\u00a0\n question the wisdom of the practice of basing the charge on original cost, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States warned business men against the fallacy of departing from the accepted basis. \n22\n And that warning has been recently repeated: 'When the cost of an asset, less any salvage value, has been recovered, the process of depreciation stops; the consumer has paid for that particular item of service. There are those who maintain that the obligation of the consumer is one rather of replacement-building for building, machine for machine. According to this view depreciation should be based on replacement cost rather than actual cost. The replacement theory substitutes for something certain and definite, the actual cost, a cost of reproduction which is highly speculative and conjectural and requiring frequent revision. It, moreover, seeks to establish for one expense a basis of computation fundamentally different from that used for the other expenses of doing business. Insurance is charged on a basis of actual premiums paid, not on the basis of probable premiums three years hence; renton the amound actually paid, not on the problematical rate of the next lease, salaries, light, heat, power, supplies are all charged at actual, not upon a future contingent cost. As one writer has expressed it: 'The fact that the plant cannot be replaced at the same cost, but only at much more, has nothing to do with the cost of its product, but only with the cost of future product turned out by the subsequent plant.' As the product goes through your factory it should be burdened with expired, not anticipated, costs. Charge depreciation upon actual cost less any salvage.' \n23\n\u00a0\n\n[280 U.S. 234, 267]\n\u00a0\n Such is to-day, and ever has been, the practice of public accountants. 24 Their statements are prepared in accordance with principles of accounting which are well established, generally accepted and uniformly applied. By \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 268]\n\u00a0\n those accustomed to read the language of accounting a depreciation charge is understood as meaning the appropriate contribution for that year to the amount required to make good the cost of the plant which ultimately must be retired. On that basis, public accountants certify to investors and bankers the results of operation, whether of public utilities, or of manufacturing or mercantile concerns. Corporate securities are issued, bought and sold, and vast loans are made daily, in reliance upon statements so prepared. The compelling logic of facts which led business men to introduce a depreciation charge has led them to continue to base it on the original cost of the plant despite the great changes in the price level incident to the World War. Basing the depreciation charge on cost is a rule prescribed or recommended by theose associations of business men who have had occasion since the World War to consider the subject. \n25\n\u00a0\n\n[280 U.S. 234, 269]\n\u00a0\n Business men naturally took the plant at cost, as that is how they treat other articles consumed in operation. The plant, undepreciated, is commonly carried on the books at cost; and it is retired at cost. The net profit or \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 270]\n\u00a0\n loss of a business transaction is commonly ascertained by deducting from the gross receipts the expenditures incurred in producing them. Business men realized fully that the requirements for replacement might be more or less than the original cost. But they realized also that to attempt to make the depreciation account reflect economic conditions and changes would entail entry upon new fields of conjecture and prophecy which would defeat its purposes. For there is no basis in experience which can justify predicting whether a replacement, renewal or substitution falling in some future year will cost more or less than it would at present, or more or less than the unit cost when it was acquired.\n The business men's practice of using a depreciation charge based on the original cost of the plant in determining the profits or losses of a particular year has abundant official sanction and encouragement. The practice was prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1907,26 when, in cooperation with the Association of American Railway Accounting Officers, it drafted the rule, which is still in force,27 requiring steam railroads to make \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 271]\n\u00a0\n an annual depreciation charge on equipment. It has been consistently applied by the federal government in assessing taxes on net income and corporate profits,28 and by the tax officials of the several states for determining the net profits or income of individuals and corporations. \n29\n Since 1911, it has been applied by the United States Bureau of the Census. 30 Since 1915, it has been recommended \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 272]\n\u00a0\n by the Department of Agriculture. 31 Since 1917 by the Bureau of Mines. \n32\n In 1916, it was adopted by the Federal Trade Commission in recommendations concerning depreciation issued to manufacturers. \n33\n In 1917, it was prescribed by the United States Fuel Administration,34 and by the War Ordnance Department. \n35\n In 1918, by the Air Craft Production Board. \n36\n In 1921, it was prescribed by the Federal Power Commission;37 and it is continued in the revised rules of 1928.38 In 1923, it was adopted by the depreciation section of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the report of tentative conclusions concerning depreciation charges submitted to the \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 273]\n\u00a0\n steam railroads, telephone companies and carriers by water,39 pursuant to paragraph 5 of section 20, of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by Transportation Act 1920.40 On November 2, 1926, it was prescribed by the Commission in Telephone and Railroad Depreciation Charges, 118 I. C. C. 295. A depreciation charge based on original cost has been uniformly applied by the public utility commissions of the several states when determining net income, past or expected, for rate-making purposes. \n41\n\u00a0\n\n[280 U.S. 234, 274]\n\u00a0\n Fourth. In 1927 the business men's practice of basing the depreciation charge on cost was applied by this court in United States v. Ludey, \n274 \nU.S. 295, 300\n, 301 S., 47 S. Ct. 608, 610, a federal income tax case saying: 'The amount of the allowance for depreciation is the sum which should be set aside for the taxable year, in order that, at the end of the use- \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 275]\n\u00a0\n ful life of the plant in the business, the aggregate of the sums set aside will (with the salvage value) suffice to provide an amount equal to the original cost.' \n42\n I know of nothing in the federal Constitution, or in the decisions of this court, which should lead us to reject in determining net profits, the rule sanctioned by the universal practice of business men and governmental departments. For, whether the expense in plant consumption can be more \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 276]\n\u00a0\n nearly approximated by using a depreciation charge based on original cost or by one based upon fluctuating present values is a problem to be solved, not by legal reasoning, but by the exercise of practical judgment based on facts and business experience. The practice of using an annual depreciation charge based on original cost43 when determining for purposes of investment, taxation or regulation, the net profits of a business, or the return upon property was not adopted in ignorance of the rule of Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466\n, 18 S. Ct. 418. That decision, rendered in 1898, antedates the general employment of public accountants, 44 and also antedates the general introduction here of the practice of making a depreciation charge. The decision of the Court of Appeals of Maryland here under review, as well as State ex rel. Hopkins v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 115 Kan. 236, 223 P. 771,45 and Michigan Public Utilities Commission v. Michigan State Telephone Co., 228 Mich. 658, 200 N. W. 749,46 were all decided after this court reaffirmed the rule \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 277]\n\u00a0\n of Smyth v. Ames in Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n262 \nU.S. 276\n, 43 S. Ct. 544, 31 A. and as part of its net income, in its income the Bell Telephone Companies have persisted in basing their depreciation charges upon the original cost of the depreciable property. Board of Public Utility Com'rs v. New York Tel. Co., \n271 \nU.S. 23, 27\n, 46 S. Ct. 363. And they have insisted that the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission requiring a depreciation charge, 118 I. C. C. 295, should be so framed as to permit the continuance of that accounting practice. \n47\n The protest of the railroads, in that proceeding, against basing the charge on cost was made for the first time in 1927, in their petitions for a rehearing. And this protest came only from those who insist that no depreciation charge whatsoever shall be made. \n48\n\u00a0\n\n To use a depreciation charge as the measure of the year's consumption of plant, and at the same time reject original cost as the basis of the charge, is inadmissible. \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 278]\n\u00a0\n It is a perversion of this business device. No method for the ascertainment of the amount of the charge yet invented is workable if fluctuating present values be taken as the basis. Every known method contemplates, and is dependent upon, the accumulation or credit of a fixed amount in a given number of years. The distribution of plant expense expressed in the depreciation charge is justified by the approximation to the fact as to the year's plant consumption which is obtained by applying the doctrine of averages. But if fluctuating present values are substituted for original cost there is no stable base to which the process of averaging can be applied. For thereby the only stable factor involved in fixing a depreciation charge would be eliminated. Each year the present value may be different. The cost of replacement at the termination of the service life of the several units or of the composite life cannot be foretold. \n49\n To use as a measure of the year's consumption of plant a depreciation charged based on fluctuating present values substitutes conjecture for experience. Such a system would require the consumer of to- day to pay for an assumed operating expense which has never been incurred and which may never arise.\n The depreciation charge is frequently likened to the annual premium in legal reserve life insurance. The life \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 279]\n\u00a0\n insurance premium is calculated on an agreed value of the human life- comparable to the known cost of plant-not on a fluctuating value, unknown and unknowable. The field of life insurance presented a problem comparable to that here involved. Despite the large experience embodied in the standard mortality tables and the relative simplicity of the problem there presented, the actual mortality was found to vary so widely from that for which the premiums had provided, that their rate was found to work serious injustice either to the insurer or to the insured. The transaction resulted sometimes in bankruptcy of the insurer; sometimes in his securing profits which were extortionate; and rarely, in his receiving only the intended fair compensation for the service rendered. Because every attempt to approximate more nearly the amount of premium required proved futile, justice was sought and found in the system of strictly mutual insurance. Under that system the premium charged is made clearly ample; and the part which proves not to have been needed enures in some form of benefit to him who paid it.\n Similarly, if, instead of applying the rule of Smyth v. Ames, the rate base of a utility were fixed at the amount prudently invested, the inevitable errors incident to estimating service life and net expense in plant consumption could never result in injustice either to the utility or to the community. For, if the amount set aside for depreciation proved inadequate and investment of new capital became necessary, the utility would be permitted to earn a return on the new capital. And if the amount set aside for depreciation proved to be excessive, the income from the surplus reserve would operate as a credit to reduce the capital charge which the rates must earn. If the Railways should ever suffer injustice from adopting cost of plant as the basis for calculating the depreciation charge, it will be an unavoidable incident of applying in valuation the rule of Smyth v. Ames. This risk, if it \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 280]\n\u00a0\n exists, cannot be escaped by basing the charge on present value. For this suggested escape, besides being entirely conjectural, is instinct with certainty of injustice either to the community or the Railways. The possibility of such injustice admonishes us, as it did in deciding the constitutional questions concerning interstate commerce, Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, \n278 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 49 S. Ct. 1; Federal Trade Comm. v. Pacfic Paper Ass'n, \n273 \nU.S. 52, 64\n, 47 S. Ct. 255; and taxation, Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219, 237\n, 37 S. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642; Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 55\n, 40 S. Ct. 221; Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota (No. 26) \n280 \nU.S. 204\n, 50 S. Ct. 98, decided this day, that rate regulation is an intensely practical matter.\n Fifth. Public officials, investors and most large businesses are convinced of the practical value of the depreciation charge as a guide to knowledge of the results of operation. Many States require public utilities to make such a charge. \n50\n But most railroads, some gas and electric \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 281]\n\u00a0\n companies and some other concerns, deny the propriety of making any annual depreciation charge. 51 They insist that the making of such a charge will serve rather to mislead that to aid in determining the financial result of the year's operations. They urge that the current cost of maintaining the plant, whether by repair, renewals or replacements, should be treated as a part of the maintenance account, at least in systems consisting of large and diversified properties intended for continuous operation and requiring a constant level of efficiency. They insist that, in such systems, retirements, replacements and renewals attain a uniform rate and tend to be equal each year; that, therefore, no great disproportion in revenues and operating expenses in the various years results if the whole expenditure made for renewals or replacements in any year is treated as an expense of operation of that year and the retirements of property are not otherwise reflected in any specific charge. They admit that it may be desirable to create a special reserve, to enable the company to spread the cost of retiring certain large units of property over a series of years, thus preventing a disproportionate burden upon the operations of a single year. But they say that such a reserve is not properly called a depreciation reserve. Moreover they contend that when a large unit is retired, not because it has been worn out but because some more efficient substitute has been found, the cost of retire- \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 282]\n\u00a0\n ment should be spread over the future, so that it may fall upon those who will gain the benefit of the enhanced efficiency. Compare Kansas City Southern Ry. v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 423, 440\n, 441 S., 34 S. Ct. 125, 52 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1. Under the replacement method of accounting advocated by the railroads and others there is no depreciation charge and no depreciation reserve. Operating expenses are charged directly with replacements at their cost. This method does not concern itself with all retirements, but only with retirements which are replaced. \n 52\n\u00a0\n\n Despite the seemingly unanswerable logic of a depreciation charge, they oppose its adoption, urging the uncertainties inherent in the predetermination of service life and of salvage value, and the disagreement among experts as to the most equitable plan of distributing the total net plant expense among the several years of service. They point out that each step in the process of fixing a depreciation charge is beset with difficulties, because of the variables which attend every determination involved. The first step is to estimate how long the depreciable plant will remain in service. Engineers calculate with certitude its composite service life by ap- \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 283]\n\u00a0\n plying weighted averages to the data concerning the several property units. But their exactitude is delusive. Each unit has its individual life dependent upon the effect of physical exhaustion, obsolescence, inadequacy and public requirement. 53 The physical duration of the life depends largely upon the conditions of the use; and these cannot be foretold. The process of obsolescence is even less predictable. Advances in the arts are constantly being made which would require retirement at some time, even if the unit were endowed with perpetual physical life. But these advances do not proceed at a uniform pace. The normal progress of invention is stimulated or retarded by the ever changing conditions \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 284]\n\u00a0\n of business. Moreover, it is the practical embodiment of inventions which produces obsolescence; and business conditions determine even more largely the time and the extent to which new inventions are embodied in improved machines. The march toward inadequacy, as distinguished from obsolescence, is likewise erratic.\n The protestants point out that uncertainty is incident also to the second step in the process of fixing the appropriate depreciation charge. A plant unit rarely remains in service until consumed physically. Scrap remains; and this must be accounted for, since it is the net expense of the exhaustion of plant which the depreciation charge is to cover. Such scrap value is often a very large factor in the calculation of plant expense. \n54\n The probable salvage on the unit when retired at the end of its service life must, therefore, be estimated. But its future value is never knowable.\n And, finally, the protestants show that after the net expense in plant consumption is thus estimated, there remains the task of distributing it equitably over the assumed service life-the allocation of the amount as charges of the several years. There are many recognized methods for calculating these amounts, each method having strenuous advocates; and the amounts thus to be charged, in the aggregate as well as in the successive years, differ widely according to the method adopted. \n55\n Under the straight line method, the aggregate of the charges of the several years equals the net plant expense for the whole period of service life; and the charge is the \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 285]\n\u00a0\n same for all the years. Under the sinking fund method, the aggregate of the charges of the several years is less than the net plant expense for the whole period; because the proceeds of each year's charge are deemed to have been continuously invested at compound interest and the balance is assumed to be obtained from interest accumulations. Other methods of distributing the total charge produce still other results in the amount of the charges laid upon the operating expense of the several years of service. \n56\n\u00a0\n\n We have no occasion to decide now whether the view taken by the Interstate Commerce Commission in Telephone and Railroad Depreciation Charges, 118 I. C. C. 295, or the protest of the railroads, gas and electric com- \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 286]\n\u00a0\n panies should prevail. \n57\n For in neither event was the Court of Appeals justified in directing an increase in the allowance. The adequacy of a depreciation charge is dependent in large measure upon the practice of the individual concern with respect to its maintenance account. The Commission found that the Railways' property was well maintained and that the allowance of $883,544, together with the usual maintenance charges, would be adequate to keep the property at a constant level of efficiency. It found further, on the basis of the Company's experience, that the charges previously allowed had served 'fairly well' to take care of current depreciation and retirements. The depreciation charge was established by the Railways in 1912 and was fixed by it, of its own motion, at 5 per cent. of the gross revenues. The charge at that rate had been continued ever since and had yielded each year an increasing sum. For the gross revenues had grown steadily. In the early years, they grew through increase of the number of passengers carried; since 1919, through the repeated increases in the rate of fare. In nearly every year, the allowance had exceeded the charges for retirements. After charging retirements, \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 287]\n\u00a0\n whether replaced or not, to the reserve, there remained a credit, on August 31, 1927, of $1,413,793. The allowance of $883,544 is equal to 5 per cent. of the estimated gross revenues for 1928. The increase of this allowance for 1928 over that for 1914 was greater proportionately than the increase of the 1928 value of the Railways' property over its 1914 value. \n 58\n\u00a0\n\n The estimated charge of $883,544 was thus clearly ample as the year's share of the expense of plant retirement based on cost. But even if the annual depreciation allowance could be made to correspond with the actual consumption of plant, there was nothing in the record to show that the value of the part of plant to be consumed in 1928 would exceed that amount. Nor is there anything in the record or in the findings to show that $883, 544, together with the usual maintenance charges and under the improved methods of construction, would be inadequate to provide, at the prices then prevailing, for the replacements required in that year, and also for the year's contribution to a special reserve under the plan advocated by the railroads before the Interstate Commerce Commission. On the contrary, the company's history59 and the present advances in the street railway industry strongly indicate that, by employing new equipment of lesser value,60 the Railways could render more efficient service at smaller operating costs. Neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals made any finding on these matters. The Commission's finding that \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 288]\n\u00a0\n $883,544 was an adequate depreciation charge should, therefore, have been accepted by the Court of Appeals, whether the sum allowed be deemed a depreciation charge properly so called, or be treated as the year's contribution to a special reserve to supplement the usual maintenance charges.\n It is clear that the management of the Railways deemed the charge of 5 per cent. of gross revenues adequate. On that assumption it paid dividends on the common stock in each year from 1923 through 1927.61 If the addition to the depreciation charge ordered by the Court of Appeals was proper for the year 1928, it should have also been made in the preceding five years. \n62\n Upon such a recasting of the accounts, no profits were earned after 1924; and there was no surplus fund from which dividends could have been paid legally. If the contention now urged by the Railways is sound, the management misrepresented by its published accounts its financial condition and the results of operation of the several years; and it paid dividends in violation of law. \n63\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES joins in this opinion. \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 289]\n\u00a0\n\n Opinion of Mr. Justice STONE.\n I agree with what Mr. Justice BRANDEIS has said, both as to the propriety of excluding from the rate base the value of the franchise or easement donated to the railway company and with respect to the method of ascertaining depreciation. But of this I would say a further word.\n I will assume, for present purposes, that as a result of Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466\n, 18 S. Ct. 418, the function of a depreciation account for rate making purposes must be taken to be the establishment of a fund for the replacement of plant rather than the restoration of cost or value of the original plant investment. But what amount annually carried to reserve will be sufficient to replace all the elements of a composite property purchased at various times, at varying price levels, as they were out or become obsolete, is a question, not of law but of fact. It is a question which must be answered on the basis of a prediction of the salvage value of the obsolete elements, the character of the articles which will be selected to replace them when replacement is necessary, and their cost at the time of replacement.\n Obviously, that question cannot be answered by a priori reasoning. Experience is our only guide, tempered by the consideration of such special or unusual facts and circumstances as would tend to modify the results of experience. Experience, which embraces the past fifteen years of high price levels, and the studies of experts, resulting in the universally accepted practice of account- \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 290]\n\u00a0\n ants and business economists, as recounted in detail by Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, have demonstrated that depreciation reserve, calculated on the basis of cost, has proven to be the most trustworthy guide in determining the amount required to replace, at the end of their useful life, the constantly shifting elements of a property such as the present. Costs of renewals made during the present prolonged period of high prices and diminishing replacement costs tend to offset the higher cost of replacing articles purchased in periods of lower prices. I think that we should be guided by that experience and practice in the absence of proof of any special circumstances showing that they are inapplicable to the particular situation with which we are now concerned.\n Such proof, in the present case, is wanting. The only circumstance relied on for a different basis of depreciation, and one which is embraced in that experience, is the current high price level, which has raised the present reproduction value of the carrier's property, as a whole, above its cost. That, of course, might be a controlling consideration if we were dealing with present replacements or their present cost, instead of replacements to be made at various uncertain dates in the future, of articles purchased at different times in the past, at varying price levels. But I cannot say that since prices at the present moment are high, as a result of post-war inflation, a rate of return which is sufficient to yield 7.78 per cent. on present reproduction value, after adequate depreciation based on cost of the carrier's property, is confiscatory because logic requires the prediction that the elements of petitioner's property cannot, in years to come, be renewed or replaced with adequate substitutes, at less than the present average reproduction cost of the entire property-and this in the face of the facts that the cost of replacements in the past 15 years has been for the most part at higher price levels that at present, that \n\n[280 U.S. 234, 291]\n\u00a0\n the amount allowed by the Commission for depreciation has been in practice more than sufficient for all replacement requirements throughout the period of higher price levels, and that the company has declared and paid dividends which were earned only if this depreciation reserve was adequate.\n To say that the present price level is necessarily the true measure of future replacement cost is to substitute for a relevant fact which I should have thought ought to be established as are other facts, a rule of law which seems not to follow from Smyth v. Ames, and to be founded neither upon experience nor expert opinion and to be unworkable in practice. In the present case it can be applied only by disregarding evidence which would seem persuasively to establish the very fact to be ascertained. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] See, for example, Galveston Elec.

Then it applied for authority to increase its fares 'purely as a war emergency and during the period of war conditions.' Six increases have since been granted: To 6 cents on January 7, 1919, In re United Rys. & Elec. Co., P. U. R. 1919C, 74; to 7 cents cash, four tokens for 26 cents, on September 30, 1919, In re United Rys. & Elec. Co., P. U. R. 1920A, 1; to a flat 7 cents on December 31, 1919; In re United Rys. & Elec. Co., P. U. R 1920A, 995; to 8 cents, two tokens for 15 cents, on May 26, 1924, In re United Rys. & Elec. Co., P. U. R. 1924D, 713. This was the rate of fare when on August, 1, 1927, the Railways filed with the Commission the 1919, In re United Rys. & Elec. Co., P. U. R. 1920A, original decision thereon the Commission authorized a fare of 9 cents cash, three tokens for 25 cents, In re United Rys. & Elec. Co., P. U. R. 1928C, 604. To provide the additional revenue required by the decision of the Court of Appeals concerning depreciation, the Commission then raised the fare to 10 cents cash, four tokens for 35 cents, In re United Rys. & Elec. Co., P. U. R. 1929A, 180. The Railways is still seeking to secure a flat 10-cent fare. The Railways had by order of the Commission been protected from jitney competition. See P. U.

The yearly charge is by many concerns allocated in monthly instalments. A depreciation reserve is a bookkeeping classification to which the depreciation charges are periodically credited. A depreciation fund is a fund separately maintained in which amounts charged for depreciation are periodically deposited. A depreciation reserve does not necessarily connote the existence of a separate fund. E. A. Saliers, Depreciation, Principles and Applications (1923) 80; W. A. Paton and R. A. Stevenson, Principles of Accounting (1918) 491-505. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] If the depreciation charge measured the actual consumption of plant, the logic of this conclusion might seem forceful. It should be pointed out, therefore, that, apart from the fact developed in the text, that the charge does not measure the actual consumption of plant, the contention is specious. A business man investing in a long-lived plant does not expect to have its value returned to him in instalments corresponding to the loss of service life. The most that a continuing business like a street railway may expect is that, at the end of the service life, it shall be reimbursed with the then value of the original investment, or with funds sufficient to replace the plant. As will be shown presently, there is no basis for assuming that either the value of the original investment or the replacement cost will, at the end of the service life, equal or approximate the present value. See note 49, infra. \n[\nFootnote 13\n] 'Depreciation of physical units used in connection with public utilities, or, indeed, with any other industries, does not proceed in accordance with any mathematical law. ... There is no regularity in the development of the increasing need for repairs; there is no regularity in the progress of depreciation; but, in order to devise a reasonable plan for laying aside allowances from year to year to make good the depreciation as it accrues, and to provide for the accumulation of a sum equivalent to the cost less salvage of a unit by the time it is retired, some theory of depreciation progress must be assumed on which such allowances may be based.' 81 Am. Soc. of Civil Eng. Transactions (1917), 1311, 1462, 1463. Compare E. A. Saliers, op. cit., note 11, at p. 132. \n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] 'In our valuation work they (the railroad companies) have consistently taken the position that no depreciation exists in a railroad property which is maintained in 100 per cent. efficiency.' Proposed Report of Interstate Commerce Commission on Telephone and Railroad Depreciation Charges, Docket Nos. 14700 and 15100, August 15, 1929, p. 20. \n[\nFootnote 15\n] Some contend 'that where accruing depreciation is dependent, not upon lapse of time, but upon amount and extent of use, it is unscientific to provide for depreciation charges in equal annual installments, and that these charges should be made to correspond with units of use rather than of time. By relating the charges to units of use, they contend that the burden of the charges will be spread more equitably, to the financial advantage of the carrier, over alternating periods of light and heavy traffic.' Proposed Report of the Interstate Commerce Commission, note 14, supra, p. 15. The practices of street railways differ in respect to the manner of laying the year's contribution to the depreciation reserve. Some lay a fixed percentage upon the gross revenues; some, a number of cents per car mile; some, a fixed percentage on the cost of the depreciable plant. Though expressed in different terms, the amount contemplated to be charged may in fact be based on cost. See, e. g., In re Elizabethtown Water Co., P. U. R. 1927E, 39. \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] See testimony on rehearing of Telephone and Railroad Depreciation Charges, note 10, supra, A. B. Crunden, March 21, 1928 (printed by American Tel. & Tel.

Since this objection is common to all methods, other considerations will probably lead to a choice.' \n[\nFootnote 20\n] The first case in which this court expressly recognized a depreciation allowance as a part of operating expenses is Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., \n212 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 29 S. Ct. 148, decided in 1909. In earlier cases cognizance was not taken of it. Compare Union Pacific R. R. Co. v.

Others followed in 1905. 31 Street Ry. Journal 169, 170, 687, 688. In England, the adoption of the depreciation charge had been hastened by a provision in the income tax law. Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1878, 41 Vict. c. 15 ,  12. Massachusetts Acts 1849, c. 191, provided that the annual report required of railroads should give full information on 'estimated depreciation beyond the renewals, viz. road and bridges, buildings, engines and cars.' See, also, Acts 1846, c. 251. But in Massachusetts, as elsewhere in the United States, depreciation charges have not been customary among railroads, except in respect to equipment, pursuant to the rule prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1907. \n[\nFootnote 21\n] See Telephone and Railroad Depreciation Charges, 118 I.

It does not represent an accumulation for the purpose of acquiring assets in the future. (2) The replacement cost theory is impractical because it would require a constant revaluation of assets. It is, furthermore, unlikely that any manufacturer would rebuild the same plant ten years after its construction. (3) The depreciation charge absorbed in the cost of the product represents a charge for the use of present manufacturing facilities and cannot have any connection with assets to be acquired in the future. The depreciation charge on new and more efficient equipment to be acquired in the future may be higher and, perhaps, offset by a general reduction in manufacturing cost per unit. It is not logical to base all other cost elements on present expenses and make the one exception in the case of depreciation.'

Depreciation is a reserve to equalize retirements and not a reserve to equalize replacements. A rate of depreciation based upon original cost, even, is little more than an intelligent guess; but based upon reproduction costs is the blindest kind of speculation. With the known original cost of a unit and an engineer's estimate of its service life and salvage value, ... some semblance of accuracy might be reached. To guess its service life and salvage value is bad enough but who would venture to guess what it would cost to reproduce it ten or twenty years thereafter. ... Depreciation reserve is intended to keep the investment level but not to insure the hazards of varying future.'\n In its second report in the instant case the Commission said: 'The plan of providing for retirements at cost is that followed by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the utility regulatory commissions of most of the states, and by all other utilities under the jurisdiction of this Commission.'

But it is always a stable one. Original cost, as used in this opinion includes other such stable bases.

The Superme Court did not mention this question in its opinion. \n[\nFootnote 46\n] The Michigan Supreme Court made a statement similar to that of the special commissioner in the Kansas case, but did not disturb the finding of the Commission. The court made no reference to the insurmountable practical difficulties presented. \n\n[\nFootnote 47\n] Telephone and Railroad Depreciation Charges, 118 I. C.

See their brief submitted on original argument, page 48: 'The amount of the depreciation expense is the cost of the property used up; that is, it is the dollars consumed. Therefore it is the cost less the salvage realized at retirement.'

C. C. 295, 344, the Commission said: 'It is agreed by all that depreciation expense should be based primarily upon the original cost to the accounting company of the unit of property in question.' In the petition for rehearing filed by the Presidents' Conference Committee on Valuation, however, it was stated, page 15: 'Consideration should be given to the question of whether accounting depreciation, as the order conceives it, should be estimated upon the basis of original cost or of present value. ...' A similar statement is made for the first time in the petition for rehearing filed by the New York Central lines, at page 5. \n\n[\nFootnote 49\n] In part, costs and values in the several future years will depend upon the general price level. As to this even the economist can know nothing, save how the general price level has heretofore fluctuated from year to year; and that periods of rising prices have ever been followed by periods of falling prices. But cost and value in the several future years will depend in part upon factors other than the general price level. Even if the general price level for every future year were known, it would still be impossible to predict with reasonable accuracy the then cost or value of a unit then to be replaced, renewed or retired. For despite a higher general price level, the part might be procurable at smaller costs, by reason of economies introduced in its manufacture and changes in the methods and means of performing the work.

In Maryland, the Commission's power over accounting methods is held to include the power to require depreciation accounting, but not the maintaining of a separate fund. See Havre De Grace Bridge Co. v. Public Service Comm., 132 Md. 16, 103 A. 319. \n\n[\nFootnote 51\n] See note 21, supra; G. O. May, Carrier Property Consumed in Operation and the Regulation of Profits, 43 Q. J. Ec. 208-14; R. A. Carter and W. L. Ransom, Depreciation Charges of Railroads and Public Utilities, a memorandum filed with the depreciation section of the Bureau of Accounts of the Interstate Commerce Commission (1921). \n\n[\nFootnote 52\n] A modification of the depreciation reserve method is the 'retirement reserve' recommended by the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners. This reserve does not involve necessary periodic charges of specific amounts to operating expenses. To this reserve are credited 'such amounts as are charged to the operating expense account ... appropriated from surplus, or both, to cover the retirement loss represented by the excess of the original cost plus cost of dismantling, over the salvage value of fixed capital retired from service.' To the operating expense, 'Retirement Expense' are charged 'amounts ... in addition to amounts appropriated from surplus, to provide a reserve against which may be charged the original cost of all property retired from service, plus cost of dismantling, less salvage.'

Conv. 1920, Appendix 1, pp. 21, 76, 106 Appendix 2, pp. 21, 88. \n\n[\nFootnote 53\n] The adequacy of a depreciation charge depends, among other things, upon the liberality of the particular concern's practice in respect to maintenance, 81 Amer. Soc. Civil Eng. Transactions (1917) 1490; R. H. Montgomery, Auditing Theory and Practice (1921) vol. 1, p. 625. It depends in part upon the scope of the causes of retirement to be covered by it. As to what is the proper scope, opinion differs widely. The telephone companies (Bell System) contend that the charge should cover all causes of retirement not provided for by ordinary maintenance charges, including cluding extraordinary casualties like storm and fire. 118 I. C. C. 340. Others insist that the charge should not include any allowance for contingent or presently unascertainable obsolescence, inadequacy, changes in the art, public requirements, storm casualties, or extraordinary repairs or expense of similar character. 118 I. C. C. 341. Still others insist that the charge should cover only exhaustion due to wear and tear and lapse of time collectively called superannuation, but not obsolescence, inadequacy and the like, which are said to be precipitate in their operation. The Proposed Report of the Interstate Commerce Commission on Telephone and Railroad Depreciation Charges, Docket Nos. 14700 and 15100, August 15, 1929, pp. 27, 28, defines depreciation as 'the loss in service value not restored by current maintenance and incurred in connection with the consumption or prospective retirement of property in the course of service from causes against which the carrier is not protected by insurance, which are known to be in current operation, and whose effect can be forecast with a reasonable approach to accuracy.' \n\n[\nFootnote 54\n] In the case of telephone companies the value of the salvage recovered runs as high as 45 per cent. of the original cost of the property. Testimony of Dr. M. R. Maltbie, note 16, supra, pp. 1459, 1460. \n[\nFootnote 55\n] Thus, if a unit costs $100, has a service life of 25 years and no salvage value, and the rate of interest is 5 per cent., the charge to \n operating expenses for depreciation in each of the following years would be:\n Under Under Under Fixed Straight Sinking Percentage of Under Line Fund Diminishing Annuity Method.

Civil Eng. Transactions (1917) 1463-1484. \n\n[\nFootnote 57\n] Nor need we express an opinion on the relation between a utility's depreciation reserve and the valuation of the accrued depreciation of its property. See Proposed Report of the Interstate Commerce Commission, note 14, supra, at pp. 20-24. While it is true that the annual depreciation charge does not purport to measure the current actual consumption of plant, it may be that the credit balance in the depreciation reserve is good evidence of the amount of accrued depreciation. See New York Telephone Co. v. Prendergast (District Court, S. D. N. Y.) 36 F.(2d) 54, decided November 7, 1929. It may also be that so much of the depreciation reserve as has not been used for retirements or replacements should be subtracted from the present value of the utility's property in determining the rate base, on the theory that the amounts thus contributed by the public represent a part payment for the property consumed or to be consumed in service. Compare Burns' Ann. Ind. Stat. (1926) vol. 3,  12693-12696, p. 1245. These matters are not involved in the case at bar and as to them no opinion is expressed. \n\n[\nFootnote 58\n] In determining the reproduction cost of the Company's deprociable property, the Commission applied an index figure of 1.54 to the 1914 value. P. U. R. 1926C, 441, 464. If the depreciation charge for 1914, $469,395, is multiplied by the same index figure, the product is $160,676 less than the allowance originally made for 1928. The additions to plant since 1914, $ 7,500,000, required a proportional increase in the depreciation charge of only $145,500. \n[\nFootnote 59\n] See In re United Rys. & Elec. Co., P. U. R. 1928C, 604, 633, 634. \n[\nFootnote 60\n] See 73 Electric Ry. Journal (1929) 693, 705, 758, 831, 843. \n\n[\nFootnote 61\n] The company was not, of course, restricted to a depreciation charge of 5 per cent. of gross revenues. That was only the amount which the Commission deemed adequate. But the company was free to reserve a greater amount, without paying dividends, if it believed a greater amount was necessary. Cf. Havre De Grace Bridge Co. v. Public Service Comm., 132 Md. 16, 103 A. 319. \n[\nFootnote 62\n] The value of the depreciable property in each of the five years preceding 1928 was almost constant and at least equal to that in 1928. P. U. R. 1928C, 604, 639; P. U. R. 1929A, 180, 183. \n[\nFootnote 63\n] In each of those years annual dividends amounting to $818,448 were paid. The recorded surplus at the beginning of 1923 was.$1,553,097.83. If the depreciation allowance contended for had been made in each of those years, this surplus would have been wiped out in 1925 and there would have remained a deficit, after payment of dividends of $416,568 in 1925, $1,027, 837 in 1926, and $2,140,146 in 1927. Instead, the Railways reported a surplus of $2,005,473 at the end of 1925, $2,020,863 at the end of 1926 and $1,588,823 at the end of 1927. See Moody's Manual of Investments ( Public Utilities) 1929, pp. 375, 376; Poor's Public Utility Section 1929, p. 968. In declaring these dividends, the managemet did not overlook the necessity of adequate provision for depreciation. For, in the several rate cases before the Commission it had insisted that the depreciation allowances were inadequate. \n\n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES FIDELITY & GUARANTY CO. v. GUENTHER(1930)\nNo. 179\nArgued: January 23, 1930Decided: February 24, 1930\n\n\n\n Mr. C. M. Horn, of Cleveland, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Mr. William M. Byrnes, of Cleveland, Ohio, for respondent. \n\n[281 U.S. 34, 35]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In February, 1925, the Fidelity & Guaranty Co. issued to Guenther, a resident of Cleveland, Ohio, an automobile insurance policy, insuring him against loss and expense arising from claims upon him for damages in consequence of any accident occurring within the United States or Canada by reason of the use of his automobile and resulting in bodily injuries to another person. The policy provided that it was subject to the express condition that it 'shall not cover any liability of the assured while (the automobile is) being operated by any person under the age limit fixed by law or under the age of sixteen years in any event.'\n In May, while the policy was in force, the automobile was being operated, with Guenther's consent and premission, by a minor seventeen years of age upon the highways and streets of the city of Lakewood, Ohio, and collided with an inflicted personal injuries upon a third person. At that time there was in force in the city of Lakewood an ordinance which made it 'unlawful for any owner, bailee, lessee or custodian of any motor vehicle to permit a minor under the age of 18 years to operate or run said motor vehicle upon public highways, streets or alleys in said City of Lakewood.' No statute of the State of Ohio made unlawful the operation of an automobile by minors over sixteen years of age.\n The injured person sued Guenther, and recovered judgment. Guenther, having paid this judgment, brought an action against the Company on the insurance policy to recover the loss and expense incurred by him in the personal injury suit. This was removed to the Federal District Court for northern Ohio, where Guenther recovered judgment, which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 31 F.(2d) 919. \n\n[281 U.S. 34, 36]\n\u00a0\n The sole question presented here is whether, under the terms of the policy, liability of the Company was excluded by reason of the municipal ordinance.\n\n 1. \nWe think that within the plain meaning of the policy the operator of the automobile was 'under the age limit fixed' by the ordinance. Ture it is that the ordinance does not fix a general age limit for operators of automobiles. but as the ordinance makes it unlawful for the owner of an automobile to permit a minor under eighteen years of age to operate it, to say that when the owner permits a minor only seventeen years of age to operate it the operator is not 'under the age limit fixed' by the ordinance, would be merely sticking in the bark.\n\n 2. \nThe fact that a State statute prohibits the employment of a child under sixteen years of age to operate an automobile1 does not affect the validity of the city ordinance. Municipal corporations in Ohio are given 'special power to regulate the use of the streets, to be exercised in the manner provided by law,' and 'the care, supervision and control of public highways, streets,' etc. 2 Plainly, the general statute which merely forbids the employment of minors under sixteen teen years to operate automobiles, does not prevent the city, in the exercise of its delegated power to regulate the use of its streets, from prohibiting the operation of automobiles by minors under eighteen years of age. Such a regulation merely supplements locally the provision of the general statute and is not in conflict with it. Thus in Heidle v. Baldwin, 118 Ohio St. 375, 385, 161 N. E. 44, 58 A. L. R. 1186, the court held that a minicipality had the power to adopt regulations as to the use of its streets in addition to those imposed by a state statute, and sustained an ordinance imposing a more onerous obligation upon drivers at intersecting streets than that imposed by the statute. \n\n[281 U.S. 34, 37]\n\u00a0\n 3. This brings use to the question whether the age limit fixed by the municipal ordinance is one 'fixed by law' within the meaning of the policy.\n In Imperial Fire Insurance Co. v. Coos County, \n151 \nU.S. 452, 462\n, 14 S. Ct. 379, 381, this court said: 'It is settled ... that, when an insurance contract is so drawn as to be ambiguous, or to require interpretation, or to be fairly susceptible of two different constructions, so that reasonably intelligent men, on reading the contract, would honestly differ as to the meaning thereof, that construction will be adopted which is most favorable to the insured. But the rule is equally well settled that contracts of insurance, like other contracts are to be construed according to the sense and meaning of the terms which the parties have used, and, if they are clear and unambiguous, their terms are to be taken and understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.'\n Applying that rule here, we think that when the words of the exclusion clause are taken in their ordinary meaning they are free from any ambiguity that requires them to be construed most strongly against the Company. The plain and evident purpose of the clause was to prevent the Company from being held liable for any accident occurring while by reason of the age of the operator the automobile was being operated in violation of law. To that end liability was excluded when the operator was under 'the age limit fixed by law.' This is not limited to the case where the age limit is fixed by 'a law,' a specific phrase frequently limited in a technical sense to a statute, which, to say the least, would have involved doubt as to whether a municipal ordinance was included. On the contrary the clause uses the broad phrase 'fixed by law,' in which the term 'law' is used in a generic sense, as meaning the rules of action or conduct duly prescribed by controlling authority, and having binding legal force; including valid municipal ordinance as well as statutes. Thus in \n\n[281 U.S. 34, 38]\n\u00a0\n the Matter of Mutual Life Insurance Co., 89 N. Y. 530, 531, 533, the court held that a street grade fixed and established by an ordinance of the city council, duly authorized thereto, was one 'fixed and established by law.'\n We find no ambiguity in the phrase 'under the age limit fixed by law' contained in the exclusion clause of the policy; and think that by reason of the ordinance, liability on the part of the Company is precluded.\n The judgment is\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Throckmorton's Annotated Code of Ohio,  13002. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Throckmorton's Annotated Code of Ohio,  3714. \n\n\n\n\n","132":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES SHIPPING BOARD MERCHANT FLEET CORPORATION V.(1930)\nNo. 345\nArgued: April 16, 1930Decided: May 19, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 519, 520]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Claude R.

Ed. -, to review a ruling of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that the Fleet Corporation is subject to suit upon a contract which it entered into, acting as an agency of the United States under the Urgent Deficiencies Act of June 15, 1917 (40 Stat. 182) as amended.\n On June 15, 1917, the Fleet Corporation contracted with Groton Iron Works for the construction of twelve wooden ships, reduced to eight by contract of September 30, 1918. On August 11, 1917, and April 20, 1918, contracts were executed, each for the construction of six steel ships. After the Armistice the Fleet Corporation gave directions to suspend work on a part of the steel ships. The Iron Works became financially involved and, the Fleet Corporation having advanced large sums to it, negotiation for a settlement of various differences between the two corporations resulted in the contract between it and the Fleet Corporation of March 26, 1920. This \n\n[281 U.S. 519, 523]\n\u00a0\n described the Fleet Corporation as 'representing and acting ... for and in behalf of the United States of America (hereinafter referred to as the owner).' It canceled the earlier contracts, with some exceptions relating to the completion of the steel ships, and settled and released numerous other claims not now important, saving certain claims growing out of a reconciliation of accounts, then in progress, to determine the amount due for certain work on the wooden ships.\n The Iron Works, before its bankruptcy, brought the present suit in the superior court of Connecticut, which was removed to the District Court for Connecticut, where, respondent, the trustee in bankruptcy, having intervened, the complaint was reframed so as to pray the cancellation of the contract of March 26, 1920, as procured by duress and fraud, an accounting and judgment for such amounts as should be found to be due for breach of the earlier contracts. A fourth separate defense, which alone is presently involved, set up that with respect to all the transactions alleged in the bill of complaint, petitioner acted solely as an agency of the United States, under powers delegated to it by the President under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, and that with respect to those transactions it was under no personal liability and respondent's only remedy was against the United States.\n The District Court confirmed findings of a special master, in favor of petitioner, on the issues of fraud and duress and his conclusion that the rights of the parties were fixed by the contract of March 26, 1920, but gave judgment, sustaining the fourth defense and dismissing the complaint. Harwood v. United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corp., 26 F.(2d) 116. The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment, holding that the suit might be maintained against the petitioner, but limited the relief to an accounting under the contract of March 26, 1920. 32 F.(2d) 680. \n\n[281 U.S. 519, 524]\n\u00a0\n Concededly, as both courts below and the special master agree, in entering into the several contracts referred to, the Fleet Corporation was acting as an agency of the United States as alleged. But all of the contracts were signed and sealed by the Fleet Corporation, which was referred to as a corporation organized under the laws of the District of Columbia and which promised to pay the stipulated price for the ships and to perform the other obligations of the contracts, in terms imposed on it. They contained no words purporting to bind the United States or in terms restricting the liability of the petitioner.\n One acting as a private agent may be bound, notwithstanding his known agency, upon contracts which he executes in his own name.

Ct. 198. \n\n[281 U.S. 519, 525]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner contends that there is a strong presumption, which is here controlling, that a public officer or agent is not to be deemed bound as an individual upon his contracts made in behalf of the government in the performance of a public duty, since no one participating in such a contract would be justified in assuming, in the absence of a clearly expressed intention otherwise, that the officer intends to bind himself to defray public expense from his private purse. Parks v. Ross, 11 How. 362; Hodgson v. Dexter Co., 1 Cranch, 345; Sheets v. Selden's Lessee, 2 Wall. 177. See District of Columbia v. Camden Iron Works, \n181 \nU.S. 453, 459\n, 21 S. Ct. 680.\n But we need not decide the point or attempt to draw the line where that presumption may be overcome by language of the written contract which falls short of an explicit limitation of the personal liability of the agent. See Hodgson v. Dexter, supra, page 364 of 1 Cranch. For in the present case the agent is not an individual and its liability does not involve any expenditure of private funds for the satifaction of public obligations. Its entire capital stock is government owned. Its funds and property were furnished to it by the government. They and government indemnity are alone the sources from which its obligations will be defrayed.\n It was created as a government agency to construct a fleet of vessels to meet a wartime emergency. It was in order better to fulfill that purpose that Congress chose an instrument having the power to contract, as well as all the other powers of a private corporation, but with its every action government controlled and all its assets supplied from government sources. The advantages of resorting to such powers in meeting the national emergency were urged as grounds for the choice of this particular form of agency, when the Urgent Deficiency bill was pending in Congress. See remarks of Senator Underwood, reporting the bill for the Senate Conferees, 55 \n\n[281 U.S. 519, 526]\n\u00a0\n Cong. Rec. 65th Cong., p. 3549; see The Lake Monroe, supra, page 254 of 250 U. S., 39 S. Ct. 460; Skinner & Eddy Corporation v. McCarl, supra, page 8 of 275 U. S., 48 S. Ct. 12. There is thus no basis for presuming that the Fleet Corporation is not to be deemed bound by the contracts into which it enters merely because it is acting as such an agency, and its liability as measured by their terms is not to be curtailed by the presumption which, it is urged, may be indulged in favor of an individual acting for the government.\n That is the effect of the decision in Astoria Marine Iron Works v. United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, \n258 \nU.S. 549, 569\n, 42 S. Ct. 386. It was there held that suit might be maintained against the Fleet Corporation in a District Court upon a contract in form and in manner of execution like those presently involved and where as here the Fleet Corporation was described in the contract as 'representing the United States of America.' It is true, as the petitioner argues, that the precise question at issue was one of jurisdiction of the District Court to entertain the suit rather than the Court of Claims, as one against the government. But the jurisdiction was sustained on the ground that the Fleet Corporation was bound by its contract, even though it acted as an agency of the United States and so was subject to the suit upon it in the District Court. The court said (page 569 of 258 U. S., 42 S. Ct. 386, 389): 'The whole frame of the instrument (the contract) seems to us plainly to recognize the Corporation as the immediate party to the contract. ... If we are right in this, further reasoning seems to us unnecessary to show that there was jurisdiction of the suit. The fact that the corporation was formed under the general laws of the District of Columbia is persuasive even standing alone, that it was expected to contract and to stand suit in its own person, whatever indemnities might be furnished by the United States.' See United States v. Wood (C. C. A.) 290 F. 115, Id., \n263 \nU.S. 680\n, 44 S. Ct. 134. \n\n[281 U.S. 519, 527]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner also insists that even though the Fleet Corporation is bound by its contracts, the liability has been undertaken by the United States by sections 2(b)(1), 2(b)(2), and 2(c) of the Merchant Marine Act of June 5, 1920, 41 Stat. 988 (46 USCA  862), which now affords the exclusive remedy for the enforcement of the liability. This legislation repealed, with certain specified exceptions, the emergency shipping fund provisions of the Urgent Deficiencies Act of June, 1917, as amended. Section 2(b)(1) directed that 'all contracts or agreements' previously made under the emergency shipping fund legislation 'be assumed and carried out by the United States Shipping Board.' But section 2(b) (2) saved all rights or remedies accruing as a result of such contracts and provided that they 'be exercised ... in like manner, subject to the provisions of subdivision (c)' of section 2. Subdivision (c) directed the Board to settle 'all matters arising out of or incident to the exercise by or through the President of any of the powers or duties ... imposed upon the President' by the earlier legislation 'and for this purpose the board, instead of the President, shall have and exercise any of such powers and duties relating to the determination and payment of just compensation.' It further provided that, 'Any person dissatisfied with any decision of the board shall have the same right to sue to United States as he would have had if the decision had been made by the President of the United States under the Acts' repealed.\n Petitioner points to no provisions of earlier acts giving to the President power to determine the amount due a contractor under a contract made by the Fleet Corporation, and respondent asserts that the powers of the President referred to in (c) are limited to the award of just compensation. But even if we assume that his powers were not so limited, we think subsection (c), at most, gave an additional remedy against the United States and not a substitute for existing remedies upon \n\n[281 U.S. 519, 528]\n\u00a0\n contract liabilities expressly preserved by subdivision (b)(2). The words of subdivision (b) (2), saving all existing remedies which 'may be exercised and enforced in like manner, subject to the provisions of subdivision (c),' must be taken to preserve the old remedies and to give the new one if the matter is one which the Board is authorized to settle by (c). Any other construction would nullify the saving clause of (b) (2), for if the 'decision of the Board' as used in the proviso of (c) embraces settlements of all matters arising out of contracts which, by paragraph (b)( 1), it was directed to carry out and in the event that its decision is not accepted, the exclusive remedy is by suit against the United States, then none of the remedies accruing under such contracts and in terms saved by paragraph 2, were preserved.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

That in addition to the taxes under existing law and under this act there shall be levied, assessed, collected, and paid for each taxable year upon the income of every corporation, partnership, or individual, a tax (hereinafter in this title referred to as the tax) equal to the following percentages of the net income: ...\n\n'Sec. 206. That for the purposes of this title the net income of a corporation shall be ascertained and returned ... (c) for the taxable year upon the same basis and in the same manner as provided in Title I of the Act entitled 'An Act to increase the revenue, and for other purposes,' approved September eighth, nineteen hundred and sixteen, as amended by this Act, except. ...'\n\n The Act of September 8, 1916, 39 Stat. 756, 765, 766, 767, 770, 771, c. 463, provided:\n Title I,  10. 'That there shall be levied, assessed, collected, and paid annually upon the total net income received in the preceding calendar year from all sources by every corporation, joint-stock company or association, or insurance company, organized in the United States, no matter how created or organized but not including partnerships, a tax of two per centum upon such income; ...\n'Sec. 12(a). In the case of a corporation, joint-stock company or association, or insurance company, organized in the United States, such net income shall be ascertained by deducting from the gross amount of its income received within the year from all sources' (Expenses, losses, interest, taxes.)\n\n'Sec. 13(a). The tax shall be computed upon the net income, as thus ascertained, received within each preceding calendar year ending December thirty-first: ...\n\n'(b) Every corporation, joint-stock company or association, or insurance company, subject to the tax herein imposed, shall, on or before the first day of March nineteen hundred and seventeen, ... render a true and accurate return of its annual net income in the manner and form to be prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and containing such facts, data, and information as are appropriate and in the opinion of the commissioner necessary to determine the correctness of the net income returned and to carry out the provisions of this title. The return shall be sworn to by the president, vice presi- \n\n[280 U.S. 412, 418]\n\u00a0\n payable to or by the company were treated as if discharged when incurred. Purporting to proceed as permitted by section 13(d), Title I, Revenue Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 771), they made returns to the collector upon the same basis. The Commissioner ascertained that the books showed excessive inventory values and thereby indicated net incomes much too small. The valuation placed on large quantities of tin plate had been marked up from $ 3.60 per box to $7, and the higher rather than the lower cost of this raw material had been reported. Thereupon, he dis- \n\n[280 U.S. 412, 419]\n\u00a0\n allowed the inflation, corrected the erroneous entries, and made reassessments according to the returns so modified. Respondents claimed that this action amounted to rejection of the basis upon which their returns and been made. Also that, after such rejection, no assessment could be made except one based upon receipts and disbursements; that is, upon amounts ascertained by deducting from gross income received, expenses paid out, losses charged off, interest, and taxes (section 12, Act 1916, 39 Stat. 767). And, further, that computation should be made without regard to inventories.\n\n The District Court of New Jersey and the Circuit Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, accepting respondents' view, awarded and approved judgments against the United States aggregating some $4,000,000. The result, we think, is manifestly erroneous. Upon the findings, judgments should have gone the other way.\n The claims of respondents rest upon improper construction of paragraph (d),  13, Act of September 8, 1916. This provides that 'a corporation ... keeping accounts upon any basis other than that of actual receipts and disbursements, unless such other basis does not clearly reflect its income, may, subject to regulations ... make its return upon the basis upon which its accounts are kept, in which case the tax shall be computed upon its income as so returned. ...'\n'Basis of keeping accounts' as there used refers to the general bookkeeping system followed by the taxpayer and not to the accuracy or propriety of mere individual items or entries upon the books. And to correct an improper item in a return-whether the result of mere error or designed-cannot properly be said to constitute rejection of the basis upon which the return was constructed. The statute empowers tax officers to make necessary rules and regulations and to take action essential to orderly \n\n[280 U.S. 412, 420]\n\u00a0\n enforcement of the obligations imposed. Here the taxpayers kept their accounts on the accrual basis and elected to make their returns accordingly. They cannot complain because an item therein was changed so as to conform with admitted facts. If their returns had been made on the basis of actual receipts and disbursements, certainly they would have been subject to correction for errors without changing the basis; and the same thing is true of returns framed upon an accrual basis.\n\n United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422, 437\n, 440 S., 443, 46 S. Ct. 131, considered the meaning of sections 12(a) and 13(d), Act of 1916, and sustained the action of the Commissioner who had reassessed according to an adjusted return originally made up on the accrual basis.\n We need not discuss the question whether under any circumstances the taxable income of a manufacturing or mercantile corporation can be ascertained without reference to inventory values. Certainly, in most instances, where the taxpayer carries on an extensive business, this cannot be done.\n The challenged judgments are reversed. The causes will be remanded to the District Court for appropriate action in harmony with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Revenue Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463, sec. 10 (39 Stat. 765 ), imposed taxes reckoned upon the amount of income.\n The Act of October 3, 1917, Chap. 63, 40 Stat. 300, 302, 303, 305, increased the income tax rates; also imposed an excess profits tax.

FARRAR(1930)\nNo. 732\nArgued: April 28, 1930Decided: May 26, 1930\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. G. A. Youngquist, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n[281 U.S. 624, 628]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William H. Lewis, of Boston, Mass., for appellee.\n\n\n[281 U.S. 624, 631]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By indictment returned in the federal District Court for Massachusetts, the defendant (appellee) was charged with unlawfully and knowingly having purchased intoxicating liquor fit for use for beverage purposes, in violation of the National Prohibition Act. The District Court sustained a motion to quash the indictment on the ground that the ordinary purchaser of intoxicating liquor does not come within the purview of the act. 38 F.(2d) 515. The government appealed under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246, U. S. Code, title 18,  682 (18 USCA  682), and section 238 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229,  1, 43 Stat. 936, 938; U. S. Code, title 28 ,  345 (28 USCA  345).\n Section 3 of title 2 of the National Prohibition Act, c. 85, 41 Stat. 305, 308 (27 USCA  12), makes it unlawful for any person to 'manufacture, sell, barter, transport, import, export, deliver, furnish or possess any intoxicating liquor except as authorized in this Act; ...' but provides that 'liquor for nonbeverage purposes and wine for sacramental purposes may be manufactured, purchased, sold ... but only as herein provided, and the commissioner may, upon application, issue permits therefor. ...'\n Section 6 of title 2 of the act, 41 Stat. 310 (27 USCA  16), provides: 'No one shall manufacture, sell, purchase, transport, or prescribe any liquor without first obtaining a permit from the commissioner so to do, except that a person may, without a permit, purchase and use liquor for medicinal purposes when prescribed by a physician as herein provided. ...' Following this language, the section regulates with much detail the issue, character, and duration of the permit, and the application therefor, which application, among other things, must set forth 'the qualification of the applicant and the purpose for which the liquor is to be use.' The form of the permit and application and the \n\n[281 U.S. 624, 632]\n\u00a0\n facts to be set forth therein are to be prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, who is to require a bond in such form and amount as he may prescribe to insure compliance with the terms of the permit and provisions of the act. A large part of the act, including section 6, is devoted to the subject of the authorized manufacture, sale, transportation, and use of intoxicating liquor for nonbeverage purposes; while section 3 plainly deals with the prohibited traffic in such liquors for beverage purposes.\n The government relies upon the literal terms of section 6, that 'no one shall ... purchase ... any liquor without first obtaining a permit from the commissioner so to do; ...' but, at the same time, frankly concedes that the application of this language to the present case is not free from doubt. The contrary case is not free these words, considered in connection with the other provisions of section 6 and correlated sections, relate only to that class of persons who are authorized to sell, purchase, or otherwise deal with intoxicating liquors for nonbeverage purposes, and who proceed to do so without a permit. That this defendant does not belong to that class, and could not, under any circumstances, have obtained a permit to make a purchase of the character here made, is not in dispute. The question thus presented is very nearly the same as that decided in United States v. Katz, \n271 \nU.S. 354\n, 46 S. Ct. 513; and in principle is concluded by that case.\n There the defendants were charged with conspiring to sell intoxicating liquors without making a permanent record of the sale, in violation of section 10 of title 2 of the act (27 USCA  22). The indictments were quashed in the District Court on the ground that section 10, which required a permanent record to be made of sales, applied only to persons authorized to sell alcoholic liquor, and that the indictment failed to allege that either of the defendants held a permit or was otherwise author- \n\n[281 U.S. 624, 633]\n\u00a0\n ized to sell. This court, in affirming the judgment, said at pages 361, 362, of 271 U. S., 46 S. Ct. 513, 515:\n'Of the 39 sections in Title 2 of the act, which deals with national prohibition, more than half, including the 7 sections which precede section 10, contain provisions authorizing or regulating the manufacture, sale, transportation, or use of intoxicating liquor for nonbeverage purposes. These provisions, read together, clearly indicate a statutory plan or scheme to regulate the disposition of alcoholic liquor not prohibited by the Eighteenth Amendment, in such manner as to minimize the danger of its diversion from authorized or permitted uses to beverage purposes. These provisions plainly relate to those persons who are authorized to sell, transport, use or possess intoxicating liquors under the Eighteenth Amendment and the provision of section 3 of the act, already quoted.'1\n\n And it was held at page 363 of 271 U. S., 46 S. Ct. 513, 516, that 'the words 'no person' in section 10 refer to persons authorized under other provisions of the act to carry on traffic in alcoholic liquors,' not to the ordinary violator of a provision prohibiting transactions in respect of liquors for beverage purposes.\n It is not necessary to repeat the citation of authorities or the pertinent canons of statutory construction set forth in the opinion to support this conclusion. We are unable to find any logical ground for holding that the words 'no person' in section 10 are used in the restricted sense thus stated, but that identical words in section 6, which forms a part of the same general plan for controlling the authorized traffic in intoxicating liquors, may be given an unlimited application. Obviously the National Prohibition Act deals with the liquor traffic from two different points of view. In the case of beverage liquors, except for sacramental and medicinal purposes, the traffic is prohibited \n\n[281 U.S. 624, 634]\n\u00a0\n absolutely and unconditionally; in the case of nonbeverage liquors, it is permitted but carefully regulated. The prohibitions in section 3 are with respect to the former; while those in section 6 are with respect to the latter. In the former the sale, but not the purchase, is prohibited; in the latter both are prohibited.\n Since long before the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment, it has been held with practical unanimity that, in the absence of an express statutory provision to the contrary, the purchaser of intoxicating liquor, the sale of which was prohibited, was guilty of no offense. And statutes to the contrary have been the rare exception. Probably it was thought more important to preserve the complete freedom of the purchaser to testify against the seller than to punish him for making the purchase. See Lott v. United States (C. C. A.) 205 F. 28, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 409. However that may be, it is fair to assume that Congress, when it came to pass the Prohibition Act, knew this history, and, acting in the light of it, deliberately and designedly omitted to impose upon the purchaser of liquor for beverage purposes any criminal liability. If aid were needed to support this view of the matter, it would be found in the fact, conceded by the government's brief, that during the entire life of the National Prohibition Act, a period of ten years, the executive departments charged with the administration and enforcement of the act have uniformly construed it as not including the purchaser in a case like the present; no prosecution until the present one has ever been undertaken upon a different theory; and Congress, of course well aware of this construction and practice, has significantly left the law in its original form. It follows that, since the indictment charges no offense under section 6, it was properly quashed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This refers to the portion of section 3 relating to the manufacture, etc., of liquor for nonbeverage purposes and wine for sacramental purposes. \n\n\n\n\n","135":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

Ct. 42, and the opinion there contains sufficient description of them, their business and operations.\n In 1926 the appellee distributors caused each of the thirty-two film boards of trade to adopt written rules for establishment and operation of a local credit committee. These committees were promptly organized, and have continued to function as required. The prescribed rules provide:\n That, to correct abuses and unfair practices, the president shall appoint a credit committee of three members to investigate and report the names of all persons who have acquired, by purchase or transfer, theaters in the territory within which the film board operates. The secretary of the film board shall be secretary of the committee, and to him sales and transfers of theaters shall be promptly reported. These shall be placed upon a 'credit information list' and copies furnished to all members of the film board for their confidential information. Upon receipt of such list, each member shall advise the secretary concerning its existing contracts for exhibition of pictures at the listed theater and shall state whether the transfer provided that the new owner should assume and complete outstanding contracts.\n That, immediately upon receiving information of the transfer of a theater the secretary shall request the new owner to furnish within five days references concerning his credit standing, etc., and to secure this information a prescribed form of questionnaire shall be sent out. The credit committee shall meet weekly to examine and report \n\n[282 U.S. 44, 50]\n\u00a0\n upon the credit standing of new owners and furnish a copy of their report to members as confidential information. If a new owner fails to respond to the questionnaire, this fact shall be noted upon the credit information list. Also the credit committee shall indicate on the list every sale or transfer of a theater which upon investigation it concludes was made by the previous owner for the purpose of avoiding or being relieved of uncompleted contracts for exhibiting pictures at such theater. There shall also be indicated opposite the name of each theater listed, excepting those whose new owners have agreed to assume and complete all existing contracts entered into by the prior owners, and of which agreement notice has been given to or received by the credit committee, the amount of cash security, not exceeding $1,000, which in the judgment of the committee is a reasonable sum that members shall require to be deposited as security for the full and complete performance of each contract thereafter made and entered into for the exhibition of pictures at such theater.\n That no member of the film board shall enter into a contract for the exhibition of pictures at any theater listed on the credit information list for a period of ten days from the date of the first appearance of such theater upon the list nor thereafter unless the new owner or lessee of such theater shall have paid in cash to such member with whom such owner or lessee desires to contract for pictures the amount of security specified on the credit information list. Certain contracts for 'spot- booking,' that is, for a picture to be delivered in the immediate future, may be made within the ten-day period and prior to the committee's report. The credit committee may from time to time remove from the credit information list the name of any theater owned or operated by a new owner, and thereafter members of the film board may contract with him. \n\n[282 U.S. 44, 51]\n\u00a0\n That members upon demand of the credit committee shall furnish desired information, permit examination of books and records with respect to any exhibitor who has sold or transferred his theater and has failed to provide for the assumption by the new owner of existing contracts. A member of the film board who violates any of these rules shall be subject to suspension or expulsion.\n A copy of the 'Questionnaire' is printed in the margin. \n1\n It asks for many particulars concerning the new \n\n[282 U.S. 44, 52]\n\u00a0\n owner or transferee of the transferred theater, and especially demands specification of outstanding contracts for film service made by the previous owner and a declaration as to whether the new one has or will adopt them. \n\n[282 U.S. 44, 53]\n\u00a0\n The definite point of attack in this proceeding is the agreement for the creation and operation of the credit committees and their use under prescribed rules to restrict freedom of sales by distributors and of purchases by exhibitors. \n\n[282 U.S. 44, 54]\n\u00a0\n Ten producers and distributors of films, controlling 60 per cent. of the business, agreed to contract with exhibitors only according to a standard form, and then combined through thirty-two local film Boards of Trade with other distributors, who with themselves control 98 per cent. of the entire business. The film boards appoint credit committees, and these operate under the rules above outlined. The obvious purpose of the arrangement is to restrict the liberty of those who have representatives on the film boards and secure their concerted action for the purpose of coercing certain purchasers of theaters by excluding them from the opportunity to deal in a free and untrammeled market.\n Reference to what has just been said in No. 83 and to the opinions in Eastern States Lumber Ass'n v. \n\n[282 U.S. 44, 55]\n\u00a0\n United States, \n234 \nU.S. 600\n, 34 S.

JACKSON(1930)\nNo. 57\nArgued: December 5, 1929Decided: January 6, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 183, 184]\n\u00a0\n In accordance with the provisions of the Act of Congress of July 4, 1884, c. 180,  1 (23 Stat. 76, 96; 43 U. S. C. 190 (43 USCA  190)), the United States, on December 11, 1891, issued to Jack Williams, an Indian, a trust patent on certain lands. The patent recited that the United States would hold the lands in trust for the sole use and benefit of Williams, or, in case of his decease, of his widow and heirs, for a period of 25 years from the date thereof, and that at the expiration of such time the United States would convey the land to Williams, or his widow or heirs, in fee and free of the trust or any incumbrance whatever.\n Before the expiration of the 25-year trust period, Williams died, and his interest in the land passed to his widow and sole heir, Nellie Williams, an Indian woman. She held the land until March 18, 1921, more than four years after the trust period, by its terms, would have expired, and then deeded it to Jack Jackson, also an Indian. In the succeeding year- October 10, 1922-she died, leaving a will by which the same property was devised to Bob Roberts, a tribale Indian.\n The deed to Jackson was recorded November 3, 1922; but the Secretary of the Interior has never approved it.\n Nellie Williams' will, and the devise to Roberts therein contained, were approved by the Secretary of the Interior, December 1, 1923\n\n\n This is a suit by the United States against the heirs of Jack Jackson. It is brought on behalf of Bob Roberts, and its purpose is to quiet title in him to the lands in question. The position of the United States is that, \n\n[280 U.S. 183, 185]\n\u00a0\n while it is true that the deed to Jackson was made after the original 25- year trust period, with its attendant restrictions on alienation, had, by the terms of the trust patent, expired, it further appears that the restrictions on the alienation of this land by Williams or his heirs has been continued in force and extended by a series of 1-year executive orders from 1916 to 1919, and by a further 25-year executive order issued in 1920. The executive orders in question were, it is urged, authorized by the Act of Congress of June 21, 1906 (chapter 3504, 34 Stat. 325, 326).\n The United States therefore argued that the deed to Jackson, having been made while there was a restriction on alienation, and not having been approved by the Secretary of the Interior, was void.\n The District Court (27 F.(2d) 751) held that the Act of June 21, 1906, did not authorize the President to continue the restrictions on alienation contained in the patent issued to Williams. The purpose of the 1906 act, said the District Court, was to permit the continuation of restrictions in patents issued to Indian allottees, that is, to Indians who received patents under the General Allotment Act of February 8, 1887, which created the Indian allotment system, or under any of its subsequent amendments (25 USCA  331 et seq.); but that the 1906 act did not purport to give the President a like power with respect to Indians who received their patents under the Act of July 4, 1884 which conferred homestead entry rights upon Indians.\n The court therefore held that the restrictions on the alienation of this land had expired at the time Williams' widow deeded it to Jackson; that there was no statute expressly extending the restrictions, and no statute authorizing the President so to do; that the deed to Jackson conformed to the law of the state where it was executed, and it was valid. \n\n[280 U.S. 183, 186]\n\u00a0\n The United States appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The judges of that court, being in doubt, have certified to us, conformably to section 239 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of February 13, 1925 (chapter 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938, 28 USCA  346), the two following questions of law concerning which our instruction is desired for the proper decision of the cause:\n'1. Could the trust period and the restriction of alienation in an Indian homestead patent issued under the Act of July 4, 1884 (43 USCA  190), be extended by executive orders?\n\n'2. Did the Act of June 21, 1906 (25 USCA  391), authorize the President in his discretion to continue restrictions on alienation in patents issued under the Indian Homestead Act of July 4, 1884 (43 USCA  190)?'\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Richardson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n\n\n[280 U.S. 183, 188]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice TAFT, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The statute under which the Indian, Jack Williams, secured his trust patent to the land here involved, was \n\n[280 U.S. 183, 189]\n\u00a0\n that of July 4, 1884 (chapter 180, 23 Stat. 96 (43 USCA  190)), the pertinent part of section 1 of which is printed in the margin. \n1\n Its purpose and effect were to extend to the Indian wards of the United States, subject, however, to the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, the privileges then enjoyed by citizens of the United States under the federal homestead laws. It was provided that patents issued to Indians for homestead lands under the act should, however, recite that the United States holds the land in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian for a period of 25 years, and that at the expiration of such period the United States would convey the same by final patent to the Indian or his widow and heirs in fee and discharged of the trust. The trust patent here issued to Williams conformed to these requirements of the law.\n The first question certified to us by the Circuit Court of Appeals is whether, after an Indian had acquired a trust patent under the provisions of this statute, power remained in the Congress to extend, or to provide that the Executive, in his discretion, might extend, before its expiration and before there had come to be issued to the Indian a patent in fee, the period of the trust with its \n\n[280 U.S. 183, 190]\n\u00a0\n resulting restrictions on alienation. We do not think that our decisions leave any doubt, not only that it is within the power, but that it is the duty, of the Congress, where it finds conditions which warrant it, so to do. We have had frequent occasion to point out the duty of the United States to protect its wards, the Indians, and the consequent broad extent of its power over them and their affairs. United States v. Kagama, \n118 \nU.S. 375, 384\n, 6 S. Ct. 1109; United States v. Nice, \n241 \nU.S. 591, 597\n, 36 S. Ct. 696. There is nothing in the act of 1884 which indicates any disposition on the part of the United States to dispossess itself of its powers and duties as guardian, or so to change the status of its wards as to leave them no longer subject to manifestations of its protection. On the contrary, the provisions of the act leave no doubt that it is an act done by the United States in its capacity as guardian, and that the rights conferred by the act upon the Indians were so conferred principally because they were wards of the government. This is shown by the provisions exempting Indians from the payment of the usual fees, and by the provision respecting the form of the trust patent, and the restrictions on alienation.\n This being so, we fail to find anything in the Act of June 21, 1906 ( 25 USCA  391), which transcends the valid powers of the government over its wards. Passing, for the moment, the question whether the act of 1906 was intended to apply to Indian homesteaders claiming under the act of 1884, and assuming, for the purposes of question No. 1, that the word 'allottee' was intended to include such Indians, we find that the act provides:\n'That prior to the expiration of the trust period of any Indian allottee to whom a trust or other patent containing restrictions upon alienation has been or shall be issued under any law or treaty the President may in his discretion continue such restrictions on alienation for such period as he may deem best. ...' 25 USCA  391. \n\n[280 U.S. 183, 191]\n\u00a0\n This does not involve any question of an attempt to destroy vested rights. The power of the United States, delegated by the act to the President, is to be exercised prior to the issuance of final patent. It has been held that until final patent be issued no vested right is obtained by the Indian which would support a constitutional objection to the enlargement of the period of the restriction. See United States v. Allen (C. C. A.) 179 F. 13, 22, 23; United States v. Hemmer (D. C.) 195 F. 790.\n\n What has here occurred is that the United States has conferred a privilege upon its wards-as such-and has surrounded its final acquisition with restrictions calculated to secure the advantage of the privilege to those intended to be benefited. Finding that the restrictions authorized at the time of the extension of the privilege will not, in all cases, be long continued enough to secure this result, Congress has authorized the Executive, in his discretion, to continue the restrictions for such period as he may deem best. That this is within the constitutional power of Congress must be considered as concluded by our decisions in Tiger v. Western Investment Company, \n221 \nU.S. 286\n, 31 S. Ct. 578, Heckman v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 413\n, 32 S. Ct. 424, and Brader v. James, \n246 \nU.S. 88\n, 38 S. Ct. 285.\n The first question must be answered in the affirmative.\n But it is suggested, and the District Court has held, that since the language of the Act of June 21, 1906, refers only to Indian allottees, it cannot be considered as authorizing the President to continue restrictions on alienation in patents issued to Indian homesteaders under the Act of July 4, 1884. In ruling that the 1906 act did not apply to the trust patent issued to Williams since he was not an allottee, but an Indian homesteader, claiming by virtue of the 1884 act which extended the benefits of the homestead laws to the Indians, and not under the General Allotment Act of 1887 or any of its amendments, the District Court relied upon Seaples v. Card (D. C.) 246 F. \n\n[280 U.S. 183, 192]\n\u00a0\n 501. In that case a homestead patent was issued to a non-tribal Indian under the Act of July 4, 1884, and, as required by that act, the patent declared-as does the one here-that the United States held the title in trust for the Indian for a period of 25 years, and would then issue him or his heirs a patent in fee. Before the expiration of this trust period, the Land Department, assuming to act either under the Allotment Act of 1887, or the Act of May 8, 1906 (chapter 2348, 34 Stat. 182 (25 USCA  349) amendatory thereof, cancelled the original trust patent and issued a new patent giving the Indian title in fee simple. The Act of May 8, 1906, provided that the Secretary of the Interior might, in his discretion, whenever he should be satisfied that any 'Indian allottee' was competent and capable of managing his or her affairs, cause to be issued to such allottee a patent in fee simple, and the District Court held in that case that this statute gave no authority to the Secretary to cancel the patent issued to Seaples under the 1884 act, which extended the benefit of the homestead laws to the Indians, but that the 1906 act applied only to 'Indian allottees.'\n Into the correctness of this decision we do not inquire. It is not, however, controlling here since it turned upon the interpretation of the Act of May 8, 1906, and did not involve any question concerning proper construction of the Act of June 21 of that year, which is presently involved.\n Our inquiry is whether Congress intended to include within the meaning of the word 'allottees' as used in the latter act, Indian wards of the United States holding homestead lands by virtue of the act of 1884. It is argued that Congress did so intend, but that the legislators used only the term 'allottee' and did not add 'or Indian homesteader' because, while such addition would have prevented the question here involved from arising, it would have added further confusion for the reason that \n\n[280 U.S. 183, 193]\n\u00a0\n the language is too broad and would include as well as tribal Indians claiming as wards of the United States under the act of 1884, Indians claiming as citizens-not as Indian wards-under the general homestead laws. The purpose of the language used is therefore not so plainly apparent as to preclude resort to judicial interpretation. On the contrary, if effect is to be given to the true intent of the Congress, we must avail ourselves of sources of information other than the language of the act in order to aid us in the disclosure of that intention. There is here no lack of familiar and approved sources from which light upon the proper construction of this statute may be obtained.\n It is a familiar rule of statutory construction that great weight is properly to be given to the construction consistently given to a statute by the Executive Department charged with its administration. United States v. Cerecedo Hermanosy Compania, \n209 \nU.S. 337\n, 28 S. Ct. 532; Robertson v. Downing, \n127 \nU.S. 607\n, 8 S. Ct. 1328 32 L. Ed. 269; United States v. Healey, \n160 \nU.S. 136\n, 16 S. Ct. 247. And such construction is not be overturned unless clearly wrong, or unless a different construction is plainly required. United States v. Johnston, \n124 \nU.S. 236, 253\n, 8 S. Ct. 446; Hawley v. Diller, \n178 \nU.S. 476, 488\n, 20 S. Ct. 986. Applying this rule, we find from the Case of Toss Weaxta, 47 Land Dec. 574, that it has long been the settled ruling of the department of the Interior, both under the very statutes here involved and under other statutes enacted by Congress with similar purpose and pursuant to its general plan with respect to Indian allotments and homesteads, that Indian allotments and Indian homesteads are in all essential respects upon the same footing, and that each is equally within the purview of a statute in which the Congress may use only the terms 'allottee' and 'allotment.'\n The Case of Toss Weaxta, supra, was in all essential respects identical with this case, and it involved the same question of law under the same two statutes. Weaxta had \n\n[280 U.S. 183, 194]\n\u00a0\n received a trust patent under the act of 1884 (43 USCA  190), and, at the expiration of the 25-year trust period, he applied to the Commissioner of the General Land Office to issue to him a patent in fee covering his homestead. The Commissioner denied the application, on the ground that the trust period had been, by order of the President, extended, pursuant to the power given the President by the Act of June 21, 1906. Weaxta appealed to the Secretary of the Interior, claiming that an Indian homestead, such as he held, was not an Indian allotment, and that the Act of June 21, 1906, by its terms limits the authority to extend the trust periods to 'Indian allotments only.' The First Assistant Secretary, in affirming the decision of the Commissioner, found:\n'The department all along has considered Indian homesteads and Indian allotments upon the public lands as being upon practically the same footing, and Congress has recognized the similarity.'\n\n He concluded, from a review of laws pari materia, the condition and standing of the Indians, and the obligations of the government, that both Indian homesteads and Indian allotments must be considered as included within the meaning of the Act of June 21, 1906.\n In the Case of Jim Crow, 32 Land Dec. 657, 659, the question was whether lands inherited from a deceased Indian homesteader came within the provisions of the Act of May 27, 1902 (32 Stat. 245, 275, (25 USCA  379)), which act, by its terms, authorized the sale and conveyance of inherited Indian lands by the heirs of a deceased allottee. The Assistant Attorney General held that the act applied to the heirs of all Indian claimants for portions of the public lands, to whom a trust or other patent containing restrictions upon alienation had been issued, regardless of whether the claim of the Indian was initiated under what are known as Indian homestead laws or under Indian allotment laws. This ruling was approved by the Acting Secretary of the Interior. 32 Land Dec. p. 659. In that ruling the similarity of \n\n[280 U.S. 183, 195]\n\u00a0\n the claims of Indians arising out of rights conferred upon them by the General Allotment Act and by the act of 1884 which gave them homestead entry rights, was pointed out. It was there said:\n'The General Allotment Act, so far as it affects public lands, and the preceding Indian homestead provisions, are so clearly connected that they should be construed in pari materia as relating to the same subject-matter. The later Allotment Act but carries forward the policy of the former enactments to give Indians a right to secure homes upon the public domain.\n\n'Congress has recognized that allotment claims are of the same nature as homestead rights. A fund has been provided for assisting Indian homesteaders and carried upon the books of the Treasury Department under the title 'Homesteads for Indians,' and by the Act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 989, 1007), the Secretary of the Interior was authorized and directed to apply the balance of this fund for the employment of allotting agents 'to assist Indians desiring to take homesteads under section 4' of the Act of February 8, 1887.\n\n'Here Congress characterized claims under the allotment act as homesteads. Claims under the various laws relating to Indian homesteads may with equal propriety be characterized as allotments. In fact the terms mean substantially the same thing so far as the laws in which they are found affect the public lands and so far as the interests of the Indian claimant are concerned.\n\n'This Department has considered Indian homesteads upon practically the same footing as Indian allotments upon the public lands. It is held that the government is bound to protect the rights of the Indian homesteader during the trust period, that no preference right of entry is obtained by contest against an Indian homestead and a relinquishment of an Indian homestead entry does not become effective until approved by this Department. \n\n[280 U.S. 183, 196]\n\u00a0\n Doc Jim, 32 Land Dec. 291. These rules apply also to Indian allotments. The control, jurisdiction, and obligations of the Department are the same in one case as in the other.\n\n'The objects of the law relating to Indian homesteads are the same as those relating to Indian allotments on the public lands, the status of the Indian claimant is the same under both classes of laws, the duties and obligations of the government are the same. Both the legislative and executive branches of the government have recognized these similarities of purpose in the laws, standing of claimants thereunder, and obligations of the government.'\n\n The ruling of the Department of the Interior has been to the same effect under the Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 855). It was held that that act empowered the Secretary to determine the heirs of an Indian to whom a homestead trust patent had been issued under the act of 1884, when the Indian dies before the expiration of the trust, notwithstanding that the act provides only 'that when any Indian to whom an allotment of land has been made, or may hereafter be made, dies before the expiration of the trust period,' the Secretary may determine his heirs. Toss Weaxta, 47 Land Dec. at 577.\n We find that the Indian Homestead Act of July 4, 1884, and the General Allotment Act of February 8, 1887, with its various amendments, constitute part of a single system evidencing a continuous purpose on the part of the Congress. The statutes are in pari materia, and must be so construed. It cannot be supposed that Congress, in any part of this legislation, all of which is directed, toward the benefit and protection of the Indians, as such, intended to exclude from the beneficent policy which each act evidences, an Indian claiming under the homestead act, even though the statute uses the term 'allottee.' If there were any doubt on the question, he silence of Congress in the face of the long continued practice of the \n\n[280 U.S. 183, 197]\n\u00a0\n Department of the Interior in construing statutes which refer only to Indian 'allottees,' or Indian 'allotments,' as applicable also to Indians claiming under the homestead laws, must be considered as 'equivalent to consent to continue the practice until the power was revoked by some subsequent action by Congress.' United States v. Midwest Oil Co., \n236 \nU.S. 459, 481\n, 35 S. Ct. 309, 316.\n Nothing herein contained must be taken as intimating that the Act of June 21, 1906, has any application to the acquisition of homestead rights under the general homestead laws by persons of the Indian race who have acquired or seek to acquire such rights as citizens rather than as Indian wards of the United States. This distinction is pointed out in Case of Frank Bergeron, 30 Land Dec. 375.\n Both questions answered, 'Yes.' \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'That such Indians as may now be located on public lands, or as may, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, or otherwise, hereafter, so locate may avail themselves of the provisions of the homestead laws as fully and to the same extent as may now be done by citizens of the United States; ... but no fees or commissions shall be charged on account of said entries or proofs. All patents therefor shall be of the legal effect, and declare that the United States does and will hold the land thus entered for the period of twenty-five years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian by whom such entry shall have been made, or, in case of his decease, of his widow and heirs according to the laws of the state or territory where such land is located, and that at the expiration of said period the United States will convey the same by patent to said Indian, or his widow and heirs as aforesaid, in fee, discharged of said trust and free of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever.' \n\n\n\n\n","137":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. Frederic L. Ballard, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Norris and one Kerper were indicted by the federal grand jury for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, charged in two counts with conspiring unlawfully to trans port \n\n[281 U.S. 619, 621]\n\u00a0\n and cause to be transported, from Philadelphia to New York, certain shipments of intoxicating liquor, in violation of the National Prohibition Act of October 28, 1919, c. 85, tit. 2,  3, 41 Stat. 305, 308, U. S. Code, title 27,  12 (27 USCA  12). The indictment is sufficient in form and substance. Kerper pleaded guilty, and Norris entered a plea of nolo contendere. When the latter appeared for sentence, there was filed a stipulation of facts which it was agreed should be taken to be true and of record with like effect as if set forth in the indictment. The pertinent portion of the stipulation is copied in the margin. \n1\n Thereupon, Norris submitted in arrest of judgment upon the grounds \n\n[281 U.S. 619, 622]\n\u00a0\n that upon the face of the record he was not guilty of the crime charged; that the record disclosed that he merely purchased liquor, and that this did not constitute a crime; and that the record failed to show such degree of affirmative co-operation on his part as would render him liable as a conspirator in the unlawful transportation. The motion was denied, and judgment rendered against Norris, who was, thereupon sentenced to pay a fine of $200. The District Court treated the stipulation as 'evidence ... for the information of the court in determining what sentence, if any, ought to be imposed upon the defendant Norris,' which it 'received and made part of the record for the limited purpose above stated.' United States v. Kerper, 29 F. (2d) 744, 745. The Court of Appeals sustained the sufficiency of the indictment, but, considering the case upon the stipulation of facts, reached the conclusion that the transactions therein disclosed did not subject the purchaser and seller of intoxicating liquor to an indictment for conspiracy to transport, and reversed the judgment of the trial court. Norris v. United States, 34 F.(2d) 839.\n In the face of an indictment good in form and substance, and of a plea thereto of nolo contendere, which, although it does not create an estoppel, has all the effect of a plea of guilty for the purposes of the case (Hudson v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 451, 455\n, 47 S. Ct. 127; United States v. Lair (C. C. A) 195 F. 47, 51), the stipulation was ineffective to import an issue as to the sufficiency of the indictment, or an issue of fact upon the question of guilt or innocence. If the stipulation be regarded as adding particulars to the indictment, it must fall before the rule that nothing can be added to an indictment without the concurrence of the grand jury by which the bill was found. Ex parte Bain, \n121 \nU.S. 1\n, 7 S. Ct. 781. If filed before plea and given effect, such a \n\n[281 U.S. 619, 623]\n\u00a0\n stipulation would oust the jurisdiction of the court. Id., page 13, citing ( at pages 8, 9 of 121 U. S., 7 S. Ct. 781) Commonwealth v. Mahar, 16 Pick. ( Mass.) 120, and People v. Campbell, 4 Parker Cr. R. (N. Y.) 386, 387, holding that the defendant's consent does not affect the rule. After the plea, nothing is left but to render judgment, for the obvious reason that in the face of the plea no issue of fact exists, and none can be made while the plea remains of record. Regarded as evidence upon the question of guilt or innocence, the stipulation came too late, for the plea of nolo contendere, upon that question and for that case, was as conclusive as a plea of guilty would have been. And as said by Mr. Justice Shiras in Hallinger v. Davis, \n146 \nU.S. 314, 318\n, 13 S. Ct. 105, 106: 'If a recorded confession of every material averment of an indictment puts the confessor upon the country, the institution of jury trial and the legal effect and nature of a plea of guilty have been very imperfectly understood, not only by the authors of the constitution and their successors down to the present time, but also by all the generations of men who have lived under the common law.'\n The court was no longer concerned with the question of guilt, but only with the character and extent of the punishment. People ex rel. Hubert v. Kaiser, 206 N. Y. 46, 51, 52, 99 N. E. 195. The remedy of the accused, if he thought he had not violated the law, was to withdraw, by leave of court, the plea of nolo contendere, enter one of not guilty, and, upon the issue thus made, submit the facts for determination in the usual and orderly way.\n As to whether the stipulated facts, if open to consideration, make out a case of criminal conspiracy, we express no opinion.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the District Court affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Defendant, Alfred E.

Gen., for the United States.\n Messrs. Francis A. Brogan and Alfred G. Ellick, both of Omaha, Neb., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Prior to the passage of the Revenue Act of 1917, the Updike Grain Company, a Nebraska corporation, filed its income tax and excess profits tax returns for the eleven months ending June 30, 1917, that being the end of the fiscal year which the corporation had selected as its annual period for federal taxation. The returns in form complied with the provisions of the law then in force, and were correct in point of fact. The full amount of the tax, as shown by the returns, was paid. In August, 1917, the corporation was lawfully dissolved and its assets, after payment of all debts, were distributed among its stockholders. Shortly after the passage of the Revenue Act of October 3, 1917 (40 Stat. 300), which, among other changes, increased the rate of taxation, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue issue a regulation providing that corporations which had dissolved in 1917 prior to the date of that act should file tax returns in accordance with its provisions for the period preceding dissolution. A blank form for that purpose was mailed to the corporation, but was returned by \n\n[281 U.S. 489, 491]\n\u00a0\n its former secretary unexecuted, with the information that the corporation, prior to its dissolution, had filed tax returns and paid all taxes due under existing laws.\n In October, 1918, a revenue agent examined the books of the corporation and made a return in regular form, upon which, in January, 1920, additional income and excess profits taxes were assessed for the period ending June 30, 1917. The return so made was not verified or signed in behalf of the corporation, or otherwise. The present suit to recover the amount was brought against respondents, stockholders of the corporation, in 1927, more than seven years after the assessment. The theory upon which the suit was begun and prosecuted is that the assets of the corporation distributed to the stockholders, to the extent of the additional taxes, became trust funds received to the use of the United States. The federal District Court entered a decree dismissing the bill. 25 F.(2d) 746. Upon appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree upon the ground that the suit was barred by the provisions of section 278(a)(c) and (d) of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 59; U. S. Code Supp., title 26,  1058, 1060, 1061 (26 USCA  1058, 1060, 1061), 32 F.(2d) 1.\n The principal question presented here, and the only one we need consider, is whether the suit, having been brought more than six years after the assessment, was barred by the provisions of section 278 quoted below.\n'(a) In the case ... of a failure to file a return the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time. ...\n\n'(d) Where the assessment ... has been made (whether before or after the enactment of this Act) within the statutory period of limitation properly applicable thereto, such tax may be collected by distrint or by a proceeding \n\n[281 U.S. 489, 492]\n\u00a0\n in court (begun before or after the enactment of this Act), but only if begun (1) within six years after the assessment of the tax ....' U. S. Code Supp., title 26,  1058, 1061 (26 USCA  1058, 1061).\n\n In accordance with the claim of the government, the court below held that there was a failure to file a return within the meaning of paragraph ( a). See, also, Updike v. United States (C. C. A.) 8 F.(2d) 913. We assume without deciding the correctness of that view and consider the case accordingly.\n The government contends: (1) That section 278(d) relates only to proceedings to collect taxes qua taxes, and not to suits in equity to recover 'trust funds,' and that the present suit is of the latter character; but (2) that the present case is not within the provisions of that section even if a suit against the stockholders be controlled by the same rule as a proceeding against the corporation itself.\n First. The first point turns upon the question whether this is a proceeding to collect a tax, as to which it is said that the provision of section 278(d) that 'such tax may be collected ... by a proceeding in court,' etc., refers only to a direct proceeding against the taxpayer; and that this view is borne out by a consideration of section 280 (chapter 27, 44 Stat. 9, 61; U. S. Code Supp., title 26,  1069 (26 USCA  1069)),1 \n\n[281 U.S. 489, 493]\n\u00a0\n which prescribes a mode of procedure against transferees of the property of a taxpayer.\n The contention is that by the language of section 280 Congress has clearly differentiated between taxpayers and transferees by referring to the liability of the latter as 'the liability, at law or in equity, of a transferee of property of a taxpayer, in respect of the tax ... imposed upon the taxpayer,' and then, apparently realizing that the limitation periods as to the collection of taxes qua taxes would have no application to the remedy against transferees, creating a distinct period of limitation in respect thereof.\n This view of the statute is not admissible. The plain words of  280( a) are that, 'except as hereinafter in this section provided,' the liability of the transferee shall be 'assessed, collected, and paid,' subject, among other things, to the same 'provisions and limitations as in the case of a deficiency in a tax imposed by this title \n\n[281 U.S. 489, 494]\n\u00a0\n (including ... the provisions authorizing ... proceedings in court for collected ...).' Nothing thereinafter provided in that section affects the application to the present case of these general words in respect of limitations, for, while the succeeding paragraphs contain provisions of limitation in respect of assessment, they contain none in respect of collection. It seems plain enough, without stopping to cite authority, that the present suit, though not against the corporation but against its transferees to subject assets in their hands to the payment of the tax, is in every real sense a proceeding in court to collect a tax. The tax imposed upon the corporation is the basis of the liability, whether sought to be enforced directly against the corporation or by suit against its transferees. The aim in the one case, as in the other, is to enforce a tax liability; and the effect of the language above quoted from section 280 is to read into that section, and make applicable to the transferee equally with the original taxpayer, the provision of section 278(d) in relation to the period of limitation for the collection of a tax. Indeed, when used to connote payment of a tax, it puts no undue strain upon the word 'taxpayer' to bring within its meaning that person whose property, being impressed with a trust to that end, is subjected to the burden. Certainly it would be hard to convince such a person that he had not paid a tax.\n Second. It follows that, if by section 278(d) the period of limitation had run in favor of the corporation, it had run in favor of the transferees. The contention of the government that the section does not apply under the facts of the present case depends upon the meaning of the phrase which we have italicized: 'Where the assessment ... has been made ... within the statutory period of limi- \n\n[281 U.S. 489, 495]\n\u00a0\n tation property applicable thereto, such tax may be collected ... by a proceeding in court ... but only if begun (1) within six years after the assessment of the tax. ...' The argument, in effect, is this: In 1920 when the assessment was made, there was, and had been, no provision of law which in any form limited the time for assessing or collecting taxes, and therefore an assessment in 1920 of 1917 taxes could not fulfill the requirements of section 278(d), because, in that view, there was no 'statutory period of limitation properly applicable thereto;' and, assuming the applicable of statutes passed after 1920, the provision in these statutes is that the assessment may be made 'at any time,' and that is not a period of limitation within the meaning of section 278(d), for the word 'period' connotes a stated interval of time commonly thought of in terms of years, months, and days.\n The clear intent of section 278, as applied to the facts of the present case, was to designate the extent of time for the enforcement of the tax liability. Where, in a 'no return' case, an assessment, which, under paragraph (a), may be made at any time, has in fact been made, a proceeding to collect must be begun within six years thereafter; but, where there has been no assessment, the proceeding may be begun at any time. In the present case there was an assessment, and it would not be doubted that the suit was barred at the expiration of the six-year period of limitation, unless for the presence of the words italicized above. Have these words the effect of averting the bar? We think not. An actual assessment having been made, it must be assumed that the government was in possession of the facts which gave rise to the liability upon which the assessment was predicated. In such case to allow an indefinite time for proceeding to collect the \n\n[281 U.S. 489, 496]\n\u00a0\n tax would be out of harmony with the obvious policy of the act to promote repose by fixing a definite period after assessment within which suits and proceedings for the collection of taxes must be brought.\n In the light of that policy, it seems reasonably clear that the saving clause, 'within the statutory period of limitation properly applicable thereto,' was inserted solely for the protection of the taxpayer-that is to say, in order to preclude collection of the tax even within six years after the assessment, if that assessment, when made, was barred by the applicable statutory limitation. This conclusion is confirmed, if confirmation be necessary, by the provisions of paragraph (a ), which clearly contemplate that the six-year period shall apply, except where the proceeding to collect is brought 'without assessment,' in which event it may be brought 'at any time.'\n It may be that the saving clause was not strictly necessary, but was inserted from excessive care to put the right of the taxpayer beyond dispute. In any event, we think this is the fair interpretation of the clause, and the one which must be accepted, especially in view of the rule which requires taxing acts, including provisions of limitation embodied therein, to be construed liberally in favor of the taxpayer. Bowers v. N. Y. & Albany Co., \n273 \nU.S. 346, 349\n, 47 S. Ct. 389.\n This disposes of the case, and it becomes unnecessary to determine whether the phrase, 'at any time,' imports a 'period of limitation,' or to consider other questions presented in argument. Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 280.

I., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The deceased enlisted in the army April 2, 1917, and was discharged March 18, 1918. He obtained insurance for $10,000, payable in the event of death or total permanent disability at the rate of $57.50 per month. Act of October 6, 1917, 40 Stat. 398, 409. The contract was in force when he was discharged. He presented to the Veterans' Bureau a claim for permanent total disability from \n\n[281 U.S. 339, 340]\n\u00a0\n that date. It was rejected December 29, 1926. He died January 7, 1927\n\n\n April 23, his mother as administratrix brought this action in the United States court for Nebraska to recover on account of his disability from the date of discharge to the time of his death. 38 U. S. C.  445 (38 USCA  445). July 6 she intervened as beneficiary to recover installments maturing after his death. There was a verdict on which, October 31, 1928, judgment was entered in her favor as administratrix for.$6,095 and as beneficiary for $3,905. Later the District Court entered a supplemental judgment that as beneficiary she was then entitled to $1,265 on account of the installments falling due before the original judgment; that the balance, $2,640, should be paid at the rate of $57.50 per month commencing November 1, 1928; that she have interest on all installments from the dates on which they became due to the date of judgment and thereafter interest on the amount of the judgment; and that she recover costs. The United States appealed. The Circuit Court of Appeals certified the four questions which are given below. 28 U. S. C.  346 (28 USCA  346).\n\n 1. \nUpon the facts stated (in the certificate), does the United States, as matter of law, stand in the position of one who has gone into the business of insurance, and must therefore be assumed to have accepted the ordinary incidents of suits in such business?\n Apparently, this question was suggested by language in our decision in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 76, 79\n, 45 S. Ct. 211. While the answer sought might aid in the determination of the proper application of that opinion, it is not necessary for the decision of the case. The question is one of objectionable generality. United States v. Mayer, \n235 \nU.S. 55, 66\n, 35 S. Ct. 16. It need not be answered.\n\n 2. \nMay judgment be entered against the United States for the amounts of insurance installments maturing after the action was instituted? \n\n[281 U.S. 339, 341]\n\u00a0\n Undoubtedly, when one's right to recover is established by judgment, the Veterans' Bureau will pay him installments maturing in his favor after the commencement of the action. It therefore is a matter of no practical importance whether the installments maturing between date of intervention and entry of the judgment be included. But the certificate does not disclose any supplemental petition in respect of such installments, and the judgment should not include them. Hamlin, Hale & Co. v. Race, 78 Ill. 422; Carter-Crume Co. v. Peurrung (C. C. A.) 99 F. 888, 890.\n Section 514, tit. 38, U. S. C. \n1\n (38 USCA  514), provides that, if the designated beneficiary does not survive the insured or dies prior to receiving all of the 240 installments, or all such as are payable and applicable, the present value of the monthly installments thereafter payable shall be paid to the estate of the insured. A judgment for the designated beneficiary for all installments thereafter to mature would not protect the United States against a claim by the estate of the insured for any installments falling due after the death of the beneficiary. The judgment should not govern payment of installments later to mature.\n The question should be answered in the negative.\n\n 3. \nIs interest allowable against the United States upon the monthly installments from the date they are found to be due?\n The rule is that the United States will not be required to pay interest except where the liability is imposed by statute or assumed by contract. An implied agreement to pay interest arises upon a taking by the United States of private property for public use where interest is an element in the just compensation guaranteed by the Constitution. Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. United States, 261 \n\n[281 U.S. 339, 342]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 299, 304, 43 S. Ct. 354. Where the United States came into admiralty to assert a claim as owner pro hac vice of a vessel, it thereby agreed by implication to accept whatever decision the courts might make, and was held liable for interest. United States v. The Thekla, \n266 \nU.S. 328, 339\n, 340 S., 45 S. Ct. 112. And see the Nuestra Senora de Regla, \n108 \nU.S. 92, 104\n, 2 S. Ct. 287; The Paquete Habana, \n189 \nU.S. 453, 465\n, 467 S., 23 S. Ct. 593.\n Appellee relies on Standard Oil Co. v. United States, supra, a libel on war risk insurance policies issued upon an American vessel and its cargo under the War Risk Insurance Act of September 2, 1914, 38 Stat. 711. The United States was held liable for interest upon the ground that (page 79 of 267 U. S., 45 S. Ct. 211, 212): 'When the United States went into the insurance business, issued policies in familiar form and provided that in case of disagreement it might be sued, it must be assumed to have accepted the ordinary incidents of suits in such business. The policies promised that claims would be paid within 30 days after complete proofs of interest and loss. ...'\n The act authorized the Bureau to adopt and publish forms of policies and to establish reasonable rates. The policies adopted by the Bureau and used in that case contained a promise to pay losses within a specified time. Under that form of contract, private underwriters are liable for interest when payment is not made as agreed. There was nothing in the statute to disclose an intention on the part of the United States to bear any part of the cost of the insurance or to give pecuniary aid to the owners of vessels or other property insured. And as a matter of fact a large profit resulted from the operation of the business. Annual Report of the Director of the U. S. Veterans' Bureau, 1923, p. 675.\n On the other hand, the Act of October 6, 1917 (40 Stat. 398), discloses a purpose on the part of the United States to protect \n\n[281 U.S. 339, 343]\n\u00a0\n those engaged in war service and their dependents and to contribute to their financial welfare. It provides for payment by the United States of family allowances in certain cases and of compensation for death or disability of officers, enlisted men, and members of the Army and Navy Nurse Corps in active service resulting from injury or disease contracted in the line of duty. Articles II and III.\n And 'in order to give to every commissioned officer and enlisted man and every member of the Army Nurse Corps (female) and of the Navy Nurse Corps (female) when employed in active service under the War Department or Navy Department greater protection for themselves and their dependents than is provided in Article III,' the United States provided life and disability insurance. Article IV. Its benefits were extended without application therefor to those who were totally and permanently disabled or who died in active service after our entry into the war, April 6, 1917, and prior to the expiration of 120 days after the publication of the terms of the insurance. All such persons were deemed to have applied for and to have been granted insurance. Section 401 (40 Stat. 409). The United States bore expenses of administration and excess mortality and disability cost resulting from the hazards of war. The insurance was limited to $10,000, and was made payable in 240 equal monthly installments; it was made not assignable nor subject to claims of creditors of the insured or of the beneficiary. The premiums were not adequate. The Congress intended that the United States should bear, and undoubtedly it has borne, a large part of the cost. Consequently the payments include both insurance and pension. White v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 175, 180\n, 46 S. Ct. 274.\n The act does not provide for the payment of any interest on past-due installments. It has been uniformly construed by the Bureau not to allow any. There is noth- \n\n[281 U.S. 339, 344]\n\u00a0\n ing in the conduct of the United States in respect of life and disability insurance from which an agreement on its part to pay interest may reasonably be implied.\n This question is not within the principle upon which interest was allowed in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, supra. It should be answered in the negative.\n\n 4. \nMay costs be awarded generally against the United States, upon condition that they be paid from accumulated funds in the hands of the Veterans' Bureau, if any, available for that purpose?\n The rule is that, in the absence of a statute directly authorizing it, courts will not give judgment against the United States for costs or expenses. United States v. Chemical Foundation, \n272 \nU.S. 1, 20\n, 47 S. Ct. 1. There is no statute permitting costs to be awarded against the government in this case.\n The question should be answered in the negative.\n Question 1 is not answered.\n Question 2 is answered 'No.'\n Question 3 is answered 'No.'\n Question 4 is answered 'No.' \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 303, Act of June 7, 1924, 43 Stat. 625 as amended by section 14, Act of March 4, 1925, 43 Stat. 1310. \n\n\n\n\n","140":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNIVERSAL BATTERY CO. v.

Branch, of Providence, R. I., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are cases brought against the United States to recover taxes paid under section 900 of the Revenue Acts of 1918 and 1921, chapter 18, 40 Stat. 1122, and chapter 136, 42 Stat. 291, upon sales of articles which the revenue officers regarded as 'parts or accessories for' motor vehicles the sale of which is subjected to a tax by subdivisions 1 and 2 of that section. In each case the facts were found specially and judgment was given for the defendant. In all this court granted certiorari.\n We pass the details relating to protests, claim to a refund, and administrative denial of those claims, and come directly to the terms of the section under which the taxes were exacted. It provides:\n'Sec. 900. That there shall be levied, assessed, collected, and paid upon the following articles sold or leased by the manufacturer, producer, or importer, a tax equivalent to the following percentages of the price for which so sold or leased-\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 580, 582]\n\u00a0\n '(1) Automobile trucks and automobile wagons, (including tires, inner tubes, parts, and accessories therefor, sold on or in connection therewith or with the sale thereof), 3 per centum;\n'(2) Other automobiles and motorcycles, (including tires, inner tubes, parts, and accessories therefor, sold on or in connection therewith or with the sale thereof), except tractors, 5 per centum;\n\n'(3) Tires, inner tubes, parts, or accessories, for any of the articles enumerated in subdivision (1) or (2), sold to any person other than a manufacturer or producer of any of the articles enumerated in subdivision (1) or (2), 5 per centum.'\n\n The claimants do not manufacture or sell any of the vehicles enumerated in subdivisions 1 and 2, but each does manufacture and sell the article on sales of which the challenged tax was assessed and collected. These sales were all to persons other than a manufacturer or producer of any of the enumerated vehicles. In each case the question presented is whether the article sold is a 'part or accessory for' such a vehicle within the meaning of subdivision 3.\n Taking the three subdivisions together, it is apparent that the words 'parts' and 'accessories' have the same meaning in all; that they comprehend articles having some relation to the enumerated motor vehicles; and that it is because of that relation that the tax is laid on their sale.\n Subdivisions 1 and 2, with the introductory provision, contemplate that parts and accessories may be sold along with the vehicle by the manufacturer of the latter, and show that, where this is done, the tax is to be paid by the manufacturer of the vehicle. Subdivision 3, with the introductory provision, contemplates that parts and accessories may be sold separately from the vehicle by the \n\n[281 U.S. 580, 583]\n\u00a0\n manufacturer of the former to others than a manufacturer of the latter, as where the sale is for replacement purposes, and show that the tax on such a sale is to be paid by the manufacturer of the parts and accessories. And it is implicit in the three subdivisions, with the introductory provision, that, where parts and accessories are sold by their manufacturer to a vehicle manufacturer to be resold along with the vehicle by the latter, the sale by the former is to be tax free, while the resale by the latter, when incidental to the sale of the vehicle, is to be taxed against the latter as already indicated.\n Thus the scheme of taxation embodied in these provisions centers around the motor vehicles enumerated therein. Their sale is the principal thing that is taxed, and the sale of parts and accessories 'for' such vehicles is taxed because the parts and accessories are within the same field with the vehicles and used to the same ends.\n The administrative regulations issued under section 900 uniformly have construed the term 'part' in that section as meaning any article designed or manufactured for the special purpose of being used as, or to replace, a component part of such vehicle, and which by reason of some characteristic is not such a commercial article as ordinarily would be sold for general use, but is primarily adapted for use as a component part of such vehicle. The regulations also have construed the term 'accessory' as meaning any article designed to be used in connection with such vehicle to add to its utility or ornamentation and which is primarily adapted for such use, whether or nor essential to the operation of the vehicle.\n This construction of those terms has been adhered to in the Internal Revenue Bureau for about ten years, and it ought not to be disturbed now unless it be plainly wrong. We think it is not so, but is an admissible construction. Certainly it would be unreasonable to hold \n\n[281 U.S. 580, 584]\n\u00a0\n that articles equally adapted to a variety of uses and commonly put to such uses, one of which is use in motor vehicles, must be classified as parts or accessories for such vehicles. And it would be also unreasonable to hold that articles can be so classified only where they are adapted solely for use in motor vehicles and are exclusively so used. Magone v. Wiederer, \n159 \nU.S. 555, 559\n, 16 S. Ct. 122. We think the view taken in the administrative regulations is reasonable and should be upheld. It is that articles primarily adapted for use in motor vehicles are to be regarded as parts or accessories of such vehicles, even though there has been some other use of the articles for wich they are not so well adapted.\n It remains to apply that view to the cases in hand.\n In No. 127, the claimant was taxed on the sale of storage batteries to divers dealers. In the petition it was alleged that batteries of the type sold were not primarily adapted for use in motor vehicles, but, on the contrary, were, and long had been, used for various other purposes particularly named. This was a material issue; but the court, although finding that the batteries were, and had been for several years, used for the purposes alleged, made no finding as to whether they were primarily adapted for use in motor vehicles or were equally adapted for the the other uses named. There should have been a definite finding on the matter. The other findings are such that, in view of that omission, the judgment should be reversed and the case remanded for complete findings and such further proceedings as may be appropriate.\n In No. 275, the articles sold were storage batteries. There is a special finding that the batteries were of a type specially suitable for use on automobiles as replacements and were not adapted to any other primary purpose or use. With this matter of fact so found the judgment should be affirmed. \n\n[281 U.S. 580, 585]\n\u00a0\n In No. 350, the tax was on sales of gascolaters, a device used on internal combustion engines to strain dirt, water, and foreign matter from the gasoline before it reaches the carburetor. The petition alleged that gascolaters were not parts or accessories of motor vehicles but commercial articles sold for general use and used on various internal conbustion engines other than those in motor vehicles. This was a material issue. The findings make no definite response to it, but leave the matter where conflicting inferences may be drawn respecting it. Because of this, the judgment should be reversed and the case remanded for definite and complete findings and such further proceedings as may be appropriate.\n In No. 351, the articles sold were gears, flexible shafts, and flexible housings, all being replacement parts for speedometers used on motor vehicles. It is conceded that speedometers are accessories; but it is insisted that parts of a speedometer cannot be such. We think they can. The finding is that these parts were specially designed, manufactured and sold for use on automobiles and are not adapted to any other purpose or use. It is not questioned that when sold they had reached such a stage of manufacture that they were adapted for ready replacement and use; so it is not as if the process of manufacture were not complete. A speedometer consists of distinct and separate parts, and we perceive no reason why one or more of these, when manufactured and sold for the purpose shown by the finding, should not take the same classification as speedometers. The judgment should be affirmed.\n In No. 352, the tax was laid on sales of bars, brackets, and fittings for use as replacement parts for bumpers on automobiles. They were designed, manufactured, and sold for such use, and were not adapted for any other. It is said that, while bumpers are accessories, these parts can not \n\n[281 U.S. 580, 586]\n\u00a0\n be so regarded. We think they are on the same plane as the parts of speedometers just dealt with. The judgment should be affirmed.\n In Nos. 127 and 350, judgments reversed and cases remanded for further findings.\n In Nos. 275, 351, and 352, judgments affirmed. \n\n\n\n","141":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWABASH RY.

From 1915 to 1926 there were net earnings on most of the years but for a number of years no dividend, or less than five per cent., was paid on Class A, while $16,000, 000 net earnings that could have been used for the payment were expended upon improvements and additions to the property and equipment of the road. It is not denied that the latter expenditures were proper and were made in good faith, or that the money could not have been applied to dividends consistently with the duties of the Road. The Company now is more prosperous and proposes to pay dividends not only upon A but also on B and the common stock, but the plaintiffs say that it is not entitled to do so until it has paid to them unpaid preferential dividends for prior fiscal years in which it had net earnings that might have been applied to them but were not.\n The obligations assumed by the Company appear in its instrument of incorporation and in the certificates of Preferred Stock A in substantially the same words 'The holders of the Five Per Cent. Profit Sharing Preferred Stock A of the Company shall be entitled to receive preferential dividends in each fiscal year up to the amount of five per cent. before any dividends shall be paid upon any other stock of the Company, but such preferential dividends shall be non-cumulative.' In the event of a liquidation the holders 'shall be entitled to be paid in full out \n\n[280 U.S. 197, 203]\n\u00a0\n of the assets of the Company the par amount of their stock and all dividends thereon declared and unpaid before any amount shall be paid out of said assets to the holders of any other stock of the Company.' By the plain meaning of the words the holders 'are not entitled, of right, to dividends, payable out of the net profits accruing in any particular year, unless the directors of the Company formally declare, or ought to declare, a dividend payable out of such profits'; in the first instance at least a matter for the directors to determine. New York, Lake Erie & Western R. R. Co. v. Nickals, \n119 \nU.S. 296, 307\n, 7 S. Ct. 209.\n We believe that it has been the common understanding of lawyers and business men that in the case of non-cumulative stock entitled only to a dividend if declared out of annual profits, if those profits are justifiably applied by the directors to capital improvements and no dividend is declared within the year, the claim for that year is gone and cannot be asserted at a later date. But recently doubts have been raised that seem to have affected the minds of the majority below. We suppose the ground for the doubts is the probability that the directors will be tempted to abuse their power, in the usual case of a corporation controlled by the holders of the common stock. Their interest would lead them to apply earnings to improvement of the capital rather than to make avoidable payments of dividends which they do not share. But whether the remedies available in case of such a breach of duty are adequate or not, and apart from the fact that the control of the Wabash seems to have been in Glass A, the class to which the plaintiffs belong, the law, as remarked by the dissenting Judge below, 'has long advised them that their rights depend upon the judgment of men subject to just that possible bias.'\n When a man buys stock instead of bonds he takes a greater risk in the business. No one suggests that he has a right to dividends if there are no net earnings. But the \n\n[280 U.S. 197, 204]\n\u00a0\n investment presupposes that the business is to go on, and therefore even if there are net earnings, the holder of stock, preferred as well as common, is entitled to have a dividend declared only out of such part of them as can be applied to dividends consistently with a wise administration of a going concern. When, as was the case here, the dividends in each fiscal year were declared to be non-cumulative and no net income could be so applied within the fiscal year referred to in the certificate, the right for that year was gone. If the right is extended further upon some conception of policy, it is enlarged beyond the meaning of the contract and the common and reasonable understanding of men.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWAMPLER v. LECOMPTE(1930)\nNo. 402\nArgued: November 25, 1930Decided: December 8, 1930\n\n\n\n Mr. T. Morris Wampler, of Washington, D. C., for appellant. \n\n[282 U.S. 172, 173]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Archer and William L. Marbury, Jr., Asst. Attys. Gen., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The game laws of Maryland provide for granting annual licenses for the erection and maintenance of duck blinds in the waters of the State. No blind may be placed at a greater distance from the natural shore than 300 yards; and blinds must be at least 500 yards apart. A preferential right to select the position for a blind is conferred upon the riparian owner; but he may not place a blind 'within 250 yards of the dividing line of any property owned by him and the adjoining property bordering on said waters ... unless with the consent of the adjoining landowner.' For certain waters the limitations prescribed are different from those above stated. In some, permission to erect a blind is wholly denied. For others, existing licenses are made renewable without condition. Code of Public General Laws of Maryland (Supp. 1929), Article 99,  40-47.\n Wampler, a resident of Charles county, owns land bordering on the Potomac river for a distance of less than 44 feet. Claiming to act under a license issued to him in June, 1929, he erected a duck blind at a point within 250 yards of the dividing line of his land and that of the adjoining owners on both the north and the south. Game wardens, acting pursuant to the statutes, destroyed Wampler's blind as being an illegal structure; and they threatened to destroy any other blind which he might erect under like conditions. To enjoin such action Wampler brought this suit against them in a state court. He conceded that the State has power to prohibit altogether the erection of blinds or to regulate their erection and \n\n[282 U.S. 172, 174]\n\u00a0\n maintenance. \n1\n His sole claim is that this statute violates the equality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because it discriminates in favor of riparian owners with a frontag of more than 500 yards; and also because it does not apply uniformly to all the waters of the State. The hearing was on bill and answer. The trial court dismissed the bill on the merits. Its decree was affirmed by the highest court of the State. 150 A. 455.\n No fact is shown on which to base the contention that the State's power of classification has been exercised unreasonably. The purpose of the legislation is, as the court found, 'the conservation of water fowl and the protection and safety of those engaged in shooting them. The necessity for such regulation is apparent, for, if blinds could be erected in broad waters at any distance from the shore without regard to the distance separating them, it would not only be conducive to the destruction and annihilation of ducks and other water fowl, but extremely dangerous to those shooting them.' 150 A. 457. The provision which prohibits placing a blind within 250 yards of the land of an adjoining owner without securing his consent is a necessary incident of the preferential right conferred upon riparian owners. See Sheehy v. Thomas, 155 Md. 688, 142 A. 506. There was obviously no intention to discriminate in favor of persons having a large water frontage; for the consent provision enables owners of small frontages to join in erecting blinds spaced the requisite distance apart.\n Nor is the equality clause violated by the special provisions that in certain inland waters blinds need not be placed farther apart than 250 yards. The state court, relying upon Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 \n\n[282 U.S. 172, 175]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 61, 78, 31 S. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160, said: 'Why these provisions were inserted in the statute we are not informed, but we may assume, until the contrary is shown, that a state of facts in respect thereto existed which warranted the Legislature in so legislating.' 150 A. 458. This long-settled rule disposes also of the alleged discrimination created by the special exemptions applicable to certain other waters of the State. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Smith v.

Fyffe, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Bayard Lacey Catron, of Springfield, Ill., for respondent. \n\n[281 U.S. 511, 512]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a Delaware corporation licensed to do business in Illinois, brought this suit in the circuit court of Sangamon county to enjoin payment to the state treasurer of the amount of a license fee or franchise tax that respondent as secretary of state collected from petitioner under section 105 of the General Corporation Act of that state ( Smith-Hurd Rev. St. Ill. 1929, c. 32,  105). The suit was based upon the claim that, as construed and enforced by respondent, the section violates the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. Article 1,  8, cl. 3. After hearing upon bill, answer, and an agreed statement of facts, the court dismissed the bill. The State Supreme Court (335 Ill. 150, 166 N. E. 501) affirmed the decree following our decision in Hump Hairpin Co. v. Emmerson, \n258 \nU.S. 290\n, 42 S. Ct. 305, which affirmed 293 Ill. 387, 127 N. E. 746.\n Section 105 provides: 'Each corporation for profit, ... except insurance companies, ... organized under the laws of this State or admitted to do business in this State, ... shall pay an annual license fee or franchise tax ... of five cents on each one hundred dollars of the proportion of its issued capital stock ... represented by business transacted and property located in this State. ...'\n Petitioner operates factories and has its principal office in Illinois. It there receives, upon forms furnished by it, orders for its products from persons in Illinois and elsewhere and by sending written acceptance consummates contracts of sale. In accordance with the directions contained in the orders, petitioner delivers the goods at its factories to common carriers for transportation to purchasers at various destinations in Illinois, other states, and foreign countries.\n Petitioner had issued capital stock of the par value of $5,701,800; it had property valued at $6,924,804.92, of \n\n[281 U.S. 511, 513]\n\u00a0\n which $6,894,903.27 was situated in Illinois; its business for the year in question amounted to $11,670,925.51, of which $1,919,822.73 represented products shipped to purchasers in Illinois; and.$9,751,042.78, reported as interstate commerce, was made up of shipments to customers outside the state.\n Respondent treated all of petitioner's business as having been transacted in Illinois and based the tax on such proportion of its outstanding capital stock as its business plus its Illinois property was of such business and all its property. The tax so calculated amounted to $ 2,808.03, a substantial part of which resulted from the inclusion of the transactions reported by petitioner as interstate commerce.\n All of the goods sold were manufactured by the petitioner in Illinois and the manufacturing was business carried on in that State. The receipt and acceptance of orders, the packing, giving shipping directions, and delivery to common carriers also constituted business in that state; these things were common to all sales whether the goods sold were sent to destinations within or without the state, but as to products shipped to other States or foreign countries the acceptance of orders and what was subsequently done by petitioner became component parts of interstate or foreign commerce.

Ct. 233; Federal Trade Commission v. Pacific Paper Ass'n, \n273 U.S. 52\n, 63-64, 47 S. Ct. 255.\n Unquestionably Illinois has power to tax all petitioner's property therein without regard to its use in connection with interstate transactions and to impose a license fee or excise upon petitioner's local business. International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 135, 141\n, 38 S. Ct. 292, Ann. Cas. 1918C 617. The tax in question was not laid directly upon interstate commerce or any of its elements. For the determination of \n\n[281 U.S. 511, 514]\n\u00a0\n the amount the taxpayer's business and property located in Illinois is divided by the total of all its business and property and that percentage is applied to the issued shares and the resulting number taken for taxation at the rate of 5 cents per $100. As the amount depends on the relation each to the others of the various elements employed in the calculation, the fee or tax does not directly depend upon the amount of the taxpayer's interstate transactions. The exaction may rise while the sales to customers outside Illinois decline and may fall while such sales increase.\n The amount imposed upon petitioner did not even indirectly burden the interstate transportation resulting from the shipping directions given by petitioner in fulfillment of its contracts of sale. There is nothing to indicate that by the enactment in question the state intended to regulate or burden such commerce or to discriminate as between sales to Illinois customers and those made to buyers in other states and countries. The tax cannot be said directly or by necessary operation to affect any of the things done by petitioner which, by reason of transportation of goods to places outside Illinois in accordance with the directions of the purchasers, became elements or component parts of interstate or foreign commerce. Petitioner's sales prices are based on deliveries to common carriers at its factories. The expense of transportation is not involved in the calculation. And it is plain that, if the fee or tax in question affected petitioner's interstate or foreign commerce at all, the burden was indirect and remote and not a violation of the commerce clause.\n The petitioner relies on Air-way Corp. v. Day, \n266 \nU.S. 71\n, 45 S. Ct. 12. But, as shown by the opinion, the tax considered in that case was based on the authorized capital stock and the rate was applied to a number of shares greatly in excess of the total of all that had been issued. The com- \n\n[281 U.S. 511, 515]\n\u00a0\n pany was authorized to issue 400,000 shares; it had issued only 50,485 and these represented all its property and business. The tax at the rate of five cents each on 298,520 shares was held directly to burden the company's interstate commerce. Cf. Cudahy Co. v. Hinkle, \n278 \nU.S. 460\n, 49 S. Ct. 204.

UNITED STATES(1930)\nNo. 15\nArgued: April 25, 1929Decided: May 26, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 572, 573]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Jesse I. Miller, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff.\n The Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Court of Claims has certified to us a question concerning which it desires instruction for the proper disposition of the aboveentitled cause now pending before it. Late in the last term we dismissed the certificate in the belief that the question propounded embraces the whole case, and so could not be answered consistently with the applicable statute or with the constitutional limitations on our jurisdiction. But before the term closed we vacated the order of dismissal (\n279 \nU.S. 826\n, 49 S. Ct. 515) and held the matter for further consideration.\n The facts shown in the certificate are as follows: In the years 1918, 1919, 1920, and 1921, the plaintiff, a corporate dealer in bridge materials, engaged to sell and \n\n[281 U.S. 572, 574]\n\u00a0\n deliver to each of several counties in the States of Iowa and Nebraska a quantity of lumber, which in each instance was needed and used by the purchasing county in the construction or repair of bridges along public highways within the county. The plaintiff was to ship the lumber from places outside the State to designated points within the purchasing county and there deliver the same to the county f. o. b. at stated prices. The plaintiff fulfilled its engagement as made. The shipping was done by railroad under bills of lading calling for delivery by the carrier to the plaintiff, or on its order, at destination. The plaintiff forwarded the bills of lading to the county clerk; and when the shipments reached their destination the county clerk, acting for the county and conforming to the plaintiff's intention, presented the bills of lading to the carrier, paid the transportation charges, accepted the lumber, deducted the transportation charges from the stipulated f. o. b. price, and remitted the balance to the plaintiff.\n The federal revenue laws in force at the time imposed on the transportation of freight by rail or water a tax of 3 per cent. of the amount paid for that service; required that the tax be paid 'by the person paying for the service'; and authorized the carrier to collect the tax on behalf of the government; but declared that transportation service rendered to a State should be exempt from the tax. Revenue Act 1917, c. 63 ,  500, 501, 502, 503, 40 Stat. 300, 314, 315; Revenue Act 1918, c. 18 ,  500(a) and (h), 501(a), 502, 40 Stat. 1057, 1101, 1102, 1103. In the administrative regulations issued under those laws the exemption of transportation service to a State was construed as including such service to her 'political subdivisions, such as counties, cities, towns, and other municipalities.'\n No tax on the transportation service was demanded or paid when the transportation charges were paid. But \n\n[281 U.S. 572, 575]\n\u00a0\n thereafter the Collector of Internal Revenue assessed such a tax against the plaintiff and the plaintiff paid it under protest. Application was then made by the plaintiff to have the amount refunded; but the application was denied by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n The suit in the Court of Claims was brought by the plaintiff against the United States to recover the amount collected on the tax; that exaction being assailed on two grounds: One that the transportation service was rendered to the purchasing counties, and therefore was exempt from the tax, and the other that, as the counties paid the carrier its transportation charges, the liability, if any, for the tax did not attach to the plaintiff.\n The certificate further shows that the court referred the case to a commissioner who, in accord with the reference, reported special findings of fact; and that both parties conceded the correctness and accuracy of the report. In making the certificate the court accepted and summarized the facts reported by its commissioner.\n The question certified, somewhat shortened in words but not altered in substance, is-\n Where a vendor, who has engaged to sell and deliver lumber needed for public bridges to a county at a designated point in the county f. o. b. at a stated price, ships the lumber by rail to that point preparatory to there effecting the required delivery and forwards the bills of lading to the county, and the latter, conformably to the vendor's intention, surrenders the bills of lading to the carrier, pays its transportation charges, receives the lumber from it, deducts from the f. o. b. price at destination the transportation charges paid to the carrier, and remits the balance to the vendor-is the transportation of the lumber to the place of delivery a service rendered to the county (State) within the meaning of the exempting provisions of section 502 of the Revenue Act of 1917 and section 500(h) of the Revenue Act of 1918, and within the principle \n\n[281 U.S. 572, 576]\n\u00a0\n recognized and applied in Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi, \n277 \nU.S. 218\n, 48 S. Ct. 451, 56 A. L. R. 583?\n The statute providing for certification of questions by the Court of Claims is section 3(a) of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 939 (28 USCA  288(a), which reads:\n'That in any case in the Court of Claims, including those begun under section 180 of the Judicial Code, that court at any time may certify to the Supreme Court any definite and distinct questions of law concerning which instructions are desired for the proper disposition of the cause; and thereupon the Supreme Court may give appropriate instructions on the questions certified and transmit the same to the Court of Claims for its guidance in the further progress of the cause.'\n\n This is a new provision. Similar provisions have permitted particular federal courts to certify questions to this Court, but this provision is the first giving such authority to the Court of Claims.\n There are two reasons why a certification by that court which embraces the whole case cannot be entertained by this Court. One is that to accept such a certification and proceed to a determination thereon, in advance of a decision by that Court, would be an exercise of original jurisdiction by this Court contrary to the constitutional provision which prescribes that its jurisdiction shall be appellate in all cases other than those affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a State shall be a party. Article 3,  2, cl. 2. The other is that the statute permits a certification only of 'definite and distinct questions of law.'\n Even the restricted certification permitted by the statute invokes action which is rather exceptional in the appellate field. But that such action is appellate is now settled. Early and long-continued usage amounting to a practical construction of the constitutional provision requires that it be so regarded. \n\n[281 U.S. 572, 577]\n\u00a0\n In section 6 of the Act of April 29, 1802, c. 31, 2 Stat. 156, Congress made provision for restricted certifications from the circuit courts to this Court in advance of a decision by the former. That provision remained in force and was given effect for seventy years. Many certifications in both civil and criminal cases were entertained and dealt with under it. Indeed, it was the only mode in which questions of law in cases of several classes could be brought to this Court during that period.\n But in exercising that jurisdiction this Court uniformly ruled that it could not entertain the certifications unless they were of distinct questions of law and not of the whole case, for otherwise it would be assuming original jurisdiction withheld from it by the Constitution. White v. Turk, 12 Pet. 238, 239; United States v. Stone, 14 Pet. 524, 525; Nesmith v. Sheldon, 6 How. 41, 43; Webster v. Cooper, 10 How. 54, 55; The Alicia, 7 Wall. 571, 573; United States v. Perrin, \n131 \nU.S. 55, 58\n, 9 S. Ct. 681; Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n215 \nU.S. 216, 224\n, 30 S. Ct. 86.\n And in applying the provision of 1802 and other later provisions permitting certifications, this Court, while holding, on the one hand, that it cannot be required through certifications thereunder to pass upon questions of fact, or mixed questions of law and fact, or to accept a transfer of the whole case; or to answer questions of objectionable generality-which instead of presenting distinct propositions of law cover unstated matters lurking in the record-or questions that are hypothetical and speculative, has distinctly held, on the other hand, that the certification of a definite question of law is not rendered objectionable merely because the answer may be decisive of the case, and also that the importance or controlling character of the question certified, if it be a question of law and suitably specific, affords no ground for declining \n\n[281 U.S. 572, 578]\n\u00a0\n to accept the certification. United States v. Mayer, \n235 \nU.S. 55, 66\n, 35 S. Ct. 16, and cases cited.\n The practice and rulings just described are equally applicable to certifications under the provision relating to the Court of Claims.\n Upon further consideration of the present certificate in the light of that practice and those rulings, we are of opinion that the certificate is not open to any valid objection and should be entertained. The question certified is a distinct and definite question of law and its materiality is adequately shown. Neither in form nor in effect does it embrace the whole case. It does not include any question of fact, but, on the contrary, treats the facts as fully ascertained and definitely states those out of which it arises. No doubt, with these facts ascertained, an affirmative answer to the question would be decisive of the case. But if the answer were in the negative the case would be left where another question of law raised by the plaintiff's petition and mooted in the Court of Claims, but not certified, would need to be resolved by that Court before a judgment could be given.\n We thus are brought to the solution of the certified question. Counsel for the government concede, and rightly so, that the exemption accorded to a State by section 502 of the Revenue Act of 1917 and section 500(h) of the Revenue Act of 1918 should be construed as extending to her counties, as is done in the administrative regulations. The Court of Claims, evidently entertaining this view of the exemption, inquires whether the transportation described in the question is a service rendered to the county within the meaning of those sections. The transportation is had at the vendor's instance and is his means of getting his lumber to the place of sale and delivery. He engages to deliver f. o. b., not at the place of shipment, but at the place of destination, which is \n\n[281 U.S. 572, 579]\n\u00a0\n the place of sale and delivery. There is no delivery, and therefore no sale, until after the transportation is completed. Upon these facts, recited in the question, we are of opinion that the transportation is not a service rendered to the county in the sense of the sections cited, but is a service rendered to the vendor. Conceding that the sections are parts of a taxing scheme, and assuming that they are intended to recognize and fully respect the constitutional immunity of a state agency, such as a county, from federal taxation, we think they neither require such transportation to be regarded as a service to the county nor operate to exempt such transportation from the tax.\n The tax is not laid on the sale nor because of the sale. It is laid on the transportation and is measured by the transportation charges. True, it appears that here the transportation was had with a view to a definite sale; but the fact remains that transportation was not part of the sale but preliminary to it and wholly the vendor's affair. United States v. Normile, \n239 \nU.S. 344, 348\n, 36 S. Ct. 122. It follows that the tax on the transportation cannot be regarded as a tax or burden on the sale. Cornell v. Coyne, \n192 \nU.S. 418\n, 24 S. Ct. 383.\n As the tax is not laid on the sale or in any wise measured by it, the case of Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi, \n277 \nU.S. 218\n, 48 S. Ct. 451, 56 A. L. R. 583, referred to in the question and relied on by the plaintiff, is not in point.\n Question Answered 'No.' \n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWHITE v.

Thereupon, the bill alleges, the board of commissioners, on October 11, 1928, 'wrongfully entered upon the said real property of plaintiffs (appellees) and converted the personal property thereon to their own use, and have since remained in possession of said real and personal property and prevented its use, enjoyment, occupation, and operation by plaintiffs for any purpose to plaintiffs' great and continuing damage.'\n It is further averred that the sum of $500,000 was allocated to the acquisition of the property, but that the value of the property exceeds $3, 000,000; that appellees are suffering daily loss from the 'continued unlawful occupation of their property,' the aggregate sum of which will be such that the damage will be irreparable and destructive of appellees' property; and that, therefore, they are without adequate remedy at law.\n The prayer is that the acts of the board and state officers, and the statutes of the state purporting to authorize them, be declared invalid as violating the Fourteenth Amendment and other provisions of the federal Constitution, as well as a provision of the state Constitution; and that appellants be enjoined from attempting to enforce the provisions of the statute, notice, description, or certificate, or proceeding against appellees at law or in equity to compel compliance with, or inflicting or recovering any penalty, forfeiture, or damage for noncompliance by appellees with the statute, notice, description, or certificate, or 'from continuing in possession of plaintiffs' said property.'\n The statutory provisions assailed as unconstitutional are found in sections 59 and 761 of the New York Conservation \n\n[280 U.S. 500, 508]\n\u00a0\n Law (Laws 1928, c. 242). Section 761 confers upon the commissioners of the Palisades Interstate Park power to acquire lands by entry and appropriation in the manner provided for in section 59. Section 59 authorizes the conservation department to enter upon and take possession of lands, etc., which, in the judgment of the department, shall be necessary for public park purposes, or for the protection and conservation of the lands, forests, and waters within the state. A description of the property to be entered upon must be made and certified, which, together with a notice indorsed thereon that the property described is appropriated by the people of the state, shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state. A duplicate must be served on the owner or owners of the lands, etc., and 'thereupon such property shall become, and be, the property of the people of the state.' Provision is made for an adjustment of compensation for the property and legal damages, and the issue of a certificate stating the amount due; which amount shall be paid out of the state treasury upon the audit and warrant of the Comptroller. It is further provided that any owner may present to the state Court of Claims a claim for the value of the land and damages; and the court is authorized to hear and determine such claim and render judgment thereon. The Comptroller is directed to issue his warrant for the payment of the amount, with interest from the date of the judgment until the 30th day after the entry of final judgment; and such amount shall be paid out of the state treasury.\n Upon filing the bill it was ordered that appellants show cause before a court of three judges, constituted under section 266 of the Judicial Code (U. S. C. tit. 28,  380 (28 USCA  380)), why an interlocutory injunction should not issue. A hearing was had upon affidavits submitted by both parties. The affidavit of James G. Shaw, on behalf of appellees, con- \n\n[280 U.S. 500, 509]\n\u00a0\n tains the statement that, acting under the statutory provisions above set forth, the property in question was 'appropriated by the people of the state of New York for public and state park purposes with the approval of the Governor'; and that the commissioners 'thereafter entered upon the took possession of said property, of which they have since retained possession to the exclusion of the plaintiffs.' The affidavit of J. Du Pratt White, president of the board of commissioners of the Palisades Interstate Park, sets forth that, after the appropriation papers were served, appellees ceased doing any work on the property; that the contractors and other persons engaged in doing work left, taking their machinery and tools with them, and certain movable property and equipment used or for use in connection therewith was likewise removed from the premises; and that the state, through the commission, had, since October 11, 1928, been in exclusive possession of the property as a state park. These excerpts from the affidavits are not controverted.\n Appellants submitted a motion to dismiss the bill on the ground, among others, that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a valid cause of action in equity against the defendants. The court below denied the motion to dismiss, and granted an interlocutory injunction in accordance with the prayer of the bill. The state statute was held invalid, for the reason that it authorized the taking of private property for public use without just compensation, or making adequate provision for payment thereof. In respect of its denial of the motion to dismiss, the court simply said that the action was not one for ejectment, and cited Hopkins v. Clemson Agricultural College, \n221 \nU.S. 636\n, 31 S. Ct. 654, 35 L. R. A. (N. S.) 243; United States Freehold Land & Emigration Co. v. Gallegos (C. C. A.) 89 F. 769.\n We do not consider the question of the constitutionality of the state legislation, because it is apparent from the \n\n[280 U.S. 500, 510]\n\u00a0\n bill and affidavits that the bill should have been dismissed on the ground that appellees had an adequate remedy at law.\n The board of commissioners, acting for the state, entered upon the lands and had been in the exclusive possession thereof for several months before the filing of the bill, effectively preventing appellees from using, enjoying, or occupying the property. The relief sought was to enjoin appellants 'from continuing in possession,' that is to say, to oust appellants so as to restore the lands to the possession of appellees. It is plain that this is not the office of an injunction. Entry and possession of the lands by appellants and all alleged wrongful acts and proceedings preliminary thereto and in aid thereof had been consummated long before suit was brought, and preventive relief by injunction, consequently, had ceased to be appropriate.\n Whitehead v. Shattuck, \n138 \nU.S. 146\n, 11 S. Ct. 276, was a suit in equity to quiet title to real property. Plaintiff was the owner in fee, holding title as trustee. Defendants claimed title and were in possession, openly and adversely. Plaintiff averred that defendants' claim of title was made in fraud of his right; that the patent under which they claimed was fraudulently made, the land not being subject to entry and patent. Upon these facts, this court held that plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law, and that a suit in equity could not be sustained, saying (page 151 of 138 U. S., 11 S. Ct. 276, 277):\n'... Where an action is simply for the recovery and possession of specific, real, or personal property, or for the recovery of a money judgment, the action is one at law. An action for the recovery of real property, including damages for withholding it, has always been of that class. The right which in this case the plaintiff wishes to assert is his title to certain real property; the remedy which he wishes to obtain is its possession and enjoyment; and in a \n\n[280 U.S. 500, 511]\n\u00a0\n contest over the title both parties have a constitutional right to call for a jury.'\n\n In Lacassagne v. Chapuis, \n144 \nU.S. 119, 124\n, 12 S. Ct. 659, 661, this court said:\n'The plaintiff was out of possession when he instituted this suit, and by the prayer of this bill he attempts to regain possession by means of the injunction asked for. In other words, the effort is to restore the plaintiff, by injunction, to rights of which he had been deprived. The function of an injunction is to afford preventive relief, not to redress alleged wrongs which have been committed already. An injunction will not be used to take property out of the possession of one party and put it into that of another. I High, Inj. ( 2d Ed.)  355.'\n\n To the same effect is United States v. Wilson, \n118 \nU.S. 86, 89\n, 6 S. Ct. 991; Black v. Jackson, \n177 \nU.S. 349, 361\n, 20 S. Ct. 648. In the latter case the rule was applied, notwithstanding the financial inability of the defendant to respond in damages.\n The two cases cited by the court below are not in point. In Hopkins v. Clemson Agricultural College, supra, plaintiff sued for damages caused by erection of a dike on one side of a river, which had the effect of submerging his lands lying wholly upon the other side. The injury was 'continuous from day to day and year to year.' The prayer was for damages, and abatement and removal of the dike. The injury was in the nature of a continuing treaspass; possession was neither involved nor sought.\n In United States Freehold Land & Emigration Co. v. Gallegos, supra, the bill was to enjoin the diversion of water to the injury of complainant's lands, constituting a continuing trespass. The ownership or possession of the lands was not in controversy.\n The present case is entirely different. Here the purpose of the suit is to eject appellants from lands which for five months had been and still were in their exclusive \n\n[280 U.S. 500, 512]\n\u00a0\n possession, under claim of right and in pursuance of a statute which gives color of title, notwithstanding the challenge to its constitutionality. See Doe ex dem. Trustees, etc. v. Trustees of Newbern Academy, 9 N. C. 233. That challenge does not require resort to a suit in equity. It will be open for determination in an action at law which is the appropriate remedy.\n The decree below must be reversed, and the cause remanded, with instructions to dismiss the bill, but without prejudice to an action at law in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n Section 274a of the Judicial Code, U. S. C. tit. 28,  397, (28 USCA  397) and rule 22 of the Equity Rules, 226 U. S. appendix, 6 (28 USCA  723, p. 16), contemplate that, where what is really an action at law is erroneously begun as a suit in equity, the same may be transferred to the law side of the court and after appropriate amendments may be prosecuted to a judgment as if originally begun on the law side. See Liberty Oil Co. v. Condon National Bank, \n260 \nU.S. 235\n, 43 S. Ct. 118; Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Grannis, \n273 \nU.S. 70, 76\n, 47 S. Ct. 282; Twist v. Prairie Oil & Gas Co., \n274 \nU.S. 684, 689\n, 692 S., 47 S. Ct. 755. But both the statute and the equity rule refer, and can only refer, to cases of which the court would have jurisdiction if they were brought on its law side. This is not such a case. The parties are citizens, not of different states, but of the same state. And if the plaintiffs were suing at law in ejectment, their complaint, if confined to an orderly statement of such a cause of action, without anticipating possible defenses, would not present a case arising under the Constitution, or a treaty or law of the United States. Taylor v. Anderson, \n234 \nU.S. 74\n, 34 S. Ct. 724. Thus the case, if brought as an action at law, would be one of which a federal district court would not have jurisdiction. In this situation no other course is open than to direct that the bill be dismissed and leave the plaintiffs free to sue in a state court, if they be so advised.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","146":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILBUR v. UNITED STATES(1930)\nNo. 63\nArgued: December 6, 1929Decided: January 6, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 306, 307]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. George C. Butte, of San Juan, Porto Rico, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[280 U.S. 306, 311]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Chester I. Long, of Wichita, Kan., and Langdon H. Larwell and Charles S. Thomas, both of Denver, Colo., for respondent.\n\n\n[280 U.S. 306, 314]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The disposition of this case depends upon the construction and application of section 2324 R. S. (U. S. C. title 30,  28 (30 USCA  28)), and the effect upon its provisions of section 37 of the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, c. 85, 41 Stat. 437, 451 (U. S. C. title 30,  193 (30 USCA  193)). Section 2324 R. S., which has its origin in section 5 of the Mining Act of 1872 (c. 152, 17 Stat. 91, 92 (30 USCA  28)), provides:\n'On each claim located after the 10th day of May, 1872, and until a patent has been issued therefor, not less than $100 worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made during each year. ... and upon a failure to comply with these conditions, the claim or mine upon which such failure occurred shall be open to relocation in the same manner as if no location of the same had ever been made, provided that the original locators, their heirs, assigns, or legal representatives, have not resumed work upon the claim after failure and before such location.'\n\n By section 2325, R. S. (U. S. C. title 30,  29 (30 USCA  29)), provision is made for issuing patents for claims located under the mining laws. One of the prerequisites, and the only one in respect of labor, is that the claimant must show 'that $500 worth of labor has been expended or improvements made upon the claim by himself or grantors.'\n The Leasing Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 437) effected a complete change of policy in respect of the disposition of lands containing deposits of coal, phosphate, sodium, oil, oil shale, and gas. Such lands were no longer to be open to location and acquisition of title, but only to lease. But section 37 (U. S. C. title 30,  193 (30 USCA  193)) contains a saving clause protecting 'valid claims existent at date of the passage of this Act and \n\n[280 U.S. 306, 315]\n\u00a0\n thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated,' and declaring that they 'may be perfected under such laws, including discovery.'\n On October 1, 1919, respondent and seven associates, all qualified under the law, located a tract of land in Garfield county, Colo., under the name of Spad No. 3 placer claim. The land contained valuable deposits of oil shale, and was open to appropriation under the mining laws of the United States. Spad No. 3 placer claim formed one of a group of six oil placer claims, numbered Spad No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively, all located and owned by the same persons, and lying adjacent to each other. The assessment year 1920, at act of Congress, was extended until July 1, 1921. Prior to that date, annual labor amounting in value, it was asserted, to more than $600 was performed on claims numbered 4, 5, and 6, with the intention that said labor should apply to the entire group.\n Subsequently, respondent acquired the interest of his colocators in the Spad No. 3, and, during and for the assessment year 1921, performed thereon assessment labor of an admitted value of more than $100, and continued to perform labor and make improvements on the claim until the aggregate value exceeded $500. On September 25, 1922, he applied for a patent, and, having complied with the statutory requirements and paid the purchase price, obtained final receiver's receipt on December 16, 1922. No relocation of the claim was ever attempted, nor was the valid existence or maintenance of the claim ever challenged in any wise by the United States, or by any one, prior to the issue of the receiver's receipt. Thereafter, a proceeding against the entry was instituted by the Commissioner of the General Land Office; and that officer, after consideration, held the claim null and void upon the sole ground of insufficient assessment labor for the year 1920. This holding was affirmed by the Secretary of the Interior. \n\n[280 U.S. 306, 316]\n\u00a0\n In all the proceedings before the land officers amd the Secretary, it was conceded, as it is here conceded, that the claim was valid and existent when the Leasing Act was passed; and that no reason existed, or now exists, for withholding a patent, save the alleged failure of assessment labor for the assessment year 1920. The Secretary held that by such failure all rights to the claim became extinguished and could not be saved or revived by a resumption of work.\n Thereupon, respondent applied by petition to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for a writ of mandamus to compel the Secretary to issue a patent to the claim. After a hearing on rule to show cause, that court discharged the rule and dismissed the petition. Upon appeal this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the District. 58 App. D. C. 332, 30 F.(2d) 742.\n Two questions are presented for determination: (1) Did the Leasing Act of 1920 have the effect of extinguishing the right of the locator, under section 2324 (30 USCA  28), to save his claim under the original location by resuming work after failure to perform annual assessment labor ? (2) Is the case a proper one for the writ of mandamus?\n\n 1. \nThe rule is established by innumerable decisions of this Court, and of state and lower federal courts, that, when the location of a mining claim is perfected under the law, it has the effect of a grant by the United States of the right of present and exclusive possession. The claim is property in the fullest sense of that term; and may be sold, transferred, mortgaged, and inherited without infringing any right or title of the United States. The right of the owner is taxable by the state; and is 'real property,' subject to the lien of a judgment recovered against the owner in a state or territorial court. Belk v. Meagher, \n104 U.S. 279\n, 283; Manuel v. Wulff, \n152 U.S. 505\n, 510-511, 14 S. Ct. 651; Elder v. Wood, \n208 U.S. 226\n, \n\n[280 U.S. 306, 317]\n\u00a0\n 232, 28 S. Ct. 263; Bradford v. Morrison, \n212 \nU.S. 389\n, 29 S. Ct. 349. The owner is not required to purchase the claim or secure patent from the United States; but, so long as he complies with the provisions of the mining laws, his possessory right, for all practical purposes of ownership, is as good as though secured by patent. While he is required to perform labor of the value of $100 annully, a failure to do so does not ipso facto forfeit the claim, but only renders it subject to loss by relocation. And the law is clear that no relocation can be made if work be resumed after default and before such relocation.\n Prior to the passage of the Leasing Act, annual performance of labor was not necessary to preserve the possessory right, with all the incidents of ownership above stated, as against the United States, but only as against subsequent relocators. So far as the government was concerned, failure to do assessment work for any year was without effect. Whenever $ 500 worth of labor in the aggregate had been performed, other requirements aside, the owner became entitled to a patent, even though in some years annual assessment labor had been omitted. P. Wolenberg et al., 29 L. D. 302, 304; Nielson v. Champagne Mining and Milling Co., 29 L. D. 491, 493.\n It being conceded that the Spad No. 3 'was a valid claim existent on February 25, 1920,' the only question is whether, within the terms of the excepting clause of section 37 (30 USCA  193), the claim was 'thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated.' These words are plain and explicit, and we have only to expound them according to their obvious and natural sense.\n It is not doubted that a claim initiated under section 2324, R. S., could be maintained by the performance of annual assessment work of the value of $100; and we think it is no less clear that, after failure to do assessment work, the owner equally maintains his claim, within the meaning \n\n[280 U.S. 306, 318]\n\u00a0\n of the Leasing Act, by a resumption of work, unless at least some form of challenge on behalf of the United States to the valid existence of the claim has intervened; for as this court said in Belk v. Meagher, supra, at page 283 of 104 U. S.: 'His rights after resumption were precisely what they would have been if no default (that is, no default in the doing of assessment labor) and occurred.' Resumption of work by the owner, unlike a relocation by him, is an act not in derogation, but in affirmance, of the original location; and thereby the claim is 'maintained' no less than it is by performance of the annual assessment labor. Such resumption does not restore a lost estate (see Knutson v. Fredlund, 56 Wash. 634, 639, 106 P. 200); it preserves an existing estate. We are of opinion that the Secretary's decision to the contrary violates the plain words of the excepting clause of the Leasing Act.\n\n 2. \nWhile the decisions of this Court exhibit a reluctance to direct a writ of mandamus against an executive officer, they recognize the duty to do so by settled principles of law in some cases. Lane v. Hoglund, \n244 \nU.S. 174, 181\n, 37 S. Ct. 558, 560, and cases cited. In Roberts, Treasurer, v. United States, \n176 \nU.S. 221, 231\n, 20 S. Ct. 376, 379, referred to and quoted in the Hoglund Case, this Court said:\n'Every statute to some extent requires construction by the public officer whose duties may be defined therein. Such officer must read of law, and he must therefore, in a certain sense, construe it, in order to form a judgment from its language what duty he is directed by the statute to perform. But that does not necessarily and in all cases make the duty of the officer anything other than a purely ministerial one. If the law direct him to perform an act in regard to which no discretion is committed to him, and which, upon the facts existing, he is bound to perform, then that act is ministerial, although depending upon a statute which requires, in some degree, \n\n[280 U.S. 306, 319]\n\u00a0\n a construction of its language by the officer. Unless this be so, the value of this writ is very greatly impaired. Every executive officer whose duty is plainly devolved upon him by statute might refuse to perform it, and when his refusal is brought before the court he might successfully plead that the performance of the duty involved the construction of a statute by him, and therefore it was not ministerial, and the court would on that account be powerless to give relief. Such a limitation of the powers of the court, we think, would be most unfortunate, as it would relieve from judicial supervision all executive officers in the performance of their duties, whenever they should plead that the duty required of them arose upon the construction of a statute, no matter how plain its language, nor how plainly they violated their duty in refusing to perform the act required.'\n\n See, also, Ballinger v. United States ex rel. Frost, \n216 \nU.S. 240, 250\n, 30 S. Ct. 338.\n In this case, the Secretary interpreted and applied a statute in a way contrary to its explicit terms, and in so doing departed from a plain official duty. A writ of mandamus should issue directing a disposal of the application for patent on its merits, unaffected by the temporary default in the performance of assessment labor for the assessment year 1920; and that further proceedings be in conformity with the views expressed in this opinion as to the proper interpretation and application of the excepting clause of the Leasing Act of February 25, 1920 (30 USCA  193) and of section 2324, Revised Statutes of the United States (30 USCA  28). A writ in that form follows the precedent established by this Court in respect of the writ of injunction in Payne v. Central Pac. Ry. Co., \n255 \nU.S. 228, 238\n, 41 S. Ct. 314, and Payne v. New Mexico, \n255 \nU.S. 367, 373\n, 41 S. Ct. 333, as being better suited to the occasion than that indicated by the District Court of Appeals. As so modified, the judgment of that court is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","147":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILBUR v. UNITED STATES(1930)\nNo. 77\nArgued: Decided: April 14, 1930\n\n\n\n\n[281 U.S. 206, 207]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General, and Mr. Richardson, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Webster Ballinger, of Washington, D. C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a petition for a writ of mandamus commanding the Secretary of the Interior to restore the relators to \n\n[281 U.S. 206, 208]\n\u00a0\n the supplemental rolls of the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota and to apy to each of them a per capita share of all future distributions, whether of interest or principal, made from the fund created under section 7 of the act of January 14, 1889, c. 24, 25 Stat. 642.\n The writ was denied by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, but that ruling was reversed by the Court of Appeals, 58 App. D. C. 365, 30 F.(2d) 989, and the matter is here for review on certiorari.\n When the act of 1889 was passed, the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota comprised eleven bands or tribes occupying ten distinct reservations in that state in virtue of treaties or executive orders. Collectively they were regarded as a single tribe, and commonly called Chippewas of Minnesota. \n1\n They numbered about 8,300, and their reservations contained approximately 4,700,000 acres. They were tribal Indians, under the guardianship of the United States, and held their reservations as tribal lands. The act of 1889 was directed to accomplishing their transition from the existing tribal relation and dependent wardship to full individual emancipation with its incident rights and responsibilities; and to that end \n\n[281 U.S. 206, 209]\n\u00a0\n the act made provision for obtaining, through a commission, a cession of all of their tribal lands, save portions of the White Earth and Red Lake Reservations needed for allotments; for using the unceded lands in making allotments in severalty, which were to be held subject to prescribed restrictions against alienation, incumbrance, and taxation during a period of twenty-five years, or longer, if the President so directed; and for selling the ceded lands and creating with the net proceeds an interest- bearing fund, which was to be held in the United States Treasury and expended for the benefit of the Indians, as will appear later on.\n The act required that the cession have the assent of two-thirds of the male adults and have the approval of the President; directed that the commission obtaining the cession make a census roll of each band or tribe as a guide in ascertaining whether the requisite number of Indians assented to the cession and in making contemplated allotments and payments; required, with exceptions not here material, that the Indians other than those on the Red Lake Reservation be removed to the White Earth Reservation, there to receive allotments; and directed that, after the completion of necessary preliminaries, allotments be made to all of the Indians as soon as practicable.\n The contemplated cession was obtained from the Indians and was approved by the President, March 4, 1890. The intended census rolls were made and transmitted to the Secretary of the Interior. Several provisions of the act have now been fully executed, and others are still in process of administration. The fund created from the proceeds of the sale of the ceded lands is a large one; and the relators here are asserting a right to share in all future distributions therefrom.\n The provisions governing the creation and use of that fund are embodied in section 7 of the act, and are here \n\n[281 U.S. 206, 210]\n\u00a0\n quoted at length-those which the parties emphasize being put in italics:\n'Sec. 7. That all money accruing from the disposal of said lands in conformity with the provisions of this act shall, after deducting all the expenses of making the census, of obtaining the cession and relinquishment, of making the removal and allotments, and of completing the surveys and appraisals, in this act provided, be placed in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of all the Chippewa Indians in the State of Minnesota as a permanent fund, which shall draw interest at the rate of five per centum per annum, payable annually for the period of fifty years, after the allotments provided for in this act have been made, and which interest and permanent funds shall be expended for the benefit of said Indians in manner following: One-half of said interest shall, during the said period of fifty years, except in the cases hereinafter otherwise provided, be annually paid in cash in equal shares to the heads of families and guardians of orphan minors for their use; and one-fourth of said interest shall, during the same period and with the like exception, be annually paid in cash in equal shares per capita to all other classes of said Indians; and the remaining one-fourth of said interest shall, during the said period of fifty years, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, be devoted exclusively to the establishment and maintenance of a system of free schools among said Indians, in their midst and for their benefit; and at the expiration of the said fity years, the said permanent fund shall be divided and paid to all of said Chippewa Indians and their issue then living, in cash, in equal shares: Provided, That Congress may, in its discretion, from time to time, during the said period of fifty years, appropriate, for the purpose of promoting civilization and self- support among the said Indians, a portion of said principal sum, not exceeding five per centum thereof. \n\n[281 U.S. 206, 211]\n\u00a0\n The United States shall, for the benefit of said Indians, advance to them as such interest as aforesaid the sum of ninety thousand dollars annually, counting from the time when the removal and allotments provided for in this act shall have been made, unitl such time as said permanent fund, exclusive of the deductions hereinbefore provided for, shall equal or exceed the sum of three million dollars, less any actual interest that may in the meantime accrue from accumulations of said permanent fund; the payments of such interest to be made yearly in advance, and, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, may, as to three-fourths thereof, during the first five years be expended in procuring livestock, teams, farming implements, and seed for such of the Indians to the extent of their shares as are fit and desire to engage in farming, but as to the rest, in cash; and whenever said permanent fund shall exceed the sum of three million dollars the United States shall be fully reimbursed out of such excess, for all the advances of interest made as herein contemplated and other expenses hereunder.'\n\n In the negotiations resulting in the cession the commission construed the clauses providing for annual payments of one-half of the interest 'in equal shares to the heads of families and guardians of orphan minors' and of one-fourth of the Interest 'in equal shares per capita to all other classes of said Indians' as meaning that three-fourths of the interest should be paid annually to the Indians in equal shares per capita; and the Secretary of the Interior, in laying the cession before the President for his approval, pronounced that construction reasonable, and declared it should be adhered to. H. R. Ex. Doc. No. 247, 51st Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 5, 6, 24. For several years payments under those clauses were made on that basis. Then the Secretary of the Treasury submitted to the Comptroller the question whether that basis of payment properly could be continued; and the \n\n[281 U.S. 206, 212]\n\u00a0\n Comptroller, after observing that the clauses were obscurely worded, ruled that the construction given to them by the commission had become the true construction through its adoption in actual practice, and should be respected accordingly. 3 Comp. Dec. 158. All subsequent payments have been made, as the prior ones were, in accordance with that construction.\n Manifestly some preliminary steps would need to be taken before the interest annuities could be rightly paid. The number of Indians entitled to participate would need to be ascertained so that the per capita share to be paid to each could be calculated; and those so entitled would need to be listed so that the paying tellers would know whom to pay. From the beginning these practical needs have been met by taking the commission's census rolls as a primary guide, climinating the names of Indians dying after those rolls were made, making supplemental rolls of Indians erroneously omitted from the census rolls and of Indian children entitled to participate but born after the census was taken, and using the two sets of rolls-appropriately brought up to date and made to include only persons in being at the time-as a correct basis for the necessary calculation and listing.\n This general statement will open the way for a better appreciation of the special facts and contentions in the present case.\n Mary Blair, a full-blood Chippewa woman, was a member of the White Earth band in Minnesota, and as such was included in the census rolls and given an allotment on the White Earth Reservation. Sarah Cogger, a daughter of Mary Blair, is of mixed Chippewa and white blood. She was born in 1892, after the census rolls were made, was enrolled on the supplemental rolls soon after her birth, and was recognized as a member of the White Earth band up to the time of her marriage. In 1909 she was married to Mall Kadrie, a Syrian by birth but a \n\n[281 U.S. 206, 213]\n\u00a0\n naturalized citizen of the United States. After her marriage she abandoned her tribal relations, and ever since has resided with her huband among white people-for several years in Canada and Syria, and during the later years at International Falls and St. Paul in Minnesota. She was paid a per capita share in all interest annuities distributed after her enrollment and before her abandonment of the tribal relations, and has received a like share in all subsequent annuities-these later payments to her being in accord with the statutes which save to such an Indian her personal right to share in annuities, tribal funds, etc., as though her tribal relations were maintained. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The nine relators are minor children of Sarah and Mall Kadrie, and were born-the first four in Canada and the others at International Falls and St. Paul in Minnesota-after their mother had abandoned her tribal relations and was permanently residing with her husband among white people. So, while all of the relators have a minor fraction of Minnesota Chippewa blood, they were born of parents having no tribal relations then or since, and have lived only in white communities.\n At their mother's request, following their respective births, the first three of these children were placed on the supplemental rolls and shared in some of the interest annuities. A like request on behalf of the fourth child led to an inquiry which brought attention to the mother's marriage to a white man, her abandonment of the tribal relations, and the birth of the four children in Canada where the parents were then residing. With these facts before it, the Indian Bureau, in 1916, declined to enroll the fourth child, and canceled the prior enrollment of the first three. Paragraph 4 of section 324 of the Regulations of the Indian Bureau, as amended April 1, 1905, was \n\n[281 U.S. 206, 214]\n\u00a0\n cited as the applicable administrative rule in such matters. That paragraph reads:\n'All children born to annuitants either before or since the last preceding payment, who have not already been enrolled, should be enrolled with their parents. This includes cases where the mother is an Indian woman married to a white man, and such woman and her issue are recognized by the tribe as belonging thereto, and where the family so founded identifies itself and affiliates with the tribe of which the mother is a recognized member. When an Indian woman by her marriage with a white man has, in effect, withdrawn from the tribe and is no longer identified with the tribal community and interests, the offspring of such a marriage are not entitled to share in annuities or other benefits as Indians and must not be enrolled.'\n\n In 1919 the Secretary of the Unterior, following an opinion given by the solicitor for that Department, ruled that Mrs. Kadrie's children were entitled to share in the interest annuities. The children born up to that time were then placed on the supplemental rolls, and those born thereafter were enrolled soon after birth. All then shared for a time in the annuities. In 1927 a succeeding Secretary of the Interior, adopting and applying an opinion given by a succeeding solicitor, held that these children were not entitled to share in the interest annuities, and accordingly directed that their enrollment be canceled and no further payment be made to them.\n The two solicitors differed sharply. The first was of opinion that the act of 1889 should be construed and given effect as if it were a conventional deed of trust; and with this as a premise he concluded that the fund established under section 7 is not a tribal fund, but one held for designated Indian beneficiaries as individuals, and that the beneficiaries comprise, first, all Indians now living who were included in the census rolls as members \n\n[281 U.S. 206, 215]\n\u00a0\n of the tribe, and secondly, all living lineal descendants of any Indian so enrolled, regardless of whether the descendant is or ever was a member, and even though he was born of parents neither of whom was a member at the time. And, as the Kadrie children are lineal descendants (grandchildren) of Mary Blair, who was included in the census rolls as a member, that solicitor regarded them as entitled to share in the distributions. \n3\n The second solicitor was of opinion that the act is to be construed and given effect as an exertion by Congress of its authority over the affairs and property of tribal Indians under the guardianship of the United States; that the fund established under section 7 is a tribal fund derived from the sale of tribal lands, and is held and being administered as such by the United States; that the tribe has not been dissolved, but is recognized by Congress as still existing; that in this situation the right to share in the interest annuities depends upon existing tribal membership, save in exceptional instances where Congress has provided otherwise; and that the Kadrie children, all ow whom were born of a white father and after their mother had separated from the tribe and was permanently living among white people, are without tribal \n\n[281 U.S. 206, 216]\n\u00a0\n membership and not within any exceptional provision permitting other than existing members to share in such annunities. This solicitor rested his opinion in part upon the general rule that, in the absence of provision to the contrary, the right of individual Indians to share in tribal property, whether lands or funds, depends upon tribal membership, is terminated when the membership is ended, and is neither alienable nor descendible. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n'Sarah Kadrie and her children are 'issue' of her mother, a full- blood Chippewa Indian duly enrolled, and as such they will be entitled, at the expiration of the trust period, to share in the distribution of the trust fund; and meanwhile they are equally entitled to share in the annuities arising from that fund. Those rights they have not forfeited either by acquiring foreign citizenship or by abandoning, or failing to acquire, residence on the Indian reservation or with the tribe.'\n\n In the present petition the relators assert that the decision of the Secretary of the Interior in 1927, although given after notice and hearing, is void in that the then Secretary was without power to reconsider and revoke the decision of his predecessor in 1919 on the same matter; and they further assert that the decision in 1927 is otherwise wrong, in that it rests upon untenable rulings to the effect that the fund established under section 7 is a tribal fund and is held and being administered as such by the United States, that the tribe has not been dissolved, and that the right to share in the annuities from the fund is confined to members of the tribe save in exceptional instances which do not include the relators. Upon these grounds the relators seek a writ of mandamus directing in substance, that the Secretary of the Interior put aside the decision of 1927 and restore and give effect to that of 1919\n\n\n If at the time of the decision in 1927 the Secretary of the Interior was without power to reconsider and revoke the decision of 1919, it well may be that the relators would be entitled to the relief by mandamus which they seek. 5 But there was no such want of power. The de- \n\n[281 U.S. 206, 217]\n\u00a0\n cision in 1919, was, not a judgment pronounced in a judicial proceeding, but a ruling made by an executive officer in the exertion of administrative authority. That authority was neither exhausted nor terminated by its exertion on that occasion, but was in its nature continuing. Under it the Secretary who made the decision could reconsider the matter and revoke the decision if found wrong; and so of his successor. The latter was charged, no less than the former had been, with the duty of supervising the payment of the interest annuities and of causing them to be distributed among those entitled to them and no others; and, if he found that individuals not so entitled were sharing in the annuities by reason of a mistaken or erroneous ruling of the former, his authority to revoke that ruling and stop further payments under it was the same as if it had been his own act. 6 The power and duties of such an office are impersonal and unaffected by a change in the person holding it.\n The case of United States v. Atkins, \n260 \nU.S. 220\n, 43 S. Ct. 78, relied on by the relators, is not in point. It involved an enrollment by a special commission under a statute providing that the enrollment when approved by the Secretary of the Interior should be 'final' and entitle the person enrolled to an allotment. The Secretary approved and in usual course an allotment was made and a patent issued. Thereafter the enrollment was drawn in question in a suit brought to cancel the patent. This Court hled that the statute was intended to make the enrollment when approved by the Secretary conclusive of the individual's existence, membership, etc., and unimpeach able \n\n[281 U.S. 206, 218]\n\u00a0\n except for such fraud or mistake as would afford ground for avoiding a judgment in adversary proceedings. There is no like provision in the act of 1889. Nor does it contain any mention of supplemental rolls. They are administrative devices intended to safeguard and facilitate the distribution of the annuities. No doubt they are intended to be evidential of the right to share therein, but there is no basis for holding them conclusive or not subject to revision.\n As the decision of the Secretary in 1927 was made in the exercise of lawful authority, it becomes necessary to examine the complaint that the decision on the merits is wrong. In doing so there is need for having in mind the limited scope of the remedy here invoked.\n Mandamus is employed to compel the performance, when refused, of a ministerial duty, this being its chief use. It also is employed to compel action, when refused, in matters involving judgment and discretion, but not to direct the exercise of judgment or discretion in a particular way nor to direct the retraction or reversal of action already taken in the exercise of either. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The duties of executive officers, such as the Secretary of the Interior, usually are connected with the administration of statutes which must be read and in a sense construed to ascertain what is required. But it does not follow that these administrative duties all involve judgment or discretion of the character intended by the rule just stated. Where the duty in a particular situation is so plaintly prescribed as to be free from doubt and equivalent to a positive command, it is regarded as being so \n\n[281 U.S. 206, 219]\n\u00a0\n far ministerial that its performance may be compelled by mandamus, unless there be provision or implication to the contrary. \n8\n But where the duty is not thus plainly prescribed, but depends upon a statute or statutes the construction or application of which is not free from doubt, it is regarded as involving the character of judgment or discretion which cannot be controlled by mandamus. \n 9\n\u00a0\n\n A reference to three of the cases just cited will serve to illustrate the application of this doctrine in instances where mandamus is sought for the purpose of controlling a secretary in the discharge of duties of the latter class. In Riverside Oil Co. v. Hitchcock mandamus was sought as a means of compelling the Secretary of the Interior to retract a decision theretofore given and to make another along different lines. This Court, after pointing out that the Secretary's duty in the matter was not formal or ministerial, said: 'The court has no general supervisory power over the officers of the Land Department, by which to control their decisions upon questions within their jurisdiction. If this writ were granted we would require the Secretary of the Interior to repudiate and disaffirm a decision which he regarded it his duty to make in the exercise of that judgment which is reposed in him by law, and we should require him to come to a determination upon the issues involved directly opposite to that which he had reached, and which the law conferred \n\n[281 U.S. 206, 220]\n\u00a0\n upon him the jurisdiction to make. Mandamus has never been regarded as the proper writ to control the judgment and discretion of an officer as to the decision of a matter which the law gave him the power and imposed upon him the duty to decide for himself. The writ never can be used as a substitute for a writ of error. Nor does the fact that no writ of error will lie in such a case as this, by which to review the judgment of the Secretary, furnish any foundation for the claim that mandamus may therefore he awarded.' In Knight v. Lane, where a proposed adjustment of a controversy between Indians over an allotment had been approved by the Secretary in one decision and afterwards disapproved in another, it was said: 'Inasmuch as the decision of the Secretary, revoking his prior approval of the proposed adjustment, was not arbitrary or capricious, but was given after a hearing, and in the exercise of a judgment and discretion confided to him by law, it cannot be reviewed, or he be compelled to retract it, by mandamus.' And in Lane v. Mickadiet mandamus was sought as a means of preventing the Secretary from reconsidering, after notice and hearing, a prior decision determining who were the heirs of a deceased Indian and sustaining the Indian's adoption of a child not related to him. The mandamus was refused on the ground that the Secretary's judgment and discretion in determining such heirships could not be thus controlled; and, in disposing of an argument similar to one which is advanced here, the court said: 'But it is said that the purpose of the statute was to give the recognized heir a status which would entitle him to enjoy the allotted land, and not to leave all his rights of enjoyment open to changing decisions which might be made during the long period of the trust term, and thus virtually destroy the right of property in favor of the heir which it was the obvious purpose of the statute to protect. But, \n\n[281 U.S. 206, 221]\n\u00a0\n in last analysis, this is a mere argument seeking to destroy a lawful power by the suggestion of a possible abuse.'\n It is apparent that, with the question of the Secretary's authority resolved against the relators, the only question open in this proceeding is whether the decision of 1927 was given is the discharge of a ministerial duty controllable by mandamus or of a duty requiring the exercise of judgment or discretion not thus controllable.\n The questions mooted before the Secretary and decided by him were whether the fund is a tribal fund, whether the tribe is still existing, and whether the distribution of the annuitied is to be confined to members of the tribe, with exceptions not including the relators. These are all questions of law, the solution of which requires a construction of the act of 1889 and other related acts. A reading of these acts shows that they fall short of plainly requiring that any of the questions be answered in the negative and that in some aspects they give color to the affirmative answers of the Secretary. That the construction of the acts in so far as they have a bearing on the first and third questions is sufficiently uncertain to involve the exercise of judgment and discretion is rather plain. The second question is more easily answered, for not only does the act of 1889 show very plainly that the purpose was to accomplish a gradual rather than an immediate transition from the tribal relation and dependent wardship to full emancipation and individual responsibility, but Congress in many later acts-some near the time of the decision in question-has recognized the continued existence of the tribe. 10 This recognition was respected by the Secretary, \n\n[281 U.S. 206, 222]\n\u00a0\n and is not open to question here. \n11\n With the tribe still existing, the criticism by counsel for the relators of the Secretary's decision in other particulars loses much of its force.\n The time fixed for the final distribution is as yet so remote that no one is now in a position to ask special relief or direction respecting that distribution.\n From what has been said it follows that the case is not one in which mandamus will lie.\n Judgment of Court of Appeals reversed.\n Judgment of Supreme Court affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These Indians formerly were part of the Chippewa or Ojibway Nation of the Great Lakes region. The Nation comprised many subordinate bands or tribes, some of which came to be permanently located in Canada and others in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and perhaps other states. The bands or tribes which came to be seated in Minnesota have latterly been designated as the Chippewas of Minnesota by way of distinguishing them from those seated elsewhere.

Lane for the State of Illinois et al. \n\n[388 \nU.S. 426, 427]\n\u00a0\n\n\nDECREE.\n\n  This Court having reopened Original cases Nos. 1, 2, and 3, and having granted leave to file Original case No. 11, and having referred all such cases to a Special Master who has filed his Report, and the parties having agreed to the form of the decree, the Findings of Fact in the Report are hereby adopted, and it being unnecessary at this time to consider the Special Master's legal conclusions,\n\nIT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that:\n\n1. The State of Illinois and its municipalities, political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities, including, among others, the cities of Chicago, Evanston, Highland Park, Highwood and Lake Forest, the villages of Wilmette, Kenilworth, Winnetka, and Glencoe, the Elmhurst-Villa Park-Lombard Water Commission, the Chicago Park District and the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago, their employees and agents and all persons assuming to act under their authority, are hereby enjoined from diverting any of the waters of Lake Michigan or its watershed into the Illinois waterway, whether by way of domestic pumpage from the lake the sewage effluent derived from which reaches the Illinois waterway, or by way of storm runoff from the Lake Michigan watershed which is diverted into the Sanitary and Ship Canal, or by way of direct diversion from the lake into the canal, in excess of an average for all of them combined of 3,200 cubic feet per second. \"Domestic pumpage,\" as used in this decree, includes water supplied to commercial and industrial establishments and \"domestic use\" includes use by such establishments. The water permitted by this decree to be diverted from Lake Michigan and its watershed may be apportioned by the State of Illinois among its municipalities, political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities \n\n[388 \nU.S. 426, 428]\n\u00a0\n for domestic use or for direct diversion into the Sanitary and Ship Canal to maintain it in a reasonably satisfactory sanitary condition, in such manner and amounts and by and through such instrumentalities as the State may deem proper, subject to any regulations imposed by Congress in the interests of navigation or pollution control.\n\n2. The amount of water diverted into the Sanitary and Ship Canal directly from Lake Michigan and as storm runoff from the Lake Michigan watershed shall be determined by deducting from the total flow in the canal at Lockport (a) the total amount of domestic pumpage from Lake Michigan and from ground sources in the Lake Michigan watershed, except to the extent that any such ground sources are supplied by infiltration from Lake Michigan, by the State of Illinois and its municipalities, political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities the sewage effluent derived from which reaches the canal, (b) the total amount of domestic pumpage from ground and surface sources outside the Lake Michigan watershed the sewage effluent derived from which reaches the canal, (c) the total estimated storm runoff from the upper Illinois River watershed reaching the canal, (d) the total amount of domestic pumpage from all sources by municipalities and political subdivisions of the States of Indiana and Wisconsin the sewage effluent derived from which reaches the canal, and (e) any water diverted by Illinois, with the consent of the United States, into Lake Michigan from any source outside the Lake Michigan watershed.\n\n3. For the purpose of determining whether the total amount of water diverted from Lake Michigan by the State of Illinois and its municipalities, political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities is not in excess of the maximum amount permitted by this decree, the amounts of domestic pumpage from the lake by the \n\n[388 \nU.S. 426, 429]\n\u00a0\n State and its municipalities, political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities the sewage and sewage effluent derived from which reaches the Illinois waterway, either above or below Lockport, shall be added to the amount of direct diversion into the canal from the lake and storm runoff reaching the canal from the Lake Michigan watershed computed as provided in paragraph 2 of this decree. The accounting period shall consist of the period of 12 months terminating on the last day of February. A period of five years, consisting of the current annual accounting period and the previous four such periods (all after the effective date of this decree), shall be permitted, when necessary, for achieving an average diversion which is not in excess of the maximum permitted amount; provided, however, that the average diversion in any annual accounting period shall not exceed one hundred ten (110) per cent of the maximum amount permitted by this decree. The measurements and computations required by this decree shall be made by the appropriate officers, agencies, or instrumentalities of the State of Illinois under the general supervision and direction of the Corps of Engineers of the United States Army.\n\n4. The State of Illinois may make application for a modification of this decree so as to permit the diversion of additional water from Lake Michigan for domestic use when and if it appears that the reasonable needs of the Northeastern Illinois Metropolitan Region (comprising Cook, Du Page, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will Counties) for water for such use cannot be met from the water resources available to the region, including both ground and surface water and the water permitted by this decree to be diverted from Lake Michigan, and if it further appears that all feasible means reasonably available to the State of Illinois and its municipalities, political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities \n\n[388 \nU.S. 426, 430]\n\u00a0\n have been employed to improve the water quality of the Sanitary and Ship Canal and to conserve and manage the water resources of the region and the use of water therein in accordance with the best modern scientific knowledge and engineering practice.\n\n5. This decree shall become effective on March 1, 1970, and shall thereupon supersede the decree entered by this Court in Nos. 1, 2, and 3, Original Docket, on April 21, 1930, as enlarged May 22, 1933, provided that for the period between January 1, 1970, and March 1, 1970, the amount of water diverted by Illinois into the Sanitary and Ship Canal (determined in accordance with paragraph 2 of this decree) shall not exceed an average of 1,500 cubic feet per second.\n\n6. The complaint of the State of Illinois in No. 11, Original Docket, on behalf of its instrumentality, the Elmhurst-Villa Park-Lombard Water Commission, is hereby dismissed, without prejudice to that Commission sharing in the water permitted by this decree to be diverted from Lake Michigan.\n\n7. Any of the parties hereto may apply at the foot of this decree for any other or further action or relief, and this Court retains jurisdiction of the suits in Nos. 1, 2, and 3, Original Docket, for the purpose of making any order or direction, or modification of this decree, or any supplemental decree, which it may deem at any time to be proper in relation to the subject matter in controversy.\n\n8. All the parties to these proceedings shall bear their own costs. The costs and expenses of the Special Master shall be equally divided between the plaintiffs as a group and the defendants as a group in Nos. 1, 2, and 3, Original Docket. The costs and expenses thus imposed upon the plaintiffs and defendants shall be borne by the individual plaintiffs and defendants, respectively, in equal shares. \n\n[388 \nU.S. 426, 431]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","149":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWISCONSIN v. ILLINOIS(1930)\nNo. 1 ORIG\nArgued: Decided: April 21, 1930\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Together with No. 2, Orig., Michigan v. Illinois et al., and No. 3, Orig., New York v. Illinois et al.\n\n Decree amended.\n\n Decree reported: \n281 \nU.S. 696\n; decree enlarged: \n289 \nU.S. 395\n; decree entered: \n388 \nU.S. 426\n.\n\n ORDERED:\n\nA. Paragraph 3 of the Decree entered by the Court herein on June 12, 1967, is amended to read as follows:\n\n3. For the purpose of determining whether the total amount of water diverted from Lake Michigan by the State of Illinois and its municipalities, political sub-divisions, agencies and instrumentalities is not in excess of the maximum amount permitted by this decree, the amounts of domestic pumpage from the lake by the State and its municipalities, political sub-divisions, agencies and instrumentalities the sewage and sewage effluent derived from which reaches the Illinois waterway, either above or below Lockport, shall be added to the amount of direct diversion into the canal from the lake and storm runoff reaching the canal from the Lake Michigan watershed computed as provided in Paragraph 2 of this decree. The annual accounting period shall consist of twelve months terminating on the last day of September. A period of forty (40) years, consisting of the current annual accounting period and the previous thirty-nine (39) such periods (all after the effective date of this decree), shall be permitted, when necessary, for achieving an average diversion which is not in excess of the maximum permitted amount; provided, however, that the average diversion in any annual accounting \n\n[449 \nU.S. 48, 49]\n\u00a0\n period shall not exceed 3680 cubic feet per second, except that in any two (2) annual accounting periods within a forty (40) year period, the average annual diversion may not exceed 3840 cubic feet per second as a result of extreme hydrologic conditions; and, that for the first thirty-nine (39) years the cumulative algebraic sum of each annual accounting period's average diversion minus 3200 cubic feet per second shall not exceed 2000 cubic feet per second-years. All measurements and computations required by this decree shall be made by the appropriate officers, agencies or instrumentalities of the State of Illinois, or the Corps of Engineers of the United States Army subject to agreement with and cost-sharing by the State of Illinois for all reasonable costs including equipment, using the best current engineering practice and scientific knowledge. If made by the State of Illinois, the measurements and computations shall be conducted under the continuous supervision and direction of the Corps of Engineers of the United States Army in cooperation and consultation with the United States Geological Survey, including but not limited to periodic field investigation of measuring device calibration and data gathering. All measurements and computations made by the State of Illinois shall be subject to periodic audit by the Corps of Engineers. An annual report on the measurements and computations required by this decree shall be issued by the Corps of Engineers. Best current engineering practice and scientific knowledge shall be determined within six (6) months after implementation of the decree based upon a recommendation from a majority of the members of a three-member committee. The members of this committee shall be appointed by the Chief of Engineers of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The members shall be selected on the basis of recognized experience and technical expertise in flow measurement or hydrology. None of the committee members shall be employees of the Corps of Engineers or employees or paid consultants of any of the parties to these proceedings other than \n\n[449 \nU.S. 48, 50]\n\u00a0\n the United States. The Corps of Engineers shall convene such a committee upon implementation of this decree and at least each five (5) years after implementation of this decree to review and report to the Corps of Engineers and the parties on the method of accounting and the operation of the accounting procedure. Reasonable notice of these meetings must be given to each of the parties. Each party to these proceedings shall have the right to attend committee meetings, inspect any and all measurement facilities and structures, have access to any data and reports and be permitted to take its own measurements.\n\nB. Paragraph 5 of the said Decree entered by the Court herein is amended by adding thereto an additional sentence to read as follows:\n\nThe amendment to Paragraph 3 of this decree shall take effect on the first day of October following the passage into law by the General Assembly of the State of Illinois of an amendment to the Level of Lake Michigan Act providing that the amount used for dilution in the Sanitary and Ship Canal for water quality purposes shall not be increased above three hundred twenty (320) cubic feet per second, and that in allocations to new users of Lake Michigan water, allocations for domestic purposes be given priority and to the extent practicable allocations to new users of Lake Michigan water shall be made with the goal of reducing withdrawals from the Cambrian-Ordovician aquifer.\n\nC. A certified copy of the above legislation shall be served upon the parties and filed with the Clerk of the Supreme Court by the State of Illinois. If no party raises an objection to the adequacy of the legislation within 30 days of service, Illinois will have complied with the requirements of the amendment made by this Order to paragraph 5 of the Decree entered by the Court herein on June 12, 1967. Any such objection shall be raised in the manner set forth in Paragraph 7 of said Decree. \n\n[449 \nU.S. 48, 51]\n\u00a0\n\n\n IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT:\n\nEach of the parties to this proceeding shall bear its own costs. The expenses of the Special Master shall be borne by the State of Illinois and the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago, three-fifths thereof by the State of Illinois and two-fifths thereof by the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago.\n\nJUSTICE MARSHALL took no part in the consideration or decision of this order.\n\n STATEMENT OF INTENT AND TECHNICAL BASIS  FOR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO 1967 DECREE\n\n\n This statement sets forth the intent of the parties and the technical basis for the revisions to certain of the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 5 of the 1967 Decree.\n\nThe proposed change in the 1967 Decree has been designed to alter in part the provisions of the existing Decree that prevent Illinois from effectively utilizing and managing the 3200 cubic feet per second (cfs) of Lake Michigan water which Illinois was allocated.\n\nUnder the existing system, increasing amounts of impervious areas and increasing demand by domestic users elevate the risk that the language of the decree will be violated in any one or five year period if additional allocations are made by the State to domestic users for a period of years consistent with good management practice.\n\nThe proposed change accomplishes the following:\n\n1. Increases the period for determining compliance with the 3200 cfs limit from a five year running average to a forty year running average;\n\n\n2. During the first thirty-nine years of the decree, allows Illinois to exceed the 3200 cfs limit by 2000 cfs-years in the aggregate (one cfs-year is the volume of water resulting from an average flow of one cfs for a period of one year); \n\n[449 \nU.S. 48, 52]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n3. Limits the average diversion in any one accounting period to 115% of 3200 cfs, but in two years of any forty year period permits the average diversion to reach 120% of 3200 cfs, to allow for extreme hydrologic conditions.\n\n\n The lengthening of the averaging period from five to forty years reduces the variability of the averaged figure, thus decreasing the amount of water that needs to be held in reserve for storm water runoff and increasing the amount of water that may be allocated for domestic purposes to reduce in part the pumpage from the Cambrian-Ordovician aquifer.\n\nThe lengthening of the averaging period also allows an increase in the planning period to a period of time that is more compatible with the life of certain types of water supply facilities, thus permitting more efficient use of the available diversion without increasing the total allowable diversion, and permitting better management of all the water resources of the region.\n\nIn establishing the limits of paragraph three of the amended decree, the available data and uncertainties as to the behavior of and interactions between the various elements of the hydrologic regime under current and future conditions were limiting factors.\n\nTo estimate maximum hydrologic variations that must be considered in the allocation accounting process, the forty-four year precipitation and runoff data contained in \"Water Yield, Urbanization, and the North Branch of the Chicago River,\" a report by the Northeastern Illinois Planning Commission and Hydrocomp, Inc., dated October 14, 1976, were used. These data assumed a 30% imperviousness factor and were used by the parties to approximate the conditions of the entire Lake Michigan diversion watershed at the present time.\n\nThese data indicate that the maximum departure above the mean annual stormwater flow is 59%. Assuming, therefore, \n\n[449 \nU.S. 48, 53]\n\u00a0\n that the mean annual stormwater flow is 683 cfs, the maximum departure is 405 cfs. This could result in a diversion of 13% above the allowable 3200 cfs maximum. Given the relatively short period of record and the likelihood of increased runoff resulting from urbanization, it was agreed that a 15% exceedance, to a maximum of 3680 cfs, would be allowed in any year to accommodate high stormflows and that in any two years of the 40 year accounting period the diversion may be increased by 20%, to a maximum of 3840 cfs, to accommodate extraordinary hydrologic conditions.\n\nBecause of year-to-year variations in storm runoff there will be series of years when the average annual diversion will need to exceed 3200 cfs for best management, and some years when the diversion will be less than the 3200 cfs average. Calculations of the cumulative sum of the annual departures show that the maximum cumulative exceedance of 3200 cfs would be slightly below 1500 cfs-years as indicated by the forty-four years of data that were used. The possibility exists that in the initial forty year period the cumulative exceedance may be greater than 1500 cfs-years. Since the record used is relatively short and urbanization is likely to increase runoff, the maximum cumulative exceedance has been established at 2000 cfs-years.\n\nThe goal of this amended Decree is to maintain the longterm average annual diversion of water from Lake Michigan at or below 3200 cfs. \n\n[449 \nU.S. 48, 54]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
