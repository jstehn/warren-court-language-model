States Supreme Court\nADKINS v. ARNOLD(1914)\nNo. 52\nArgued: Decided: December 14, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 417, 418]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Lewis C. Lawson for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 417, 419]\n\u00a0\n No appearance for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit to foreclose a mortgage upon real property, 80 acres of which were part of a Creek allotment. The allotment was made on behalf of Otheola Adkins, after her death, which occurred in her infancy. Her mother was a Creek woman, duly enrolled as such, but her father was not a Creek citizen. The date of the allotment is not given, but it is conceded that the allotment passed a life estate or more to the mother and nothing to the father. After the allotment was completed and the usual tribal deed issued, the father and mother joined in executing and delivering a deed for the 80 acres to one Arnold, who in turn mortgaged it to the plaintiff. The mother was made a defendant to the suit, and by her answer set up two defenses requiring notice here. One was to the effect that the deed to Arnold was made in violation of restrictions imposed by Congress upon the right to alienate the land, and therefore was void; and the other was to the effect that the deed did not satisfy the requirements of a law of Arkansas, put in force in the Indian Territory by Congress, and therefore did not affect or pass her title. Upon a demurrer to the answer, which set forth the deed and the certificate of its ac- \n\n[235 U.S. 417, 420]\n\u00a0\n knowledgment, these defenses were held not well taken and there was a judgment for the plaintiff. The judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 32 Okla. 167, 121 Pac. 186.\n Other rulings than those just mentioned were made in the cause, but they need not be noticed, for no Federal question was involved in them.\n The claim that the deed to Arnold was made in violation of existing restrictions rests upon the assumption that  16 of the act of June 30, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 500, chap. 1323), imposed restrictions upon the alienation of all Creek allotments. That this is an erroneous assumption is shown is Skelton v. Dill, \n235 U.S. 206\n, 59 L. ed. --, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 60. Only allotments to living members in their own right were subjected to restrictions. Allotments on behalf of deceased members were left unrestricted. Thus the mother was at liberty to make a sale of her interest to Arnold if she chose.\n A right appreciation of the claim respecting the insufficiency of the deed involves a consideration of the acts of Congress adopting and extending over the Indian Territory certain statutes of Arkansas. The act of May 2, 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 81, chap. 182),  31, put in force, until Congress should otherwise provide, several general laws of Arkansas appearing in Mansfield's Digest of 1884, among them being chapter 104 concerning the rights of married women. Section 4621 of this chapter reads as follows:\n'The real and personal property of any femme covert in this state, acquired either before or after marriage, whether by gift, grant, inheritance, devise, or otherwise, shall, so long as she may choose, be and remain her separate estate and property, and may be devised, bequeathed, or conveyed by her the same as if she were a femme sole; and the same shall not be subject to the debts of her husband.'\n\n The act of February 19, 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 841, chap. 707), put in force chapter 27 of the Mansfield's Digest of 1884 concern- \n\n[235 U.S. 417, 421]\n\u00a0\n ing conveyances of real estate, in so far as it was applicable and not inconsistent with any law of Congress. Section 648 of this chapter declares:\n'A married woman may convey her real estate or any part thereof by deed of conveyance, executed by herself and her husband, and acknowledged and certified in the manner hereinafter prescribed.'\n\n The deed to Arnold, if tested by  4621 and the applicable decisions of the supreme court of Arkansas, was sufficient to pass the mother's title, but, if tested by  648, it probably was insufficient, because not acknowledged and certified in the manner contemplated by that section.\n It is insisted that  648 is inconsistent with  4621 and should be treated as controlling because its adoption by Congress was the later in time. Assuming that the two sections are inconsistent, as claimed, we think  4621 is controlling. While both were embodied in the Arkansas compilation known as Mansfield's Digest of 1884,  4621 was a later enactment than  648, and superseded the latter in so far as they were in conflict. This was settled by the supreme court of the state before either section was put in force in the Indian Territory (Bryan v. Winburn, 43 Ark. 28; Stone v. Stone, 43 Ark. 160; Criscoe v. Hambrick, 47 Ark. 235, 1 S. W. 150), and we think Congress intended they should have the same force and meaning there that they had in Arkansas. See Robinson v. Belt, \n187 \nU.S. 41, 47\n, 48 S., 47 L. ed. 65, 68, 69, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 16. Although put in force in the Indian Territory by different acts, they were not adopted as if they were unrelated, but as parts of a single system of laws whose relative operation, as determined by the supreme court of Arkansas, had become an integral part of them. Pennock v. Dialogue, 2 Pet. 1, 18, 7 L. ed. 327, 333; Cathcart v. Robinson, 5 Pet. 264, 280, 8 L. ed. 120, 126. It was upon this theory that the supreme court of Oklahoma held the mother's deed sufficient.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAMERICAN IRON & STEEL MFG CO. v. SEABOARD AIR LINE RY(1914)\nNo. 233\nArgued: March 6, 1914Decided: April 6, 1914\n\n\n\n Under the provisions of  6 of the act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 828, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549), the circuit court of appeals of the fourth circuit certified to this court a question on which it desired instruction, and in that connection made the following statement of facts:\n'Upon a bill filed by a railway company alleging its insolvency and consequent inability to maintain itself as a going concern, except through the medium of a receivership, receivers were appointed. The bill alleged that a receivership would enable the property of the railway company to be preserved and maintained as a whole, \n\n[233 U.S. 261, 262]\n\u00a0\n and the sums due and to become due to the bondholders and creditors to be secured and ultimately paid in full.\n\n'The trustee in the first mortgage answered the bill, admitting its allegations, and afterwards filed a cross bill again admitting the allegations of the bill in regard to the insolvency of the company. The suit was not a creditors' suit. The trustee subsequently filed a bill in the same court to foreclose the mortgage, seeking a sale of the equity of redemption, and the two suits were consolidated. No prior encumbrancers were made parties to either suit. Prior to the receivership the claimant furnished supplies to the railway company, for which, shortly after the receivers were appointed, a lien was duly perfected under the statute of Virginia known as the labor and supply lien statute, Code of Va.  2485. The supplies were sold on a credit of 'thirty days, 1 per cent discount allowed for payment in ten days.' Claimant filed its claim before the special master in the receivership proceedings, relying upon a statutory lien under the statute above mentioned. The special master reported against the allowance of interest on the claim, to which report in that particular claimant excepted.\n\n'Subsequently, on the petition of the railway company, a decree was entered approving 'a plan of adjustment' of the finances of the company, and providing for turning back to the company its property, and for ending the receivership at a certain time. From time to time during the receivership and at the ratification of the plan of adjustment, and as a part thereof, all interest due at the time of the appointment of the receivers and accruing during the receivership on all the funded and many of the floating obligations of the railway company were paid in full. The amount so paid for interest aggregated some millions of dollars.\n\n'The decree approving the plan of adjustment provided that the company should pay in due course of business all \n\n[233 U.S. 261, 263]\n\u00a0\n its obligations, liabilities, and indebtedness, and reserved the right, in the event of default in that regard, to any claimant aggrieved by such default, to present his petition to the court to have his claim enforced 'to the same extent as though the receivership had continued.'\n\n'After the receivership had been thus terminated, claimant filed its petition in the court, praying that its exceptions to the special master's report should be sustained, and for the enforcement of its claims, including interest thereon during the period of the receivership, and seeking to enforce it not upon the doctrine of an equitable lien, but as a statutory lien. The circuit court refused to allow interest for the period of the receivership, and from that ruling an appeal was taken.\n\n Question.\n Is interest recoverable on such a claim for the period of the receivership?\n Messrs. George Wayne Anderson and Henry R. Pollard for the American Iron & Steel Manufacturing Company.\n Mr. L. L. Lewis for Seabord Air Line Railway et al.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Lamar:\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar delivered the opinion of the court:\n The statement of facts made by the circuit court of appeals of the fourth circuit shows that supplies were sold to a railway company on thirty days' credit. Before the credit period expired the road, alleged to be insolvent, was, on its own application, placed in the hands of receivers, their appointment being subsequently continued under a bill for foreclosure filed by mortgage trustees. The \n\n[233 U.S. 261, 264]\n\u00a0\n railway company succeeded in making a readjustment of its bonded indebtedness and the property was returned to the owners. The court, however, retained jurisdiction for the purpose of passing upon the claims of creditors aggrieved by the company's default in paying its obligations. Among those presented was the American Iron & Steel Manufacturing Company's claim for supplies secured by a lien which by statute took priority over mortgages. The matter was referred to a master on pleadings not before us. He made a report (not in the record) and on exceptions thereto the circuit court refused to allow interest. From that statement, in connection with the briefs and arguments of both counsel, we infer that the railway was directed to pay the principal of the claim. The case was then taken to the circuit court of appeals for the fourth circuit which certifies to this court the question, 'is interest recoverable on such a claim for the period of receivership?'\n Both parties agree that the matter is controlled by the law in Virginia, but no light is thrown on the subject by the statute of the state, which merely declares that legal interest shall continue to be at the rate of 6 per cent. Pollard's Code,  2817. No Virginia case directly in point is cited in either of the briefs, and there is a complete disagreement between counsel as to the bearing of the state decisions on the question here involved.\n On the part of the railway company it is contended that interest could not have been recovered on this claim even in an action at law. On the authority of Calton v. Bragg, 15 East, 223, 13 Revised Rep. 451, 14 Eng. Rul. Cas. 541; Newton v. Wilson, 3 Hen. & M. 470; Quincy, M. & P. R. Co. v. Humphreys, \n145 U.S. 82\n, 36 L. ed. 632, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 787, and other like cases, it is argued that the right to interest is a matter of agreement, and can be recovered as a part of the debt only where it has been reserved in the contract, or where a promise is implied from the character of the note or instrument evidencing the debt. The railway therefore \n\n[233 U.S. 261, 265]\n\u00a0\n insists that as the intervener sold the supplies, without taking a note and without securing a promise to pay interest, there was no right to recover interest as an incident of the debt, although a jury, as a matter of discretion, might have allowed it by way of damages for unreasonable delay in making payment.\n On the other hand, counsel for the Iron & Steel Company contend that as these supplies were sold on a credit of thirty days, a promise was implied to pay interest after that date as an incident of the debt itself. From Chapman v. Shepherd, 24 Gratt. 383; Craufurd v. Smith, 93 Va. 623(2), 23 S. E. 235, 25 S. E. 657; Tidball v. Shenandoah Nat. Bank, 100 Va. 741, 42 S. E. 867; Butler Bros.-Huff Co. v. Virginian R. Co. 113 Va. 28(7), 73 S. E. 441; Roberts v. Cocke, 28 Gratt. 207, and Cooper v. Coates, 21 Wall. 111, 22 L. ed. 482, we reach the conclusion that whatever may have been the English and early American rule, the tendency in Virginia, as elsewhere in this country, is to allow interest on contracts to pay money from the date that the debt becomes due. 2 Minor's Inst. 381. The sale here of supplies on thirty days' credit was not, as argued, a mere agreement for the denefit of the buyer that it should not be sued before the expiration of that time, but was the fixing of a definite date for payment of the purchase money. The acceptance of the supplies, sold on those terms, was equivalent to a promise to pay the money on that day. Atlantic Phosphate Co. v. Grafflin, \n114 U.S. 500\n, 29 L. ed. 224, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 967. As payment was not then made, the railway company was in default, and interest began to accrue as an incident of the debt, recoverable as such, and not merely as damages to be allowed in the discretion of court or jury. This appears to have been the view of the circuit court of appeals, since the interest-bearing quality of the debt seems to be assumed in the question-'Is interest recoverable on such a claim for the period of receivership?'\n In the discussion as to the answer which should be \n\n[233 U.S. 261, 266]\n\u00a0\n given that question, the railway company insists that, whether treated as part of the debt or allowed as damages, interest can only be charged against the railway because of delay due to its own fault, while here the failure to pay was due to the act of the law in taking its property into custody and operating the same by receivers in order to prevent the disruption of a great public utility. And it is true, as held in Tredegar Co. v. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. 105 C. C. A. 501, 183 Fed. 290, that as a general rule, after property of an insolvent is in custodia legis interest thereafter accruing is not allowed on debts payable out of the fund realized by a sale of the property. But that is not because the claims had lost their interest-bearing quality during that period, but is a necessary and enforced rule of distribution, due to the fact that in case of receiverships the assets are generally insufficient to pay debts in full. If all claims were of equal dignity and all bore the same rate of interest, from the date of the receivership to the date of final distribution, it would be immaterial whether the dividend was calculated on the basis of the principal alone or of principal and interest combined. But some of the debts might carry a high rate and some a low rate, and hence inequality would result in the payment of interest which accrued during the delay incident to collecting and distributing the funds. As this delay was the act of the law, no one should thereby gain an advantage of suffer a loss. For that and like reasons, in case funds are not sufficient to pay claims of equal dignity, the distribution is made only on the basis of the principal of the debt. But that rule did not prevent the running of interest during the receivership; and if, as a result of good fortune or good management, the estate proved sufficient to discharge the claims in full, interest as well as principal should be paid. Even in bankruptcy, and in the face of the argument that the debtor's liability on the debt and its incidents terminated at the date of adjudication, and as a fixed liability \n\n[233 U.S. 261, 267]\n\u00a0\n was transferred to the fund, it has been held, in the rare instances where the assets ultimately proved sufficient for the purpose, that creditors were entitled to interest accruing after adjudication. 2 Bl. Com. 488; Cf. Johnson v. Norris, -- L.R.A.(N.S.) --, 111 C. C. A. 291, 190 Fed. 460(5).\n The principle is not limited to cases of technical bankruptcy, where the assets ultimately prove sufficient to pay all debts in full, but principal as well as interest, accruing during a receivership, is paid on debts of the highest dignity, even though what remains is not sufficient to pay claims of a lower rank in full. Central Trust Co. v. Condon, 14 C. C. A. 314, 31 U. S. App. 387, 67 Fed. 84; Richmond & I. Constr. Co. v. Richmond, N. I. & B. R. Co. 34 L.R.A. 625, 15 C. C. A. 289, 31 U. S. App. 704, 68 Fed. 116; First Nat. Bank v. Ewing, 43 C. C. A. 150, 103 Fed. 190.\n The railway company relies on the statement in Thomas v. Western Car Co. \n149 \nU.S. 96, 116\n, 37 S. L. ed. 663, 670, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 824, that 'as a general rule after property of an insolvent passes into the hands of a receiver, interest is not allowed on claims against the fund.' The court there refused to allow interest on car rentals, accruing during the receivership, under an old contract, because the funds were not sufficient to pay the bonds, saying (117): 'We see no reason in departing from that [ general] rule in a case like the present where the claim [for car rentals] would be paid out of the moneys that fall far short of paying the mortgage debt.' But here, interest was paid on mortgage bonds and should therefore have been paid on a claim which by statute was given priority over the bonds. This was specially true where the property was in the hands of a receiver on the application of the debtor and of the mortgage trustees. For, manifestly, the law does not contemplate that either the debtor or the trustees can, by securing the appointment of receiver, stop the running of interest on claims of the highest dignity.\n In the brief for the railway company attention is called to the fact that the road was not in custodia legis \n\n[233 U.S. 261, 268]\n\u00a0\n under a creditors' suit, but in a proceeding to foreclose the equity of redemption. In view of that fact it is argued that the Iron & Steel Company should be remitted to its action at law against the company which is now in possession of the property. But this seems to involve matters not within the question certified by the circuit court of appeals. The property was returned to the railway company on condition that any creditor aggrieved by the failure to pay his claim might present his petition to the court and have it enforced 'to the same extent as though the receivership had continued.' As a fact interest was paid on the floating indebtedness, out of earnings made by the receivers appointed first under a bill which asked that the property be taken in charge by the court so that ultimately all creditors would be paid in full. We must assume that the court had the right to make these payments, and if so it had a like right in the case of the claim for railway supplies. No question is raised as to the power of the court to require payment of the principal of appellant's debt, and if the court could require a payment of the principal, it could also enforce the payment of the interest, which was but an incident of that debt. If the property had remained in the hands of the receiver, the lienor might have been permitted to intervene and share in the fund realized by the sale of property in the hands of receivers appointed, first, on the application of the railway, in the interest of all creditors, and continued by an order entered in the bill to foreclose the mortgage.\n It is, however, not necessary to discuss that matter further than to say that on the facts stated, interest was recoverable on the American Iron & Steel Company's claim for the period of receivership. The question certified by the Circuit Court of Appeals is answered in the affirmative. \n\n\n\n","2":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAPAPAS v. U S(1914)\nNo. 746\nArgued: April 8, 1914Decided: May 11, 1914\n\n\n\n\n Messrs. Miguel Estudillo and Theodore Martin for plaintiffs in error.\n Assistant Attorney General Adkins for defendant in error. \n\n[233 U.S. 587, 588]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n Ten persons described as Indians were, in July, 1912, indicted for the murder of William H. Stanley, a white person, 'at, upon, and within the limits of a United States Indian Reservation known as the Cahuilla Indian Reservation in the county of Riverside, within the southern division of the southern district of California, and within the jurisdiction' of the court below, in violation of  273, 275, and 328 of the Penal Code of 1909. [35 Stat. at L. 1143, 1151, chap. 321, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, pp. 1671, 1972, 1685.] As the result of a trial, four of the accused were acquitted, and the six who are plaintiffs in error here were convicted of murder in the second degree, and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment each, and prosecute this direct writ of error to reverse such conviction and sentence. There are one hundred assignments of error, but before we come to consider them we must dispose of a motion made by the government to dismiss on the ground that we are without jurisdiction because the case is susceptible only of review by the circuit court of appeals of the ninth circuit.\n Undoubtedly, under the general provisions of  128 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1133, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 193 ], power to review is lodged in the circuit court of appeals of the ninth circuit, and our authority, if any to consider the case, depends, therefore, upon whether it comes within the class of cases authorized to be brought directly here from a trial court under the provisions of  238. By such section, in addition to the power conferred to bring directly to this court a question of jurisdiction of a trial court as a Federal court, under the conditions and subject to the limitations stated, the right to directly review in a case of this kind is conferred only 'in any case that involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States; in any case in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States, or the validity or construction of any treaty made under its \n\n[233 U.S. 587, 589]\n\u00a0\n authority, is drawn in question; and in any case in which the constitution or law of a state is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States.'\n The settled significance of these provisions we have just pointed out in the case of Itow v. United States, just decided [\n233 U.S. 581\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 699], and under the principle there applied it follows that we must determine the right to direct review by ascertaining whether any of the issues enumerated in the provisions of  238 were below involved in the cause. Coming to apply this test, only three out of the matters assigned as error have any conceivable relation to the conditions defined by the statute as essential to give the right to a direct review. They are: (1) a challenge of the jurisdiction of the court below; (2) a contention as to the effect of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo [9 Stat. at L. 922]; (3) an assertion that a constitutional question was involved in the action of the trial court in admitting over objection, testimony as to a statement or admission of Ambrosio Apapas, one of the accused.\n As to the first, while it was raised below, it is obviously inadequate to sustain the right to direct review, since, under the writ of error, the whole case is brought here, and not the question of jurisdiction alone, as provided in  238, and because there in no certificate as to the jurisdiction, as required by the section. Maynard v. Hecht, \n151 U.S. 324\n, 38 L. ed. 179, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 353; Chappell v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 499, 507\n, 40 S. L. ed. 510, 512, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397; Courtney v. Pradt, \n196 \nU.S. 89, 91\n, 92 S., 49 L. ed. 398, 399, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 208.\n While the second contention based upon the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was raised in the lower court, it in no sense involved the validity or construction of the treaty, and therefore affords no support for the right to directly review. In substance the proposition concerning the treaty is this: that as the ancestors of the accused prior to the termination of the war with Mexico were citixens of Mexico, and became by the were citizens of Mexico, and became by the the state of California, they were therefore \n\n[233 U.S. 587, 590]\n\u00a0\n not amenable to prosecution in the courts of the United States for the crime of murder committed within the state of California, however much they may have been susceptible of being prosecuted for such crime in an appropriate state court. But assuming, for argument's sake, the premise based on the treaty to be sound, and disregarding, for brevity's sake, the fact that the accused were tribal Indians, leading a tribal life, and living on a tribal reservation under the control of the United States, the deduction based on the premise is so absolutely devoid of merit as not in any real sense to involve the construction of the treaty. We so say because the prosecution was for murder committed by Indians on a United States Indian reservation, and therefore was for a crime against the authority of the United States, expressly punishable by statute ( 328, Penal Code), and within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, without reference to the citizenship of the accused, as settled by a long line of anthority. United States v. Kagama, \n118 U.S. 375\n, 30 L. ed. 228, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1109; United States v. Celestine, \n215 U.S. 278\n, 54 L. ed. 195, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 93; Donnelly v. United States, \n228 U.S. 270\n, 57 L. ed. 831, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 449, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 710; United States v. Sandoval, \n231 U.S. 39\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1. Indeed, in answering the argument of the government on the motion to dismiss, if not in express terms, at least virtually, it is conceded that the two propositions we have disposed of thus are inadequate to sustain the resort to a direct writ of error. But it is urged that the third contention plainly is sufficient for that purpose, that contention, as we have said, being based upon an exception taken to the action of the trial court in receiving testimony concerning an alleged statement or admission made by one of the accused, Apapas. But we search the record in vain to find the slightest reference made to the Constitution of the United States at the time the objection referred to was taken, or anything whatever to indicate in any manner that the attention of the court below was directed to the fact that there \n\n[233 U.S. 587, 591]\n\u00a0\n was any controversy or dispute involving the Constitution of the United States.\n Under this condition, as pointed out in the case of Itow v. United States, supra, there is no ground whatever for saying that a constitutional right was involved within the exceptions created by  238 so as to justify disregarding the regular course of judicial procedure by coming directly to this court. The theory upon which it is insisted in argument that the right to direct review results because of the action of the trial court as to the admission of the statement is based upon the premise that because the Constitution guaranteed against compulsory self- incrimination, therefore any objection made to the admission of the statement or confession by the accused necessarily and inherently involved a constitutional right, and amounted to a statement of the same, although no express mention was made of the Constitution, and nothing appears to indicate that any contention whatever existed as to the significance and operation of the Constitution. But this proposition, if carried to its legitimate conclusion, would embrace every conceivable controversy as to every possible right, since, under a constitutional system of government, all rights, in their last analysis, are referable to the safeguards of the Constitution. But we need not further demonstrate the unsoundness of the contention, since it is directly in conflict with the settled rule which we have just re-stated in the Itow Case. And although to go further is superfluous, to prevent misconception or unfounded inferences as to what we decide, we say that must not be understood as holding that, even although it be assumed, for the sake of argument, that the constitutional guaranty against compulsory self-incrimination would apply to an objection made to the offer in evidence of an admission by an accused person, it would follow that such guaranty would be involved in an objection to the admission in evidence of a confession in \n\n[233 U.S. 587, 592]\n\u00a0\n the sense of  238, even if, in making the objection, the guaranty of the Constitution was expressly referred to, unless there was some real controversy concerning the meaning of the constitutional guaranty. We make this reservation because it is quite apparent that such an objecion, in the absence of some difference as to the significance of the Constitution, might well involve but the exericse of discretion as to the order or method of proff, and the calling into play of judgment to determine whether or not the proof as offered brought the question which was to be decided within the undisputed scope of the constitutional safeguard. In other words, we do not hold that any and every objection to the admission of a statement or confession of an accused can be made to involve the construction of the Constitution merely be referring to that instrument when in substance and effect there is no controversy concerning the Constitution, but only a contention as to the methods of procedure. Conceptions which are well illustrated by the record before us, where the entire argument concerning the Constitution is based on the following objection taken to the admission of the statement of the accused: Counsel for accused, 'One minute. We object that there is no proper foundation laid for a confession, as there is no evidence to show that there was any ( no) inducement or immunity offered, or what the circumstances were under which the statement was made.'\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nARCHER v.

That lying in the bed of the river in front of the lands and between the bank of the stream and the thread of the river are valuable deposits of sand and gravel which, under the laws of \n\n[233 U.S. 60, 64]\n\u00a0\n Mississippi, are on the lands of plaintiff, her right and title extending to the lands under the river to the thread of the stream.\n That the Gravel Company entered into a contract with the Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Railroad Company to supply sand and gravel for the purpose of grading and raising the line of the railroad, and that the Gravel Company employed the E. A. Voight Company to dredge from the bed of the river in front of the lands of plaintiff, and between the river bank and the thread of the stream, the sand and gravel required by it. That the Voight Company is dredging the same over the protest of plaintiff, and has taken therefrom large quantities of sand and gravel which it has delivered to the Gravel Company, and the latter company is selling the same to the public and to the railroad company.\n That the Gravel Company has refused to cease dredging or to make compensation therefor. That petitioner does not know how much of such material has been taken, but great quantities thereof have been taken, the amounts of which are peculiarly within the knowledge of the Gravel Company.\n That the dredging constitutes a continuing trespass upon the lands and property of plaintiff, and she is entitled to have the same restrained and to an injunction and accounting, and that she is remediless except in a court of equity. She prayed for such relief.\n The deeds constituting her title were attached to the bill. The deed conveying title to her, after describing the lands and stating they consisted of 1,300 acres, contained the expression, 'excepting such parts thereof as have been washed away by the river.'\n The suit, on the petition of the Gravel Company, was removed to the United States circuit court for the southern district, western division, of the state of Mississippi, in which court the Gravel Company filed a demurrer \n\n[233 U.S. 60, 65]\n\u00a0\n under nine specifications, alleging want of equity in the bill because of an adequate remedy at law, and want of substance in it because petitioner was not the owner of the sand and gravel in the bed of the river.\n The demurrer was sustained, and as plaintiff declined to amend her bill, a decree was entered dismissing it. The decree was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals without opinion. A petition for rehearing was made, which was denied without comment, and we are without knowledge of the views of the lower courts or of the grounds upon which their judgments were based, except that counsel for plaintiff asserts the circuit court sustained the demurrer 'solely on the ground of the jurisdiction of the court.'\n The grounds of demurrer, we think, and the contentions of the parties, present two propositions-(1) the ritht of plaintiff to relief in equity and (2) that she does not show ownership of the property in question as a matter of law. In the latter is involved the question whether a grant of lands bounded by the waters of the Mississippi river, a navigable stream above tidewater, extends to the thread of the channel.\n The first proposition is easily disposed of, and, passing by the prayer for discovery and an accounting, we think the bill shows a continuing trespass of such nature and of such character of injury that remedies at law by actions for damages would be inadequate, and would, besides, entail repeated litigation. Warren Mills v. New Orleans Seed Co. 65 Miss. 391, 7 Am. St. Rep. 671, 4 So. 298. Nor is this conclusion disturbed by the fact urged by the Gravel Company, that plaintiff prays for an injunction to be granted only after the hearing of the cause, and although then the rights of the contestants may be finally adjudicated in her favor or the dredging might cease before that time. The contention is somewhat strange. A plaintiff's right of suit cannot be defeated by a mere supposition that he or she may be successful, or that \n\n[233 U.S. 60, 66]\n\u00a0\n the defendant may cease to offend against the right asserted. It is in the hope of one or the other of such results that the suit is brought against a present or threatened violation of rights. If wrongs are endured in the meantime, there is no loss of rights or remedies.\n We are therefore brought to the second proposition, Is plaintiff the owner of the sand and the gravel in the bed of the river?\n The law of Mississippi is an element in the case. It first found elaborate discussion and decision in Morgan v. Reading, 3 Smedes & M. 366, and it was held that the common law was adopted for the government of the Mississippi territory, and that the line of the territory was the middle of the Mississippi river, and that it hence followed that the rights of riparian owners on the east shore must be determined in the state of Mississippi by the common law, and that it was a principle of that law 'that he who owns the bank, owns to the middle of the river, subject to the easement of navigation.' 3 Kent, Com. 5th ed. 427, and notes were cited.\n The case involved the right of the owner of the bank of the river to charge for mooring purposes on the river above low water mark. The right was sustained upon the principle which we have stated above.\n The same principle was announced in the Magnolia v. Marshall, 39 Miss. 109. The case was said by the court to be identical in its facts with Morgan v. Reading. The opinion is too long to review or to quote from at any length. It left no case or authority unreviewed, nor any consideration untouched, and carefully distinguished the public and private interest in the Mississippi river, the court saying: 'There is therefore no inconsistency, but, on the contrary, as before suggested, perfect harmony between the jus privatum of riparian ownership in public fresh-water streams, to the middle of \n\n[233 U.S. 60, 67]\n\u00a0\n the river, and the jus publicum of free navigation thereof. The soil is granted to the riparian proprietor, subject to this public easement.' And, again, in criticism of what the court considered an untenable view expressed by the court of another state, it said: 'This general doctrine is as old as the Year-books, that, prima facie, every proprietor on each bank of a river is entitled to the land covered with water to the middle of the stream.' This being declared to be the law of the state, judgment was entered for charges for the use by the Magnolia of a landing on the river.\n But it is said by the Gravel Company that according to the agreed facts 'there was no use or occupation' of the lands of the plaintiff in the case 'beyond high-water mark; the only portion used and occupied being the bank of the river between high and low water mark;' and that the court, identifying the facts with those in the Morgan Case, said: 'What are the rights of the riparian owners, and what the jus publicum incident to the free navigation of the Mississippi, are questions there presented, and are the main questions here again presented.' This statement, it is hence contended, limits the binding authority of the opinions 'as judicial determinations to a decision of what are the rights of a riparian owner between high and low water marks as connected with the rights of the public in using the Mississippi river as a public highway and navigable stream.' And it is further contended that that 'question is in no way connected with the ownership of the bed of the stream, or ownership of the gravel and sand in the channel of the stream,' It is therefore insisted that 'the case called for nothing more than an decision as to these bank rights, and if more was intended by the judge who delivered the opinion, it was purely obiter.'\n We cannot concur in this view. The court deduced the right to charge for the occupation of the water between high and low water marks from the ownership of the soil \n\n[233 U.S. 60, 68]\n\u00a0\n to the middle thread of the stream. The elaborate reasoning and research of the opinion were directed to demonstrate that under the common law of the state, riparian ownership extends ad filum, and, as a consequence, embraces the right to charge for the use of the water between high and low water marks for landing purposes, although not for purposes of transit. The case is cited as having that purport in 3 Kent Com. 14th ed. *427, where the dootrine of riparian rights as they obtain in the states of the Union is considered and the cases collected. In the sixth edition of Kent the Magnolia Case is commended as 'a frank and many support of the binding force of the common law, on which American jurisprudence essentially rests.' See also Shively v. Bowlby, \n152 U.S. 1\n, 38 L. ed. 331, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 548, for a discussion by this court of riparian rights.\n The Morgan and Magnolia Cases were cited in New Orleans, M. & C. R. Co. v. Frederic, 46 Miss. 1, 9, 10, to sustain 'the right of the owner of the land on the bank of the river to the thread of the stream, subject only to a right of passage thereon as a highway when the stream admits it.'\n It is further urged that the argument in the Morgan Case 'in support of the common-law doctrine as to the ebb and flow of the tide constituting a navigable stream is in direct opposition and antagonism to the reasoning and opinion of this court in the frequently cited and approved case of the Genesee Chief, 12 How. 443, 13 L. ed. 1058, decided in 1851, nine years before the opinion of the state court was handed down.' Other cases are also cited in which it is decided that riparian rights pertain to the bank, and distinguished, as it is asserted, between rights admittedly riparian and rights of ownership of or to the bed of the river. We need not enter into a discussion of those cases, or assign their exact authority. This court has decided that it is a question of local law whether the title to the beds of the navigable rivers of the United States is in the \n\n[233 U.S. 60, 69]\n\u00a0\n state in which the rivers are situated or in the owners of the land bordering upon such rivers. Packer v. Bird, \n137 U.S. 661\n, 34 L. ed. 819, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 210; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co. \n229 U.S. 53\n, 57 L. ed. 1063, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 667; Kaukauna Water Power Co. v. Green Bay & M. Canal Co. \n142 U.S. 254\n, 35 L. ed. 1004, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 173; St. Louis v. Rutz, \n138 U.S. 226\n, 34 L. ed. 941, 11 Sup. Ct.

Soulard, 24 How. 41, 16 L. ed. 604.\n Plaintiff owning the land to the middle of the stream, it would seem to follow that she must have such property in its soil as to resist a trespasser upon it, such as the bill alleges the Gravel Company to be. The right, however, is denied, and it is said that she is powerless to prevent the Gravel Company from dredging in front of her land because, under the laws of the United States, she herself could not do so without permission from the Secretary of War. For this,  7 of the rivers and harbors appropriation act of September 19 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 454 chap. 907), is cited as making it unlawful for any person to excavate or fill, or in any manner to alter or modify, the course, location, condition, or capacity of the channel of said navigable water of the United States unless approved and authorized by the Secretary of War. Whether if she took gravel from the front of her land she would incur the condemnation of this act it is not necessary to decide. She certainly had such an interest in the conditions to prevent one without right from disturbing them. We cannot help observing that the Gravel Company by its conduct has given an interpretation of the act against its contention, unless, indeed, it wishes to confess itself a violator of public law in order to escape responsibility for a private injury.\n The Gravel Company tries to avoid this situation, saying that a violation of the law cannot be imputed to it because it cannot be assumed that the 'extensive and continued dredging, as alleged in the bill, affecting necessarily the channel of the river, would be undertaken without proper authorization and authority, or that \n\n[233 U.S. 60, 70]\n\u00a0\n the proper officers of the government would have allowed these operations to continue.' The supposition is easily answered. There is no scheme of improvement of navigation suggested by the bill, and it cannot be supposed that the Secretary of War would authorize the Gravel Company to take material from the river for commercial purpose, and the bill alleges such to be the purpose. Besides, if the Gravel Company had authority from the Secretary of War, it is a matter of defense to be pleaded.\n The Gravel Company further charges that, considering the allegations of the bill and the muniments of title attached to it, there is exhibited a possible failure to plead such title in plaintiff as would carry with it even a qualified ownership in the bed of the stream. We do not think so. At any rate, the bill is sufficient against a general demurrer.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATCHISON, T & S F R. CO. v. U S(1914)\nNo. 590\nArgued: Decided: January 26, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 199, 200]\n\u00a0\n In 1909, associations, representing California fruit growers, filed with the Commerce Commission complaints against numerous railroad companies, attacking the freight and refrigeration charges on citrus fruit shipped from California to Eastern points. Much testimony was taken, from which it appeared that the orange crop amounted to about 50,000 cars per annum, of which the 20,000 shipped in warm weather required some form of refrigeration in order to keep the fruit in condition for use at the end of the journey. At the close of the first hearing, June 11, 1910, the Commission held (19 Inters. Com. Rep. 148) that $1.15 per cwt. was a reasonable freight rate on oranges. Other questions in the case were postponed until January 14, 1911, when the Commission made a report (20 Inters. Com. Rep. 106) as to the reasonableness of the carriers' charges of $62.50 per car for refrigeration and $30 for services in shipments pre- cooled by the consignor.\n The Commission found that in refrigeration by the carriers they furnished all the ice and performed all of the services, including re- icing en route. It found that there was a total of about 11 tons of ice furnished, but, owing to the melting, the average weight of the ice hauled was 8,000 lbs., the freight on which to Chicago was $.25 per 100. It cost something to repair the bunkers, and the Commission recognized the right to include an additional sum to cover risk and profit. \n\n[232 U.S. 199, 201]\n\u00a0\n The total revenue of $345.30 from such shipments was made up of the following items:\n Freight on 27,200 lbs. of oranges @ $1.15 $312.80 Cost of 11 tons of ice $30 Freight on 8,000 lbs. average weight of ice hauled @ $ .25 20 Damage to bunkers 5 Sum to cover risk and profit 7.50 62.50 ___\n Gross receipts $375.30 Less cost of ice 30.00 ___\n Freight and refrigeration charges $345.30\n The Commission found that the charge of $62.50 for refrigeration services was reasonable.\n It further appeared that the government had conducted certain experiments with a view of determining whether an advantage would not de derived from pre-cooling the fruit before the bunkers were filled with ice. There was testimony that the carriers had reached the conclusion that if the fruit was pre-cooled before the movement of the car began, there would be a corresponding saving in the amount of ice needed in the bunkers. They accordingly had erected plants at which the fruit could be pre-cooled, and included such pre-cooling service in the regular refrigeration charge of $ 62.50.\n Certain shippers claimed that better results were obtained where the fruit was pre-cooled immediately after it was taken from the grove and before it was placed in the car. They therefore adopted a method in which the shipper chills the fruit, cools the car, furnishes the ice, and fills the bunkers at a cost to himself of $32.50. The carrier, for its services in connection with hauling such pre-cooled shipment, charged $30, intending thereby to make the rates on \n\n[232 U.S. 199, 202]\n\u00a0\n pre-cooled fruits the same, whether the pre-cooling was by the shipper or the carrier. In determining whether this $30 was a reasonable charge for service rendered by the carrier in hauling fruit pre-cooled by the shipper, the Commission said (20 Inters. Com. Rep. 120) that no re-icing was necessary en route, and that 'it would be a liberal estimate to put the average weight of ice during the entire journey at 5,000 lbs. For the hauling of this ice the carriers are entitled to fair compensation, as they are in the case of standard refrigeration.' There is also an 'expense in providing and keeping in repair the ice bunkers. . . . The carrier is, therefore, entitled to this additional cost, which is about $5 per car per trip one way.' (Ibid.)\n Where the fruit is pre-cooled by the shipper, the boxes are packed so much closer together that the load is one sixth greater than in case of shipments pre-cooled and refrigerated by the carrier. The result is that the revenue from a car of fruit pre-cooled by the shipper would be--\n\n Freight on 33,000 lbs. of oranges at $1.15 $379.50 Freight on 5,000 lbs. of ice at 25 cents per hundred 12.50 Damages to bunkers (and profit allowed?) 7.50 ___ $399.50\n or, $54 more than the revenue of $345.30 from a car pre-cooled and refrigerated by the carrier.\n The Commission further said: 'As bearing upon the reasonableness of the rate, the carriers showed the cost of the movement of these oranges per gross ton,-that is, per ton of combined weight of car and of contents, as compared with other articles,-claiming that this was the true basis upon which to fix rates. So treating these pre-cooled shipments, it will be found that the carrier receives more per gross ton for handling the pre- cooled car than for either the ventilated or the refrigerated shipment. By every canon of ratemaking which has been applied by carriers in the past, or which is relied upon by them now, \n\n[232 U.S. 199, 203]\n\u00a0\n these pre-cooled shipments, at the standard rate, without additional compensation, are better business than either the ventilated or the refrigerated movement. Clearly, these growers who have devised and perfected this system of shipment should not be compelled to pay for the privilege of using it more than the fair cost to the carrier of providing the additional facilities which are not included in the ventilated rate, with a fair profit.'\n The report concluded as follows: 'We are of the opinion that the pre- cooling charge of $30 per car is unreasonable, and that this charge should not exceed $7.50 per car, . . . but the defendants may, as a condition of making this charge, require that pre-cooled cars be loaded seven tiers wide and two tiers high, and may provide by their tariffs a proper minimum to accomplish this result, the amount of which would depend upon the length of the car.' 20 Inters. Com. Rep. 121, 123.\n The carriers, in obedience to this order, put in a tariff of $7.50 for pre-cooling services, but at once filed another tariff, effective July, 1911, reciting that 'the privilege heretofore permitted to shippers of citrus fruit to pre-ice carload shipments is withdrawn, the carriers retaining and exercising the exclusive right and control of furnishing and doing all icing and refrigeration of citrus fruit in all cases where shipper does not specifically request or direct shipments to move solely under ventilation.'\n Immediately thereafter the orange-growers associations filed proceedings to cancel this withdrawal tariff, and to compel the carriers to continue to extend to shippers the old privilege of pre-cooling at the new rate of $7.50. At the hearing the evidence and report of the Commission in the former case were stipulated into the record, and, on April 8, 1912 (23 Inters. Com. Rep. 267, 271), the Commission held that the shippers had the right to the pre-cooling \n\n[232 U.S. 199, 204]\n\u00a0\n privilege, and again ruled that $7.50 was a reasonable charge for the services rendered by the carriers.\n The railroad companies then filed a petition in the commerce court attacking the original order of January 14, 1911 (fixing $7.50 as a reasonable charge on pre-cooled shipments), and the last order of April 8, 1912 (requiring the roads to permit pre-cooled shipments at that sum), contending that shippers had no right to ice the bunkers. They also insisted that the $7.50 rate was confiscatory, and did not equal the $17. 50, which the Commission itself had found to be the actual cost of services rendered in connection with pre-cooled shipments. The carriers thereupon prayed that both orders should be annulled and set aside.\n The commerce court (204 Fed. 647) adopted the finding of the Commission that in pre-cooled shipments the revenue was $54 greater than in the railroad's method of refrigeration, and concluded by saying that, in view of that fact, 'we do not think that the petitioners have any valid complaint to make of the chargo of $7.50 per car, established by the Commission.' It further held that under the facts appearing in the record, the shipper had the right to furnish the ice in pre-cooled shipments, and thereupon it dismissed the petition. The case was then brought here by appeal.\n Messrs. Gardiner Lathrop, F. H. Wood, W. F. Herrin, Robert Dunlap, T. J. Norton,\n\n\n[232 U.S. 199, 209]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, Special Assistant\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, and Solicitor General Davis for the United States. \n\n[232 U.S. 199, 210]\n\u00a0\n Mr. P.

Foster for Arlington Heights Fruit Exchange.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Lamar:\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n There are many cases between shipper and carrier in which each insists that the other is bound to furnish service or facilities connected with the transportation of freight. The present record, however, presents an instance where both parties are contending for the privilege of supplying an article needed in the proper shipment of fruit,-the consignor claiming that icing is a necessary part of the loading, which he is authorized to supply; while the carriers insist that icing is a part of refrigeration, by statute made transportation, which they are bound to provide and for which they are entitled to collect reasonable compensation. The determination of these conflict- \n\n[232 U.S. 199, 213]\n\u00a0\n ing claims necessitates an examination of the two methods under which, in warm weather, oranges are shipped from California to the East.\n In what is called standard refrigeration, the boxes, of the aggregate weight of 27,200 pounds, are so placed as to leave spaces between them wide enough to admit of a free circulation of air chilled by ice in the bunkers. Subsequently the carriers put in a system of pre-cooling, under which, after the cars had been loaded, they were taken from the point of shipment to refrigerating plants owned by the carriers, where whole trainloads are pre-cooled at one time by means of blasts of very cold air driven into the car through and around the boxes. At the end of three or four hours the fruit is sufficiently chilled, the bunkers are then filled with about 10 tons of ice, furnished by the carrier, and the train is started on its journey to the East,-the bunkers being re-iced from time to time as needed at stations along the route. For this entire service the Commission held that the carrier's charge of $62.50 was reasonable.\n A different method obtains where the icing of the car is done by the shipper at his own expense. In that class of cases the oranges are taken from the grove directly to a cold room having a temperature of about 33 F. There the boxes are allowed to remain for periods of from twenty-four to forty-eight hours, and until the fruit is chilled to the center. When thus pre-cooled. the boxes are ready for shipment. A refrigerator car is then placed on the track opposite the door of the cold room of the warehouse with which it is connected by a collapsible inclosed passageway, so arranged as to exclude the outside air, while at the same time allowing that from the cold room to enter and cool the interior of the car. Through this passageway the oranges are trucked from the warehouse to the car, and, as they have been chilled to the center, the boxes are packed close together, forming a solid mass weighing \n\n[232 U.S. 199, 214]\n\u00a0\n 33,000 lbs., with a temperature of about 35 F. The doors and vents of the car are promptly and tightly closed, the bunkers are immediately filled with unusually large cakes of ice, in order to reduce the rate of melting, and the fruit is then forwarded under a filed tariff which provides that re-icing is unnecessary, and that the shipper will make no claim for damage occasioned by failure to re-ice in transit. For their services in connection with such pre-cooled shipments the carriers were allowed to charge $7.50, but the Commission refused to permit them to charge for the ice needed to keep the fruit cool between warehouse and destination.\n\n 1. \nThis ruling is attacked by the appellants, who contend that icing is a part of refrigeration, which  1 of the Hepburn bill makes a part of the transportation they are bound to furnish upon reasonable request. They insist that in order to meet the duty thus imposed by statute, they have been compelled at great expense to erect immense plants where trainloads of fruit can be cooled, and where an enormous quantity of ice is manufactured for refrigeration purposes. They argue that, being bound to furnish all necessary icing and reicing, and having at great cost prepared to furnish the supply, it is not only just, but a right given by statute, that they should be allowed to provide all needed icing or refrigeration at a rate to be approved by the Commission.\n Whatever transportation service or facility the law requires the carrier to supply they have the right to furnish. They can therefore use their own cars, and cannot be compelled to accept those tendered by the shipper on \n . . . The term 'transportation' shall include . . . all services in connection with the receipt, delivery, . . . ventilation, refrigeration, or icing . . . of property transported; and it shall be the duty of every carrier . . . to provide and furnish such transportation upon reasonable request therefor. (34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1285.) \n\n[232 U.S. 199, 215]\n\u00a0\n condition that a lower freight rate be charged. So, too, they can furnish all the ice needed in refrigeration; for this is not only a duty and a right, under  1 of the Hepburn bill, but an economic necessity, due to the fact that the carriers cannot be expected to prepare to meet the demand, and then let the use of their plants depend upon haphazard calls, under which refrigeration can be demanded by all shippers at one time and by only a few at another.\n This contention was sustained by the Commission, which recognized that 'the shipper has no right to provide refrigeration himself to-day and call upon the railroad company for that service to-morrow. To permit such a course is to demoralize the service of the defendants, and to prevent them from discharging their duty with economy and efficiency. . . . It is the duty of the carrier to furnish refrigeration upon reasonable demand, and in so far as the furnishing of that refrigeration is a part of the service rendered by the carrier, the carrier may insist upon its right to furnish that service exclusively.'\n\n 2. \nBut of course this does not mean, that because the carriers have ice on hand, they can compel the shipper to have his fruit refrigerated, when, on account of the state of the weather, or for other cause, he prefers to have it forwarded under ventilation only. When, however, ice is actually needed and is actually used, the question arises as to whether icing is a part of preparation which can be done by the shipper, or a part of refrigeration (transportation) which, by statute, the carrier has the exclusive right to furnish.\n To this question no answer can be given that will apply in all cases. For in the shipment of fruit, as in that of other articles, it is impossible to lay down a rule which definitely fixed what loading includes and by whom it must be done. Nor is there any consistent practice on this subject, since from reported cases it appears that the \n\n[232 U.S. 199, 216]\n\u00a0\n claims of the parties are based rather on interest than on some definite principle. Sometimes the shipper, as here, insists on the right to load and provide necessary appliances. At other times he demands that such service and appliances be furnished by the railroad company. Conversely, the carriers sometimes claim, as here, the right to furnish service and facilities, while in other cases insisting that one or both must be supplied by the consignor. Cf. National Wholesale Lumber Dealers' Asso. v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. 14 Inters. Com. Rep. 154; Schultz-Hanson Co. v. Southern P. Co. 18 Inters. Com. Rep. 234; Re Allowance for Stoves & Lining of Cars, 26 Inters. Com. Rep. 681; Re Western Classification, 25 Inters. Com. Rep. 497.\n These inconsistent and conflicting demands serve to emphasize the fact that, before the haul actually begins, the right or duty of each party, where not absolutely fixed by statute, must be decided with reference to the special facts of each case.\n As a general rule, the carrier loads all freight tendered in less than carload lots, while the consignor loads in all cases where, for his convenience, the car is placed at his warehouse or on public team tracks. This practice has grown up not only because the work can be more satisfactorily performed by the owner, but also because it is impossible for railroad companies economically to load cars at private warehouses or on those tracks where vehicles of the consignor or consignee come and go at the direction of the owner. 25 Inters. Com. Rep. 490.\n\n 3. \nBut loading may involve more than the mere placing of the freight on the car, since the character of the shipment may be such as to require the furnishing and placing of stakes, racks, blocks, and binders needed to make the transportation safe; or, the freight may be such as to require special covering, packing, icing, or heating, in order to preserve the merchandise in condition fit for use at the end of the journey. Who is to furnish these needed facilities may be quite as uncertain as who is to place the \n\n[232 U.S. 199, 217]\n\u00a0\n freight on the car; and can only be determined by considering the character of the shipment, the place where the loading begins, and who can most economically perform the service required.\n Neither party has a right to insist upon a wasteful or expensive service for which the consumer must ultimately pay. The interest of the public is to be considered as well as that of shippers and carriers,-their rights in turn having been adjusted by a reduction in the rate, if the loading is done in whole or in part by the shipper; and by an increase in the rate where the loading is done in whole or in part by the carrier. But, by whomsoever done, the loading must be such as to fit the freight for shipment; and when-by statutory requirement, by valid order of the Commission, or by the carriers' voluntary act-the car is placed at the consignor's warehouse to be loaded by the shipper, he may not only put the freight on the car, but may do all other acts required to fit the freight for its proper shipment,-at least, until, under a tariff regularly filed, the carrier offers to do what is necessary to secure or preserve what has thus been placed on its car for transportation. The refrigeration and pre- cooling offered by the carrier to shippers of pre-cooled fruit were found not to be the equivalent of the method adopted by the shipper.\n\n 4. \nIn the present case the carriers concede that in pre-cooling shipments the consignor had the right to take all of the steps for preparation except the last. They concede that he had the right to pre- cool the fruit, to pre-cool the car, to place the boxes on board the car, to stop the vents, and seal the doors. But they deny that he could ice the bunkers, even though that was necessary to the complete preparation, or loading, needed in that particular class of shipments, and without which the fruit would be damaged by the rise in temperature, occurring during the time the car is being hauled from the warehouse of the shipper to the icing station of the carrier. Such delay in \n\n[232 U.S. 199, 218]\n\u00a0\n filling bunkers would nullify most of the advantage of the expensive chilling of fruit and car necessary in the pre-cooling shipments,- permitted, if not originally encouraged, by the carrier. The privilege was withdrawn,-not because the railroad companies were in position to furnish the ice at the proper time and place, but solely because the Commission had reduced the carriers' charge on pre-cooled oranges from $30 to $7.50 per car.\n The icing may have been so related to refrigeration as to authorize the carriers to render that service. But manifestly they could not be expected to build refrigerating plants near each warehouse; and, the carrier not being in a position to do such icing, the consignor had the same right to provide the necessary supply that he would have had to ice a shipment of fish, to furnish and place standards to secure lumber on an open car, or to fasten to the floor articles which otherwise might be damaged by the jerks and jolts of a moving train. In the absence, therefore, of the carriers' offer, under a filed tariff, to furnish ice at the time and place needed in pre-cooled shipments, or to substitute a service of equal value at practically the same cost, they had no right to prevent the consignor from filling the bunkers so as to fit the freight for proper transportation.\n\n 5. \nThe tariffs, withdrawing the pre-cooling privilege after July, 1911, would have changed the practice, recognized by the carriers themselves and actually approved by the Commission's order fixing $7.50 for the carrier's services in connection with such practice. As the withdrawal 'affected a practice and a rate,' the Commission had power to cancel that tariff and to require the carriers to conform to the order establishing the $7.50 charge in pre-cooled shipments. Such an order was justified by the provisions of  15 [of 1887, 24 Stat. at L. 384, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3165 as amended by  4] of the Hepburn act ( 34 Stat. at L. 589, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1297), which authorizes the Commission, after a hearing, to determine whether rates, or practices affecting rates, are unreasonable, to determine what practice in respect to trans- \n\n[232 U.S. 199, 219]\n\u00a0\n portation is just, and to require the carrier to conform to those prescribed by the Commission. \n\n 6. \nThe appellants insist, however, that even if the shippers are entitled to furnish the ice, the carriers are entitled to pay for hauling it. They claim that the charge of $7.50 is confiscatory because it does not cover what the Commission found to be the actual cost of the carriers' pre-cooling service. They point to the fact that the rate of $1.15 per cwt. on oranges was found to be reasonable, without regard to the character of the shipment, and whether the fruit moved under ventilation, standard refrigeration, or pre-cooling shipment,-additional sums being allowed for furnishing or hauling ice needed in transportation of the fruit. They admit that more revenue is derived from a carload of pre-cooled fruit, weighing 33,000 lbs., than from a car where the load weighs 27,200, but insist that the greater revenue is because of a greater service rendered and a greater weight hauled. On the authority of Interstate Commerce Commission v. Stickney, \n215 \nU.S. 98, 105\n, 54 S. L. ed. 112, 113 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66, they contend that the receipt of a fair return for carrying 33, 000 lbs. of fruit affords no reason for compelling them to haul 5,000 lbs. of ice 2,000 miles for nothing, when, as found by the Commission, the actual cost of the haul is $12.50.\n The order does not show the items going to make up the $7.50 charge. In the brief for the Commission it was\n Sec. 15. The Commission is authorized . . . whenever, after full hearing . . . it shall be of the opinion that any of the rates or charges . . . for the transportation of persons or property . . . or that any regulations or practices . . . affecting such rates are unjust or unreasonable . . . to determine and prescribe what will be the just and reasonable rate . . . and what regulation or practice in respect to such transportation is just, fair, and reasonable to be thereafter followed; and to make an order that the carrier shall cease and desist from such violation, . . . and shall conform to the regulation or practice so prescribed. \n\n[232 U.S. 199, 220]\n\u00a0\n said to include $5 for damage to the bunkers and $2.50 for profit. And since the report shows that the carriers were also entitled to $12.50 for hauling the ice, a charge of only $7.50 for a $20 service would at first blush appear to be not only unreasonable, but confiscatory. But the order is to be read in connection with the report of which it forms a part. When so read, it is evident that the Commission did not intend to require the carriers to haul 5,000 1bs. of ice without carriers to haul 5,000 lbs. of ice without that the haul of the ice was so much a part of the haul of the pre-cooled freight, that the expense could properly be treated as included or absorbed in the rate on the fruit itself. Cf. Farrar Lumber Co. v. Nashville C. & St. L. R. Co. 25 Inters. Com. Rep. 25; Swift & Co. v. Missouri P. R. Co. 22 Inters. Com. Rep. 385.\n The cost of such haul was $12.50,-equivalent to 3.8 on the 33,000 lbs. of oranges in a pre-cooled shipment, and as a mere matter of figures, it was immaterial to the carriers whether they were permitted to charge $1.11. 2 on thr fruit and $12.50 for the ice, or $1.15 on the fruit alone without any distinct charge for transporting the ice. In either event, the revenue received was more than that derived from a car of standard refrigeration, without corresponding increase of cost.\n\n 7. \nThe claim that the order modifies the established rate of $1.15, and reduces it to $1.11.2 in pre-cooled shipments, thereby discriminating against the small fruit grower and those who forward under ventilation, or under the carriers' method of refrigeration, is not an issue presented by any assignment of error in this record, even if the carriers were in position to make such a contention. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. \n218 \nU.S. 88, 109\n, 54 S. L. ed. 946, 957, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 651. There is no claim in this case that such rate, thus distributed, is unreasonable.\n\n 8. \nWhat is a proper rate on fruit in precooling shipments, or a fair charge for hauling necessary ice or rendering other transportation services, are all rate-making \n\n[232 U.S. 199, 221]\n\u00a0\n matters committed to the Commission. It may determine what shall be the difference in rate between carload and less than carload lots; it may decide whether the difference in revenue, due to a difference in method of loading, warrants a difference in the rate on carload shipments of the same article. It may prescribe the form in which schedules shall be prepared and arranged ( 6), and may approve tariffs stating that the single rate includes both the line haul and accessorial services absorbed in the rate. Conversely, it may prescribe a tariff fixing a through rate which includes not only the haul of the fruit, but the haul of the ice necessary to keep the fruit in condition. All these are matters committed to the decision of the administrative body, which, in each instance, is required to fix reasonable rates and establish reasonable practices. The courts have not been vested with any such power. They cannot make rates. They cannot interfere with rates fixed or practices established by the Commission unless it is made plainly to appear that those ordered are void. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union P. R.

ROBINSON(1914)\nNo. 450\nArgued: February 26, 1914Decided: April 6, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. S. T. Bledsoe, J. R. Cottingham, and George M. Green for plaintiff in error. \n\n[233 U.S. 173, 174]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John B. Daish, H. H. Smith, and J. W. Beller for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 173, 176]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The defendant in error, plaintiff below, and herein so designated, brought suit in the district court of Lincoln county, Oklahoma, to recover for damages to a race horse, the property of the plaintiff, which was shipped with \n\n[233 U.S. 173, 177]\n\u00a0\n other race horses from Kansas City, Missouri, to Lawrence, Kansas. Upon verdict in favor of the plaintiff, judgment was entered accordingly, which was affirmed by the supreme court of Oklahoma (36 Okla. 435, 129 Pac. 20).\n The plaintiff alleged that the contract of consignment was a verbal one, made by calling up the agent of the railway company at Kansas City by telephone on the day the shipment was made, advising him that the plaintiff had race horses which he desired to ship to Lawrence in time for the races next day; that he was informed by the agent that such shipment could be made, and that if the horses could be loaded between 4 and 6 o'clock of that afternoon they would be carried by the fast freight known as the 'Red Ball,' making no stops for local freight, and reaching Lawrence about 12 o'clock that night; that it was agreed between them that the shipment should be made by that train; that the plaintiff was instructed where to bring the horses, and informed that a car would be placed to receive them; and that the horses were taken to the place designated by the agent, loaded into a car between 5 and 6 o'clock in the afternoon, the car being closed and labeled 'Red Ball,' meaning that it should go with the 'Red Ball' train on that evening. The car was not taken out that night, and there was testimony tending to show that it was switched about in the yard and on the next morning was started with local freight to Lawrence, arriving there about 2 o'clock next day, too late for the races. And there was evidence that the horse of the plaintiff had been badly injured through the negligence of the defendant.\n By an amended answer the railway company set up the fact that the shipment was in interstate commerce, and the filing and approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission of certain tariff rates duly posted, as required by the act, wherein it was provided:\n'(A) Rates named in  2 apply on shipments \n\n[233 U.S. 173, 178]\n\u00a0\n of ordinary live stock, where contracts are executed by shippers on blanks furnished by these companies, and are based on the declared valuation by the shipper at time contract is signed, not to exceed the following:\n\n'Each horse or pony (gelding, mare, stallion), mule or jack, $100. Each ox, bull, or steer, $50. Each cow, $30. Each calf, $10. Each hog, $10. Each sheep or goat, $3.\n\n'(B) Where the declared value exceeds the above, an addition of 25 per cent will be added to the rate for each 100 per cent or fractional part thereof of additional declared valuation per head. Animals exceeding in value 800 per head will be taken only by special arrangement.\n\n'(C) Table of rates named will be charged on shipments of live stock made with limitation of company's liability at common law, and under this status shippers will have the choice of executing or accepting contracts for shipments of live stock with or without limitation of liability and rates accordingly;' and alleged that the shipper obtained the benefit of the reduced rate applicable to the value fixed in the written contract governing the shipment of horses; that the shipment was made under the tariffs so filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, and that the rates and liability of the company were governed by the act of Congress. The plaintiff contended that the complete contract was made in the oral arrangement without reference to or mention of any particular rate or the value of the stock other than that it was a race horse. Taking the most favorable view of the testimony for the plaintiff, it tended to show that after the car had started from the place of loading, an agent of the company presented to the plaintiff a printed contract made in conformity to the schedules filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, but without calling his attention to its provisions, without \n\n[233 U.S. 173, 179]\n\u00a0\n informing him of its contents, and without procuring his assent to the terms therein stated, although he admitted executing the contract.\n\n The trial court charged the jury over the exception of the railway company that if they found that at the time of the shipment the contract was entered into by the plaintiff and the defendant, and that the plaintiff represented to the defendant that the horse did not exceed $100 in value, and that the defendant relied upon the representation, and gave a rate less than the regular one for that class of shipment, and was misled by such misrepresentation, and induced to fix a lower rate than the regular one, and if they found the defendant guilty of negligence, they were limited in their findings to the sum of $100; but that if they found that the representation was not made by the plaintiff, but was arbitrarily inserted by defendant, or printed in its contract when signed, then the plaintiff was not bound by the limitation, and they should find his actual damages. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $1,500.\n Upon writ of error to the supreme court of Oklahoma that court affirmed the judgment rendered in the district court and held:\n'Where a shipment of live stock is made under a verbal contract, and where every move made, every step taken toward a shipment, up to and including a complete consignment and surrender of control by the shipper, the starting in transit of the shipment, and the assumption of liability for negligence by the carrier, is all under and pursuant to such parol agreement, and after this a printed shipping contract is presented to the shipper to sign, he has the right to assume that it embodies the terms of the verbal agreement, and the carrier will not be permitted to escape liabilities accruing to the shipper under the verbal agreement by reason of certain provisions in the written contract at variance with the parol contract, \n\n[233 U.S. 173, 180]\n\u00a0\n unless the shipper's attention has been called to such provisions and fair opportunity given him to assent to same.'\n\n It is thus seen that the defendant specially set up a defense under the interstate commerce act, a Federal statute, which, if denied to him, was an adverse ruling of Federal right which would warrant the bringing of the case to this court from the highest court of a state under former  709 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575), now  237 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 227]. It is apparent from the foregoing statement that the Federal question now presented involves the ruling of the state court denying to the carrier the benefit of the interstate commerce act, a compliance with which was set up in the amended answer and supported by testimony tending to show the truth of the allegations thereof.\n That the effect of the Carmack amendment to the Hepburn act ( 7, act of June 29, 1906, 34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1288) was to give to the Federal jurisdiction control over interstate commerce, and to make supreme the Federal legislation regulating liability for property transported by common carriers in interstate commerce, has been so recently and repeatedly decided in this court as to require now little more than a reference to some of the cases.

We regard these cases as settling the proposition that the shipper as well as the carrier is bound to take notice of the filed tariff rates, and that so long as they remain operative they are conclusive as to the rights of the parties, in the absence of facts or circumstances showing an attempt at rebating or false billing. Great Northern R. Co. v. O'Connor, supra. To give to the oral agreement upon which the suit was brought, the prevailing \n\n[233 U.S. 173, 181]\n\u00a0\n effect allowed in this case by the charge in the trial court, affirmed by the judgment of the supreme court of the state, would be to allow a special contract to have binding force and effect though made in violation of the filed schedules which were to be equally observed by the shipper and carrier. If oral agreements of this character can be sustained, then the door is open to all manner of special contracts, departing from the schedules and rates filed with the Commission, Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, \n227 U.S. 652\n, 57 L. ed. 688, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 391. To maintain the supremacy of such oral agreements would defeat the primary purposes of the interstate commerce act, so often affirmed in the decisions of this court, which are to require equal treatment of all shippers and the charging of but one rate to all, and that the one filed as required by the act.\n The supreme court of the state in this case affirmed the instruction of the trial court upon which the case was given to the jury, and held that the oral contract was binding unless it was affirmatively shown that the written agreement, based upon the filed schedules, was brought to the knowledge of the shipper, and its terms assented to by him. This ruling ignored the terms of shipment set forth in the schedules and permitted recovery upon the contract made in violation thereof in a case where there was no proof that there was an attempt to violate the published rates by a fraudulent agreement showing rebating or false billing of the property, and no circumstances which would take the case out of the rulings heretofore made by this court as to the binding effect of such filed schedules and the duty of the shipper to take notice of the terms of such rates, and the obligation to be bound thereby, in the absence of the exceptional circumstances to which we have referred.\n It follows that the ruling of the state court, affirmed in the Supreme Court, deprived the plaintiff in error of rights secured by the Federal statute, when properly \n\n[233 U.S. 173, 182]\n\u00a0\n construed, which were set up and claimed in the state court.\n Judgment reversed and case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice Pitney dissents. \n\n\n\n","6":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATCHISON, T. & S.

There was a verdict and judgment for the defendants in error, which was affirmed by the supreme court of Oklahoma (36 Okla. 433, 129 Pac. 24).\n It appears that the horse, for the injury to which this suit was brought, was a part of the shipment under which the horse in the previous case of Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Robinson, just decided [\n233 U.S. 173\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct.

The supreme court of Oklahoma, after noticing the fact that, except as to the value of the animals, the extent of their injuries and the resulting damages, the two cases were identical in every material feature, followed the Robinson Case.\n The present case, therefore, is controlled by the decision in the Robinson Case, and from what we have there said it follows that the judgment here under review must be reversed.\n Judgment reversed and case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice Pitney dissents. \n\n\n\n","7":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATLANTIC COAST LINE R.

Allen for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company, plaintiff in error, has succeeded to the ownership of the property, franchises, and rights of the Wilmington & Raleigh Railroad Company, which was chartered by the general assembly of North Carolina in the year 1833, and whose name was \n\n[232 U.S. 548, 551]\n\u00a0\n afterwards changed to Wilmington & Weldon Railroad Company. Under its charter powers the original company constructed its railroad from Wilmington to and into Wayne county, North Carolina, passing through the place which later, and in the year 1847, became incorporated as the town of Goldsboro, now the city of Goldsboro, defendant in error.\n For the purposes of its railroad, the Wilmington & Raleigh Company acquired a strip of land 130 feet wide, extending through Goldsboro from north to south, and constructed its road upon it before the incorporation of the town. The land was acquired in part under deeds conveying title in fee simple, in part by condemnation proceedings which conferred upon the company, as is claimed, the equivalent of a fee simple. Afterwards, two other companies, designated respectively as the North Carolina Railroad Company and the Atlantic & North Carolina Railroad Company, with the consent and permission of the Wilmington & Raleigh, or Wilmington & Weldon, and under agreements with that company, constructed their railroad tracks upon the same 'right of way.'\n The town naturally grew along the railroad, and the right of way, so far as not occupied by the tracks, was and still is used for the ordinary purposes of a street, without objection by plaintiff in error or its predecessors in title. In laying out the town, this right of way was designated as a street 130 feet wide; the portion lying east of the tracks being designated as East Center street, the portion on the west of the tracks as West Center street. Cross streets were laid out, designated successively (commencing at the north) as Holly, Beech, Vine, Oak, Ash, Mulberry, Walnut, Chestnut, Spruce, Pine, and Elm streets. East and West Center streets have become the principal business streets of the town and the portion between Ash and Spruce-four blocks-is the heart of the city. \n\n[232 U.S. 548, 552]\n\u00a0\n During the years since the incorporation of Goldsboro numerous industries have been and are now located on East and West Center streets, and the track of plaintiff in error, in addition to its use as a part of the main line, has been and is used by the company in shifting cars into and out of these industries, and also for reaching the freight terminals of the other two railroads, which are in the northerly part of the town; the terminal of plaintiff in error being in the southerly part. A belt line has been built around the city, over which through passenger trains and some freight trains are moved, but the use of the old main line for connecting with the other terminals, for shifting cars into industries, and loading tracks along the right of way, and for the passage of certain of its trains, is claimed by plaintiff in error to be still essential to its business.\n The municipal corporation has for many years worked and maintained its streets and cross streets, including so much of the surface of East and West Center streets as lies outside of the space actually occupied by the railroad tracks. More recently it has instituted a system of street grades and of drainage extending throughout the city, and has paved a considerable part of East and West Center streets in conformity to the grade so established. From Chestnut street north the railroad tracks are ( or, at least, prior to the municipal action complained of they were) from 6 to 18 inches above the established street grade; the tracks south of Chestnut street being in a cut from 1 to 8 feet deep.\n In November, 1909, the board of aldermen passed an ordinance or ordinances containing the following provisions: Section 1 rendered it unlawful for any railroad company to run any freight or passenger train on East or West Center streets at a rate of speed exceeding 4 miles per hour, and required the companies to have flagmen proceed 50 feet in front of every train to warn persons of its approach. Section 2 provided that the shifting \n\n[232 U.S. 548, 553]\n\u00a0\n limits on East and West Center streets should be from Spruce street to the city limits on the south, and from Ash street to the city limits on the north; thus excluding the four blocks between Spruce and Ash streets. Section 3 declared it to be unlawful for any railroad company to do any shifting within those four blocks at any other time than between the hours of 6:30 and 8:30 A. M., and between 4:30 and 6:30 P. M. Section 4 rendered it unlawful for any railroad company to place any car and allow it to stand for a longer period than five minutes at any point on East and West Center streets within the same four blocks. Section 5 required all railroad companies owning tracks on East and West Center streets between Walnut and Vine (four blocks) to lower the tracks so as to make them conform to the grade line of the streets, and to fill in the tracks between the rails; the required lowering being specified as 6 inches from Walnut to Mulberry, 10 inches between Mulberry and Ash, and 18 inches between Ash and Vine streets. Substantial penalties were prescribed for violations of these prohibitions.\n Plaintiff in error began this action against the city of Goldsboro in the superior court of Wayne county, seeking to restrain the enforcement of the ordinances. A temporary restraining order was granted. At the hearing, the objection to the enforcement of  1 was abandoned by plaintiff; as to the other sections the court vacated the restraining order. Upon appeal, the supreme court of North Carolina affirmed the judgment. 155 N. C. 356, 71 S. E. 514. The present writ of error under  709, Rev. Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575 (Judicial Code,  237 [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 227]), is based upon the insistence, made in the state courts and there overruled, that the ordinances impair the obligation of the contract contained in the charter of the company, in contravention of  10 of art. 1, of the Federal Constitution, and deprive the company of its property without due process of law, in contravention of the 14th Amendment. \n\n[232 U.S. 548, 554]\n\u00a0\n The supreme court of the state construed the section forbidding shifting as having reference to the 'cutting out and putting in' of cars in the making up of a train before it is despatched upon its journey, and not as referring to the 'transfer' of a train of cars, already made up by plaintiff in error, to another railroad company for transportation. In view of the fact that plaintiff in error has shifting yards farther from the center of the city, where its trains can be made up and at least the chief part of the necessary shifting done, the court held it to be a reasonable exercise of the police power to forbid car shifting, except within the limited hours specified, on the four blocks of the plaintiff's track that lie in the heart of the city; declaring this regulation to be necessary for the convenience and safety of the public at the crossings.\n With reference to the section requiring the lowering of the tracks between Walnut and Vine streets so as to make them conform to the grade lines of the streets, the court held that the Company took its charter subject to the right of the state to lay out new roads and streets, and to require the company to make such alterations as would prevent the public passage over its tracks from being impeded; and that there was no contract exempting the railroad from changing its grade at crossings when required.\n In this court, plaintiff in error abandons its attack upon the right of the city to require a change of grade at the street crossings. The controversy, therefore, is now limited to (a) the restrictions imposed by  2 and 3 upon shifting operations on East and West Center streets between Spruce and Ash streets; (b) the prohibition of  4 against the standing of cars for a longer period than five minutes within the same four blocks; and (c) the requirement under  5 that the tracks from Walnut to Vine streets shall conform to the grade of East and West Center streets, and shall be filled in between the rails, elsewhere \n\n[232 U.S. 548, 555]\n\u00a0\n than at the crossing streets. Upon the argument, it was stated by counsel representing the city that plaintiff in error had complied with the decision of the state court as to  5, at least, to the extent of lowering its tracks. But there was no clear admission of the fact in behalf of plaintiff in error, and we shall therefore disregard the supposed compliance.\n It is, among other things, contended by plaintiff in error that the ordinances are not within the powers conferred by the legislature of North Carolina upon the municipal corporation. This is a question of state law, which, for present purposes, is conclusively settled by the decision of the supreme court of North Carolina in this case. Merchants' & M. Nat. Bank v. Pennsylvania, \n167 \nU.S. 461, 462\n, 42 S. L. ed. 236, 237, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 829, and cases cited; Lombard v. West Chicago Park Comrs. \n181 \nU.S. 33, 43\n, 45 S. L. ed. 731, 737, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 507.\n A municipal by-law or ordinance, enacted by virtue of power for that purpose delegated by the legislature of the state, is a state law within the meaning of the Federal Constitution. New Orleans Waterworks Co. v. Louisiana Sugar Ref. Co. \n125 \nU.S. 18, 31\n, 31 S. L. ed. 607, 612, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 741; Hamilton Gaslight & Coke Co. v. Hamilton, \n146 \nU.S. 258, 266\n, 36 S.

Rep. 220.\n And any enactment, from whatever source originating, to which a state gives the force of law, is a statute of the state, within the meaning of the pertinent clause of  709, Rev. Stat., Judicial Code,  237; which confers jurisdiction on this court. Williams v. Bruffy, \n96 \nU.S. 176, 183\n, 24 S. L. ed. 716, 717.\n We must therefore treat the ordinances as legislation enacted by virtue of the lawmaking power of the state. They are manifestly an exertion of the police power, and the question is whether, viewed in that light, they run counter to the 'contract' or 'due process' clauses. \n\n[232 U.S. 548, 556]\n\u00a0\n That a railroad charter may embody a contract, within the meaning of the Constitution, hardly needs to be stated. Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 4 L. ed. 629. In the present case the supreme court of North Carolina held that by the Constitution of the state, the charter was subject to alteration or repeal at the legislative will. If the right of repeal was indeed thus reserved, the result is obvious. Greenwood v. Union Freight R. Co. \n105 \nU.S. 13, 21\n, 26 S. L. ed. 961, 965; Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville, \n189 \nU.S. 434, 437\n, 47 S. L. ed. 887, 891, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 531. But when this court has under review the judgment of a state court by virtue of  709, Rev-Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575, and the validity of a state law is challenged on the ground that it impairs the obligation of a contract, this court must determine for itself the existence or nonexistence of the asserted contract, and whether its obligation has been impaired. Douglas v. Kentucky, \n168 \nU.S. 488, 502\n, 42 S. L. ed. 553, 557, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 199; Stearns v. Minnesota, \n179 \nU.S. 223, 233\n, 45 S. L. ed. 162, 170, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 73. We are not referred to and are unable to find, in the state Constitution as it existed when the charter now in question was granted, any reservation of the right of repeal, and will assume for present purposes that the contract was not thus qualified, and deal only with the question whether it has been impaired.\n Plaintiff in error lays more particular stress upon the insistence that its property rights in the street will be infringed by the enforcement of the ordinances. Because its predecessors acquired the strip of land in fee simple, and because the municipal corporation has never condemned it or made compensation for its use as a street, the contention is that the title of the railroad company remains until now, absolute and unqualified. Reference is made to Rev. Code (N. C.) chap. 65,  23. This section, it seems, became law in North Carolina in the year 1854, and has remained upon the statute books continuously until the present time, appearing now as  388 of the Revisal of 1908; see also Code 1883,  150. It provides that 'no railroad, plank road, turnpike, or canal company \n\n[232 U.S. 548, 557]\n\u00a0\n shall be barred of, or presumed to have conveyed, any real estate, right of way, easement, leasehold, or other interest in the soil which may have been condemned, or otherwise obtained for its use, as a right of way, depot, station house or place of landing, by any statute of limitation, or by occupation of the same by any person whatever.' Two cases, Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Olive, 142 N. C. 257, 271, 55 S. E. 263, and Muse v. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. 149 N. C. 443, 446, 19 L.R.A.(N.S.) 453, 63 S. E. 102, are cited as supporting the proposition that under this statute a permissive user of any portion of the railroad right of way by others, or even by the public as a street, cannot impair the title of the company unless at least there be adverse user or possession for a sufficient period to satisfy the statutes on that subject; and it is insisted there has been none. But in both cases the question was as to the effect of the permissive user or possession upon merely private rights, and in the Muse Case it was expressly conceded (149 N. C. 446) that the rights of the railroad company in that portion of its right of way that had been used as a street were subject to the police power of the town. In the present case, likewise, the state court (155 N. C. 363) treated the question of the ownership of the soil as not involved in the decision.\n And we are not at present particularly concerned with either contract or property rights, except as they may serve to show the conditions under which the ordinances were adopted, and may bear upon the question of the reasonableness of those regulations. These have to do with the use and control of the property, rather than with its ownership; with the mode in which the franchise shall be enjoyed, rather than with its scope. Conceding, for argument's sake only, the utmost that may be claimed as to the charter and property rights of plaintiff in error, we still have yielded nothing that may defeat the exercise of the police power by the state, or by its authorized agency. Adopting the extreme assumption that the railroad \n\n[232 U.S. 548, 558]\n\u00a0\n company has still a complete and unqualified ownership of every portion of the strip of land that was originally acquired in fee simple, and as proprietor might lawfully exercise its dominion by excluding the public from it; yet it does not do this, but permits, and long has permitted, the public to use material portions of the strip for ordinary street purposes; it apparently excludes the public from no portion except as the existence of the tracks and the passage of trains may have such a tendency or effect. And thus the company, at least for the time, devotes its property in part to public uses that are more or less inconsistent with the railroad uses, and under conditions such as to render the railroad operations necessarily a source of danger to the public while enjoying the permitted use. Under such circumstances the state, in the exercise of the police power, may legitimately extend the application of the principle that underlies the maxim, Sic utere tuo ut alienum non loedas, so far as may be requisite for the protection of the public.\n For it is settled that neither the 'contract' clause nor the 'due process' clause has the effect of overriding the power of the state to establish all regulations that are reasonably necessary to secure the health, safety, good order, comfort, or general welfare of the community; that this power can neither be abdicated nor bargained away, and is inalienable even by express grant; and that all contract and property rights are held subject to its fair exercise.

And the enforcement of uncompensated obedience to a regulation established under this power for the public health or safety is not an unconstitutional taking of property without compensation or without \n\n[232 U.S. 548, 559]\n\u00a0\n due process of law.

Cas. 1175\n\n\n Of course, if it appear that the regulation under criticism is not in any way designed to promote the health, comfort, safety, or welfare of the community, or that the means employed have no real and substantial relation to the avowed or ostensible purpose, or that there is wanton or arbitrary interference with private rights, the question arises whether the law-making body has exceeded the legitimate bounds of the police power.\n The ordinances now in question must be considered in view not only of the charter and property rights of plaintiff in error, but of the actual situation that has developed and now exists in Goldsboro, with the consent and long acquiescence of plaintiff in error and its predecessors in interest. A town of considerable size and importance has grown up along the line of the railroad. The strip of land 130 feet in width, so far as it is not occupied by the railroad tracks, for many years has been and still is used for the ordinary purposes of a street. The supreme court of North Carolina found, upon adequate evidence, that it is the main business street of the town, frequently crowded with pedestrians and vehicles; and that the operation of trains along it, notwithstanding the utmost care of the railroad company, tends to obstruct the crossings and is fraught with danger to life and property. There are, within the blocks covered by the ordinances, two main lines of railway besides that of plaintiff in error. These, of course, complicate the situation by narrowing the spaces available for ordinary travel north and south on East and West Center streets, and must also enhance the dangers at the crossings.\n It is very properly conceded that the company may be required to limit the speed of its trains, and to have flag- \n\n[232 U.S. 548, 560]\n\u00a0\n men precede them to warn persons of their approach; and that the company may be required to change its grade at the street crossings. In New York & N. E. R. Co. v. Bristol, \n151 \nU.S. 556, 567\n, 38 S. L. ed. 269, 272, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 437, this court sustained a Connecticut statute directed to the extinction of grade crossings as a menace to public safety, and compelling this to be done at the expense of the companies, although the grade crossings had been long before established under legislative authority. In Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 251\n, 41 S. L. ed. 979, 989, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581, it was held that when the city opened a new street across the railroad it was not bound to take and pay for the fee in the land, but only to make compensation to the extent that the value of the company's right to use the land for railroad purposes was diminished by opening the street across it; and that the company was not entitled to have its compensation increased because of the fact that in order to safeguard the crossing it would thereafter be obliged to construct gates, and a tower for operating them, plank the crossing, fill in between the rails, and incur certain annual expenses for depreciation, maintenance, employment of gatemen, etc. To the same effect are Wabash R. Co. v. Defiance, \n167 \nU.S. 88, 97\n, 42 S. L. ed. 87, 91, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 748; Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Nebraska, \n170 \nU.S. 57, 75\n, 42 S. L. ed. 948, 954, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 513; Northern P. R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n208 \nU.S. 583, 597\n, 52 S. L. ed. 630, 636, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 341; Cincinnati, I. & W. R. Co. v. Connersville, \n218 \nU.S. 336, 343\n, 54 S. L. ed. 1060, 1064, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 93, 20 Ann. Cas. 1206; Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Minneapolis, decided this day [\n232 U.S. 430\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 400]. And see Grand Trunk Western R. Co. v. South Bend, \n227 \nU.S. 544, 554\n, 57 S. L. ed. 633, 639, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 405, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 303.\n But manifestly the tracks cannot be brought to the street grade at the crossings without being lowered between the crossings as well. And if this is to be done, it follows that not merely the tracks, but the surface adjacent to the tracks, must be made to conform to the established grade of East and West Center streets between the crossing streets; or else the street will be rendered materially less convenient for purposes of north- and-south travel, \n\n[232 U.S. 548, 561]\n\u00a0\n and the drainage will be materially interfered with; or at least the municipal authorities might reasonably so determine. The establishment of a proper system of drainage for the city in the interest of the public health and general welfare is an object that legitimately invokes the exercise of the police power. New Orleans Gas Light Co. v. Drainage Commission, \n197 \nU.S. 453, 460\n, 49 S. L. ed. 831, 834, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 471.\n As to filling in between the rails, elsewhere than at the crossing streets, we have to do not merely with the necessities of drainage, but with the safety of persons crossing the railroad tracks midway of the respective street blocks. The power of the state to prescribe precautions with respect to the running of railroad trains so as to guard against injuries to the persons or property of others is not confined to the establishment of such precautions at highway crossings. State enactments requiring railroad corporations to maintain fences and cattle guards alongside the railroad have been repeatedly sustained. Missouri P. R. Co. v. Humes, \n115 \nU.S. 512, 522\n, 29 S. L. ed. 463, 466, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 110; Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. v. Beckwith, \n129 \nU.S. 26, 34\n, 32 S. L. ed. 585, 588, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 207; Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. v. Emmons, \n149 \nU.S. 364, 366\n, 37 S. L. ed. 769, 771, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 870. For the purposes of the argument it may be conceded that no person has the right, as against the railroad company, to pass over its tracks except at one of the street intersections; although this may not be entirely clear. But unless excluding fences be established adjacent to the railroad tracks (and this is not proposed nor even suggested as feasible), it is inevitable that many people, with or without right (children of tender years, among others ), will cross at places other than the street intersections; and a police regulation intended to prevent injuries to persons thus crossing cannot be judicially denounced as arbitrary. Other grounds for sustaining  5 might be mentioned; but we need not further particularize.\n There remain only the limitation of car shifting and the prohibition of the standing of cars upon East and West \n\n[232 U.S. 548, 562]\n\u00a0\n Center streets in the four blocks that lie between Spruce and Ash streets, in the heart of the city. As already pointed out, the state court construed 'shifting' as applying only to the 'cutting out and putting in' of cars in the making up of trains. This operation is not to be performed within the four blocks specified except during two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon of each day. The time limits were evidently adopted with regard to the necessities of the industries that are located along the railroad, and at the same time with a view to the necessities of general travel upon the streets. It was complained that the time allowed for shifting is inadequate; but there is nothing in the proof on this subject to overthrow the finding of the court that the ordinance is a reasonable exercise of the police power.\n The prohibition against the standing of cars for a longer period than five minutes within the same four blocks is intended to prevent the loading and unloading of cars in the street, with the attendant use of wagons and drays for the purpose. In view of the obstruction to street travel that is naturally incident to such operations, the prohibition cannot be deemed wholly unreasonable. In effect it prevents ordinary travel upon the street from being thus obstructed, and requires that the loading and unloading of cars shall be done at the regular freight terminals.\n The regulations in question are thus found to be fairly designed to promote the public health, safety, and welfare; the measures adopted appear to be reasonably suited to the purposes they are intended to accomplish; and we are unable to say that there is any unnecessary interference with the operations of the railroad, or with the property rights of plaintiff in error. Therefore, no violation of the 'contract' or 'due process' clauses is shown.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATLANTIC COAST LINE R. CO. v. STATE OF GEORGIA(1914)\nNo. 24\nArgued: April 17, 1913Decided: June 8, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 280, 281]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry L. Stone, Alfred P. Thom, Alexander Hamilton, and Robert C. Alston for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 280, 284]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomas S. felder, Attorney General of Georgia, for defendant in error.\n\n\n[234 U.S. 280, 286]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company, the plaintiff in error, was convicted of violating a statute of the state of Georgia known as the 'headlight law.' Pub. Laws (Ga.) 1908, pp. 50, 51; Civil Code,  2697, 2698. In defense is was insisted that the act contravened the commerce clause and the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. On appeal from the judgment of conviction, the court of appeals of the state of Georgia certified the questions thus raised, together with others involving the application of the state Constitution, to the supreme court of the state. Answering these questions, that court sustained the validity of the statute (135 Ga. 545, 32 L.R.A.(N.S.) 20, 69 S. E. 725), whereupon final judgment was entered and this writ of error was sued out.\n The material portions of the statute are as follows: \n\n[234 U.S. 280, 287]\n\u00a0\n 'Section 1. Be it enacted by the general assembly of Georgia, and it is hereby enacted by authority of the same, that all railroad companies are hereby required to equip and maintain each and every locomotive used by such company to run on its main line after dark with a good and sufficient headlight, which shall consume not less than 300 watts at the arc, and with a reflector not less than 23 inches in diameter, and to keep the same in good condition. The word main line as used herein means all portions of the railway line, not used solely as yards, spurs, and side tracks.\n'Section 2. Be it further enacted that any railroad company violating this act in any respect shall be liable to indictment as for a misdemeanor in any county in which the locomotive not so equipped and maintained may run, and on conviction shall be punished by fine as prescribed in  1039 of the Code of 1895. . . .\n\n'Section 4. Provided this act shall not apply to tram roads, mill roads, and roads engaged principally in lumber or logging transportation in connection with mills.'\n\n The contention is made that this act deprives the company of its liberty of comtract, and of its property without due process of law. It compels the disuse of a material part of the company's present equipment, and the substitution of a new appliance. The use of locomotive headlights, however, is directly related to safety in operation. It cannot be denied that the protective power of government, subject to which the carrier conducts its business and manages its property, extends as well to the regulation of this part of the carrier's equipment as to apparatus for heating cars or to automatic couplers. The legislature may require an adequate headlight and whether the carrier's practice is properly conducive to safety, or a new method affording greater protection should be substituted, is a matter for the legislative judgment. But it is insisted that the legislature has gone beyond the \n\n[234 U.S. 280, 288]\n\u00a0\n limits of its authority in making the specific requirements contained in the act as to the character and power of the light and the dimensions of the reflector. This argument ignores the established principle that if its action is not arbitrary,-is reasonably related to a proper purpose,-the legislature may select the means which it deems to be appropriate to the end to be achieved. It is not bound to content itself with general directions when it considers that more detailed measures are necessary to attain a legitimate object. Particularization has had many familiar illustrations in cases where there has been a conviction of the need of it; as, for example, in building regulations and in provisions for safeguarding persons in the use of dangerous machinery. So far as governmental power is concerned, we know of no ground for an exception in the case of a locomotive headlight.\n It cannot be said that the legislature acted arbitrarily in prescribing electric light, in preference to others, or that, having made this selection, it was not entitled to impose minimum requirements to be observed in the use of the light. Witnesses for the plaintiff in error, including its general superintendent of motive power and other employees holding important positions and conversant with the exigencies of operation, presented their objections to the use of the electric headlight. Locomotive engineers who, for many years, had driven locomotives with such a light, testified for the state, expressing a decided opinion in favor of the use of electric headlights in the interest of safe operation, and submitting their views in answer to the objections that had been urged. Assuming that there is room for differences of opinion, this fact does not preclude the exercise of the legislative discretion. So far as the question was one simply of expediency,-as to the best method to provide the desired security,-it was within the competency of the legislature to decide it. New York & N. E. R. Co. v. Bristol, \n151 \nU.S. 556, 571\n, 38 S. L. ed. 269, 274, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 437; Chicago, B. & Q. \n\n[234 U.S. 280, 289]\n\u00a0\n R. Co. v.

Rep. 259, and cases there cited.\n As to the objection that the statute makes no provision for conditions beyond the carrier's control, it is sufficient to say that in the light of the construction placed upon the act by the supreme court of the state, we are not at liberty to regard it as open to this criticism ( 135 Ga. pp. 561, 562); certainly, no such case is here presented. We conclude that there is no valid objection to the statute upon the ground that it deprives the carrier of liberty or property without due process of law.\n The further contention is that the statute offends in denying to the plaintiff in error the equal protection of the laws. Specifically, the complaint is that the act does not apply to receivers operating railroads, and that it expressly excepts tram roads, mill roads, and roads engaged principally in lumber or logging transportation in connection with mills. As to the first, it cannot be said that the act does exclude receivers from its requirements. The state court has ruled that the words 'railroad company' in the statute include natural persons as well as corporations. It declined to decide that receivers were not included; but, conceding, without deciding, that they were not, it was held that the statute would not for that reason violate the equal protection clause in view of the temporary and special character of receivers' management. 135 Ga. pp. 555, 556. We concur in this view. As to the exceptions made by the statute of tram roads, mill roads, etc., it is impossible to say that the differences with respect to operation and traffic conditions did not present a reasonable basis for classification. Lindsley v. National Carbonic Gas Co. \n220 \nU.S. 61, 78\n, 81 S., 55 L. ed. 369, 377, 378, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160; Barrett v. Indiana, \n229 \nU.S. 26, 30\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1050, 1052, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 692; German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Kansas, \n233 \nU.S. 389, 418\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 612. \n\n[234 U.S. 280, 290]\n\u00a0\n Finally, it is urged that the statute constitutes an unwarrantable interference with interstate commerce. The locomotive with respect to which the accusation was made was at the time being regularly used in the hauling of interstate freight trains over the company's main line of railroad, and was equipped with an oil headlight. The statute, as the supreme court of the state said, was not directed against interstate commerce, but it was held that it incidentally applied to locomotives used in hauling interstate trains while these were moving on the main line in the state of Georgia. This being so, the act is said to be repugnant to the exclusive power of Congress. It is argued that if Georgia may prescribe an electric headlight, other states through which the road runs may require headlights of a different sort; that, for example, some may demand the use of acetylene, and that others may require oil; and that, if state requirements conflict, it will be necessary to carry additional apparatus and to make various adjustments at state lines, which would delay and inconvenience interstate traffic.\n The argument is substantially the same as that which was strongly presented to the court in New York, N. H. & H. R. Co. v. New York, \n165 U.S. 628\n, 41 L. ed. 853, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 418, where the plaintiff in error was held subject to penalty for the violation of a New York statute which in substance made it unlawful for any steam railroad doing business in that state to heat its passenger cars, on any other than mixed trains, by any stove or furnace kept inside of the car or suspended therefrom. The railroad company was a Connecticut corporation having but a few miles of road within the state of New York, and operating through trains from New York through Connecticut to Massachusetts. As this court said in its opinion, the argument was made that 'a conflict between state regulations in respect of the heating of passenger cars used in interstate commerce would make safe and rapid \n\n[234 U.S. 280, 291]\n\u00a0\n TRANSPORTATION IMPOSSIBLE; THAT TO STOP An express train on its trip from new York to Boston at the Connecticut line in order that passengers may leave the cars heated as required by New York, and get into other cars heated in a different mode, in conformity with the laws of Connecticut, and then at the Massachusetts line to get into cars heated by still another mode, as required by the laws of that commonwealth, would be a hardship on travel that could not be endured.' But the court ruled that these 'possible inconveniences' could not affect 'the question of power in each state to make such reasonable regulations for the safety of passengers on interstate trains as, in its judgment, all things considered, is appropriate and effective.' Supra, pp. 632, 633.\n In thus deciding, the court applied the settled principle that, in the absence of legislation by Congress, the states are not denied the exercise of their power to secure safety in the physical operation of railroad trains within their territory, even though such trains are used in interstate commerce. That has been the law since the beginning of railroad transportation. It was not intended that, pending Federal action, the use of such agencies, which, unless carefully guarded, was fraught with danger to the community, should go unregulated, and that the states should be without authority to secure needed local protection. The requirements of a state, of course, must not be arbitrary, or pass beyond the limits of a fair judgment as to what the exigency demands, but they are not invalid because another state, in the exercise of a similar power, may not impose the same regulation. We may repeat what was said in Smith v. Alabama, \n124 \nU.S. 465, 481\n, 482 S., 31 L. ed. 508, 513, 514, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 804, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 564: 'It is to be remembered that railroads are not natural highways of trade and commerce. . . . The places where they may be located, and the plans according to which they must be constructed, are prescribed by the legislation of the state. Their operation requires the use of instruments \n\n[234 U.S. 280, 292]\n\u00a0\n and agencies attended with special risks and dangers, the proper management of which involves peculiar knowledge, training, skill, and care. The safety of the public in person and property demands the use of specific guards and precautions. . . . The rules prescribed for their construction and for their management and operation, designed to protect persons and property, otherwise endangered by their use, are strictly within the limits of the local law. They are not per se regulations of commerce; it is only when they operate as such in the circumstances of their application, and conflict with the expressed or presumed will of Congress exerted on the same subject, that they can be required to give way to the supreme authority of the Constitution.' See also Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Alabama, \n128 U.S. 96\n, 32 L. ed. 352, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 238, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 28; Hennington v. Georgia, \n163 U.S. 299\n, 41 L. ed. 166, 16 Sup. Ct.

Ct. Rep. 729.\n If there is a conflict in such local regulations, by which interstate commerce may be inconvenienced,-if there appears to be need of standardization of safety appliances, and of providing rules of operation which will govern the entire interstate road, irrespective of state boundaries,-there is a simple remedy; and it cannot be assumed that it will not be readily applied if there be real occasion for it. That remedy does not rest in a denial to the state, in the absence of conflicting Federal action, of its power to protect life and property within its borders, but it does lie in the exercise of the paramount authority of Congress, in its control of interstate commerce, to establish such regulations as, in its judgment, may be deemed appropriate and sufficient. Congress, when it pleases, may give the rule and make the standard to be observed on the interstate highway. \n\n[234 U.S. 280, 293]\n\u00a0\n It is suggested that Congress has acted in the present instance. Reference is made to the act of March 2, 1893, chap. 196 (27 Stat. at L. 531, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3174), relating to power driving-wheel brakes for locomotives, grab irons, automatic couplers, and height of drawbars; to the act of March 2, 1903, chap. 976 (32 Stat. at L. 943, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1314), amending the act of 1893; to the act of May 27, 1908, chap. 200 (35 Stat. at L. 324, 325, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1325) authorizing the Interstate Commerce Commission to keep informed regarding compliance with the safety-appliance act, and to investigate and report on the need of any appliances or systems intended to promote the safety of railway operations; to the act of May 30, 1908, chap. 225 (35 Stat. at L. 476, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1326), relating to locomotive ash pans; to the act of April 14, 1910, chap. 160 ( 36 Stat. at L. 298, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1327), relating to sill steps, hand brakes, ladders, running boards, and hand holds, and providing that the Interstate Commerce Commission should, after hearing, designate the number, dimensions, location, and manner of application of these appliances, and of those required by the act of 1893; to the detailed regulations prescribed by the Commission, on March 13, 1911, pursuant to this authority; to the act of May 6, 1910, chap. 208 (36 Stat. at L. 350, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1329), requiring the Commission to investigate accidents and make report as to their causes, with such recommendations as they may deem proper; and to the act of February 17, 1911, chap. 103 (36 Stat. at L. 913, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1333), relating to locomotive boilers.\n But it is manifest that none of these acts provides regulations for locomotive headlights. Attention is also called to the investigations conducted by what is known as the 'block signal and train control board' ( organized by the Commission), and the reports of that board with respect to sundry devices and appliances, including headlights. It does not appear, however, either that Congress has acted, or that the Commission, under the authority of Congress, has established any regulation so far as headlights are concerned. As to these, the situation has not been altered by any exertion of Federal power, and the \n\n[234 U.S. 280, 294]\n\u00a0\n case stands as it has always stood, without regulation, unless it be supplied by local authority. The most that can be said is that inquiries have been made, but that Congress has not yet decided to establish regulations, either directly or through its subordinate body, as to the applicance in question. The intent to supersede the exercise of the state's police power with respect to this subject cannot be inferred from the restricted action which thus far has been taken. Missouri P. R. Co. v.

IMBROVEK(1914)\nNo. 215\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 52, 53]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.\n Edward Duffy, Nicholas P. Bond, and Ralph Robinson for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 52, 54]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.\n W. H. Price, Jr., John E. Semmes, John E. Semmes, Jr., Jesse N. Bowen, and Matthew Gault for respondent.\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 52, 56]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a libel to recover for personal injuries sustained by the libellant as a stevedore in the employ of the Atlantic Transport Company ( the petitioner), which was engaged in loading the Pretoria, belonging to the Hamburg-American Steam Packet Company, while lying in the port \n\n[234 U.S. 52, 57]\n\u00a0\n of Baltimore. The libel was brought against both the owner of the ship and the stevedore company. It was dismissed as to the former, but a recovery against the latter was allowed by the district court (190 Fed. 229) and sustained by the circuit court of appeals (113 C. C. A. 398, 193 Fed. 1019 ). This writ of certiorari was granted.\n The libellant was one of a gang engaged in loading and stowing copper. He was working on the ship, under one of the hatches. The covers of the hatch were in three sections, the division being made by two movable iron beams placed athwart the ship. The coverings of the middle section had been removed and placed on top of the fore and after sections. On the dock, the copper was piled upon a rope mat which was lifted by a winch, swung over the hatch, and lowered into the hold. On one of its return trips the mat caught under the after cross beam, which was instantly jerked out of its support, and, with the lengthwise timbers resting on it and the hatch covers, fell into the hold, severely injuring the libellant. The district court (referring to the petitioner, the Atlantic Transport Company, as the stevedore) said: 'There would have been no accident had the entire hatch been uncovered. To uncover a hatch takes time and labor. If bad weather comes, it must be covered. Unnecessary uncovering is to be avoided. It is easy to make a partially covered hatch absolutely safe. The cross beams of the hatch have holes in their ends. There are corresponding holes in the hatch combings. Pins can be put through these holes. It takes about five minutes to put them in. When in place, an accident such as gave rise to this case cannot happen. The ship's carpenter of the Pretoria keeps the pins when not in use. Accidents often happen because an opened hatch has been left unguarded, or because the hatch coverings fall into the hold. When they do there is usually a dispute as to whether the ship or the stevedore is to blame. In the case at bar the ship and the stevedore were repre- \n\n[234 U.S. 52, 58]\n\u00a0\n sented by the same proctors and by the same advocates. The stevedore acquits the ship. . . . The stevedore proved that, when the ship came into port, it took complete charge of the hatches. It uncovered so much of them as it saw fit. If the pins were in and it wanted them out, it took them out. It laid them on the deck. The ship's carpenter gathered them up. If the pins were out and it wanted them in, it told the ship's carpenter. He put them in.' For its failure to use due diligence in seeing that the libellant had a safe place in which to work, the district court held the Transport Company liable.\n The principal question is whether the district court had jurisdiction; that is, whether the cause was one 'of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.' Const. Art. 3,  2; Rev. Stat.  563, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 455; Judicial Code,  24 [36 Stat. at L. 1091, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 135], act of Sept. 24, 1789, chap. 20,  9, 1 Stat. at L. 73, 77. As the injury occurred on board a ship while it was lying in navigable waters, there is no doubt that the requirement as to locality was fully met. The petitioner insists, however, that locality is not the sole test, and that it must appear that the tort was otherwise of a maritime nature. And this was the view taken by the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit, in affirming a decree dismissing a libel for want of jurisdiction in a similar case. Campbell v. H. Hackfeld & Co. 62 C. C. A. 274, 125 Fed. 696.\n At an early period the court of admiralty in England exercised jurisdiction 'over torts, injuries, and offenses at ports within the ebb and flow of the tide, on the British seas and on the high seas.' De Lovio v. Boit, 2 Gall. 398, 406, 464, 474, Fed. Cas. No. 3,776. While its authority was denied when the injurious action took place infra corpus comitatus, it was not disputed that jurisdiction existed when the wrong was done 'upon the sea, or any part thereof which is not within any county.' 4 Co. Inst. 134. The jurisdiction in admiralty of the courts of the United States is not controlled by the restrictive statutes and judicial prohibitions \n\n[234 U.S. 52, 59]\n\u00a0\n of England (Waring v. Clarke, 5 How. 441, 457, 458, 12 L. ed. 226, 234, 235; New England Mut. M. Ins. Co. v. Dunham, 11 Wall. 1, 24, 20 L. ed. 90, 97; The Lottawanna [Rodd v. Heartt] 21 Wall. 558, 576, 662), and the limitation with respect to torts committed within the body of any county is not applicable here. Waring v. Clarke, supra; Jackson v. The Magnolia, 20 How. 296, 15 L. ed. 909. 'In regard to torts,' said Mr. Justice Story in Thomas v. Lane, 2 Sumn. 1, 9, Fed. Cas. No. 13,902, 'I have always understood, that the jurisdiction of the admiralty is exclusively dependent upon the locality of the act. The admiralty has not, and never (I believe) deliberately claimed to have, any jurisdiction over torts, except such as are maritime torts, that is, such as are committed on the high seas, or on waters within the ebb and flow of the tide.' This rule-that locality furnishes the test-has been frequently reiterated, with the substitution (under the doctrine of The Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 12 How. 443, 13 L. ed. 1058) of navigable waters for tide waters. Thus, in the case of Philadelphia, W. & B. R. Co. v. Philadelphia & H. de G. Steam Towboat Co. 23 How. 209, 215, 16 L. ed. 433, 435, the court said: 'The jurisdiction of courts of admiralty, in matters of contract, depends upon the nature and character of the contract; but in torts, it depends entirely on locality.' Again, in the case of The Plymouth (Hough v. Western Transp. Co.) 3 Wall. 20, 18 L. ed. 125, where jurisdiction was denied upon the ground that the substance and consummation of the wrong took place on land, and not on navigable water, the court said: 'The jurisdiction of the admiralty over maritime torts does not depend upon the wrong having been committed on board the vessel, but upon its having been committed upon the high seas or other navigable waters. A trespass on board of a vessel, or by the vessel itself, above tidewater, when that was the limit of jurisdiction, was not of admiralty cognizance. The reason was, that it was not committed within the locality that gave the jurisdiction. The vessel itself was unimportant. . . . The jurisdiction of the admiralty does not depend upon the \n\n[234 U.S. 52, 60]\n\u00a0\n fact that the injury was inflicted by the vessel, but upon the locality,- the high seas or navigable waters where it occurred. Every species of tort, however occurring, and whether on board a vessel or not, if upon the high seas or navigable waters, is of admiralty cognizance.' See Manro v. Almeida, 10 Wheat. 473, 6 L. ed. 369; Waring v. Clarke, 5 How. 459, 12 L. ed. 235; New Jersey Steam Nav. Co. v. Merchants' Bank, 6 How. 344, 394, 12 L. ed. 465, 487; The Commerce (Commercial Transp.

It is also apparent that Congress, in providing for the punishment of crimes committed upon navigable waters, has regarded the locality of the offense as the basis for the exercise of its authority.

Rep. 447.\n But the petitioners urge that the general statements which we have cited, with respect to the exclusiveness of the test of locality in cases of tort, are not controlling; and that in every adjudicated case in this country in which the jurisdiction of admiralty with respect to torts has been sustained, the tort, apart from the mere place of its occur- \n\n[234 U.S. 52, 61]\n\u00a0\n rence, has been of a maritime character. It is asked whether admiralty would entertain a suit for libel or slander circulated on board a ship by one passenger against another. See Benedict, Admiralty, 4th ed.  231. The appropriate basis, it is said, of all admiralty jurisdiction, whether in contract or in tort, is the maritime nature of the transaction or event; it is suggested that the wider authority exercised in very early times in England may be due to its antedating the recognition by the common-law courts of transitory causes of action, and thus arose by virtue of necessity.\n We do not find it necessary to enter upon this broad inquiry. As this court has observed, the precise scope of admiralty jurisdiction is not a matter of 'obvious principle or of very accurate history.' The Blackheath ( United States v. Evans) \n195 \nU.S. 361, 365\n, 367 S., 49 L. ed. 236-238, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 46. And we are not now concerned with the extreme cases which are hypothetically presented. Even if it be assumed that the requirement as to locality in tort cases, while indispensable, is not necessarily exclusive, still in the present case the wrong which was the subject of the suit was, we think, of a maritime nature, and hence the district court, from any point of view, had jurisdiction. The petitioner contends that a maritime tort is one arising out of an injury to a ship, caused by the negligence of a ship or a person, or out of an injury to a person by the negligence of a ship; that there must either be an injury to a ship or an injury by the negligence of the ship, including therein the negligence of her owners or mariners; and that, as there was no negligence of the ship in the present case, the tort was not maritime. This view we deem to be altogether too narrow.\n The libellant was injured on a ship, lying in navigable waters, and while he was engaged in the performance of a maritime service. We entertain no doubt that the service in loading and stowing a ship's cargo is of this character. Upon its proper performance depend in large measure the \n\n[234 U.S. 52, 62]\n\u00a0\n safe carrying of the cargo and the safety of the ship itself; and it is a service absolutely necessary to enable the ship to discharge its maritime duty. Formerly the work was done by the ship's crew; but, owing to the exigencies of increasing commerce and the demand for rapidity and special skill, it has become a specialized service devolving upon a class 'as clearly identified with maritime affairs as are the mariners.' See The George T. Kemp, 2 Low. Dec. 482, Fed. Cas. No. 5,341; The Circassian, 1 Ben. 209, Fed. Cas. No. 2,722; Roberts v. The Windermere, 2 Fed. 722; The Canada, 7 Sawy. 173, 7 Fed. 119; The Hattie M. Bain, 20 Fed. 389; The Gilbert Knapp, 37 Fed. 209; The Main, 2 C. C. A. 569, 2 U. S. App. 349, 51 Fed. 954; Norwegian S. S. Co. v. Washington, 6 C. C. A. 313, 13 U. S. App. 459, 57 Fed. 224; The Seguranca, 58 Fed. 908; The Allerton, 93 Fed. 219; Hughes, Admiralty, 113; Benedict, Admiralty, 4th ed.  207. The libellant was injured because the care required by the law was not taken to protect him while he was doing this work. We take it to be clear that the district court, sitting in admiralty, was entitled to declare the applicable law in such a case, as it was within the power of Congress to modify that law. Waring v. Clarke, 5 How. 459, 12 L. ed. 235; The Lottawana (Rodd v. Heartt) 21 Wall. 558, 576, 22 L. ed. 654, 662. The fact that the ship was not found to be liable for the neglect is not controlling. If more is required than the locality of the wrong in order to give the court jurisdiction, the relation of the wrong to maritime service, to navigation, and to commerce on navigable waters, was quite sufficient. Even with respect to contracts where subject-matter is the exclusive test, it has been said that the true criterion is 'whether it was a maritime contract, having reference to maritime service or maritime transactions.' New England Mut. M. Ins. Co. v. Dunham, 11 Wall. 1, 26, 20 L. ed. 90, 97. The Constitution provides that the judicial power shall extend 'to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,' and the act of Congress defines the jurisdiction of the district court, with respect to civil causes, in terms of like scope. To hold that a case of a tort committed on board a ship \n\n[234 U.S. 52, 63]\n\u00a0\n in navigable waters, by one who has undertaken a maritime service, against one engaged in the performance of that service, is not embraced within the constitutional grant and the jurisdictional act, would be to establish a limitation wholly without warrant.\n The remaining question relates to the finding of negligence. It is urged that the neglect was that of a fellow servant, and hence that the petitioner was not liable. Both courts below, however, concurred in the finding that the petitioner omitted to use proper diligence to provide a safe place of work. Baltimore & O. R. Co. v. Baugh, \n149 \nU.S. 368, 386\n, 37 S. L. ed. 772, 780, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 914. As the question belongs to a class which, under the distribution of judicial power, is determinable by the circuit court of appeals in last resort, we shall not undertake to discuss it at length or to restate the evidence.

The information upon which the conviction was based charged that the accused had, in violation of  12 of act 49 of the Laws of Louisiana for 1894, illegally, as an itinerant vender or peddler, 'sold drugs, ointments, nostrums, and applications intended for the treatment of diseases and deformity.' A motion was made to quash on the following \n\n[232 U.S. 334, 335]\n\u00a0\n grounds: First, because the statnte upon which the charge was based provided for no offense; second, because if it did, the acts charged were not, generally speaking, within the statute, and especially were not embraced by its provisions because the sale of drugs or proprietary preparations put up in sealed packages with directions for use did not constitute the practice of medicine; third, because if the statute embraced, as asserted, the acts charged, it was in conflict with the state Constitution, since it permitted all persons to sell drugs, ointments, etc ., except itinerant venders; fourth, because if the statute operated as contended for, it was repugnant to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States '(a) because it prevents a citizen from pursuing a lawful vocation; (b) it denies to other citizens rights enjoyed by all others in the state, and . . . is class legislation in its effect, as it gives to the local dealer a monopoly in the sale of such drugs, etc., and deprives the itinerant vender or dealer of the privilege to sell such articles . . .' The motion to quash having been overruled, the case was submitted to the court without a jury, upon an agreed statement of facts to the following effect: 1st, 'that the defendant was an itinerant vender of drugs, nostrums,' etc., and as such had sold the articles 'intended for the treatment of diseases, as alleged in the information.' 2d, 'that the drugs so sold by the defendant as an itinerant vender were compounded and prepared by the Rawleigh Medical Company of the state of Illinois, and that said remedies, drugs, nostrums, ointments, and applications were put up in sealed packages or bottles ready for use, with printed directions on the packages or bottles, and that defendant was an itinerant vender of same in original packages and bottles, and prepared by the proprietors.' 3d, 'that all persons except itinerant venders have the right to sell said remedies; that is, patent and proprietary drugs, nostrums, ointments, and applications, intended for the cure \n\n[232 U.S. 334, 336]\n\u00a0\n of diseases.' By requests to charge which were overruled, and to which exceptions were reserved, the defenses based both upon the state and the United States Constitution, embodied in the motion to quash, were reiterated, and on conviction and sentence after an unsuccessful effort by certiorari to procure as an act of grace, a review of the case by the supreme court of the state, this writ of error was sued out.\n Messrs. Thomas D. O'Brien and John A. Barnes for plaintiff in error. \n\n[232 U.S. 334, 337]\n\u00a0\n Mr. R. G. Pleasant, Attorney General of Louisiana, and Mr. G. A. Gondran for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice White:\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n We accept the construction affixed by the court below to the statute, and upon which alone it could in reason have held that the acts charged were embraced by its provisions. We hence disregard an intimation made in the argument of the defendant in error, that the statute is susceptible of a different interpretation, and therefore that the claim of Federal right which was made below, and which was necessarily passed upon, need not be here considered. It is inconceivable that the statute should mean one thing for the purpose of determining whether the acts charged were within its terms, and should then be held to mean another, for the purpose of escaping the Federal question. Thus considering the case in its true aspect, the single issue to be decided is, Did the state have power, without violating the equal protection or due process of \n\n[232 U.S. 334, 338]\n\u00a0\n law clause of the 14th Amendment, to forbid the sale by itinerant venders of 'any drug, nostrum, ointment, or application of any kind, intended for the treatment of disease or injury,' although allowing the sale of such articles by other persons? That it did have such authority is so clearly the result of a previous ruling of this court (Emert v. Missouri, \n156 U.S. 296\n 39 L. ed. 430, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 68, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 367), or, at all events, is so persuasively made manifest by the authorities cited and the reasoning which sustained the ruling of the court in the case just stated, as to leave no room for controversy on the subject (pp. 306, 307) Moreover, the power which the state government possessed to classify and regulate itinerant venders or peddlers, exerted in the statute under consideration, is cumulatively sustained and made, if possible, more obviously lawful by the fact that the regulation in question deals with the selling by itinerant venders or peddlers of drugs or medicinal compounds,-objects plainly within the power of government to regulate.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","12":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBACON v.

The order is alleged to violate the 14th Amendment. The commission moved to dismiss the bill on the ground that until the appellee had taken the appeal from the order to the supreme court of the state that is provided \n\n[232 U.S. 134, 137]\n\u00a0\n for by Pub. Stat. (Vt.) 1906,  4599, 4600, it ought not to be heard to complain elsewhere. The motion was overruled, and the defendants not desiring to pleead, an injunction was issued as prayed.\n The defendants rely upon Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co. \n211 \nU.S. 210, 229\n, 230 S., 53 L. ed. 150, 160, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 67. The ground of that decision was that by the state Constitution an appeal to the supreme court of appeals from an order of the state corporation commission, fixing rates, was granted, with power to the court to substitute such order as, in its opinion, the commission should have made. The court was given legislative powers, and it was held that in the circumstances it was proper, before resorting to the circuit court of the United States, to make sure that the officials of the state would try to establish an unconstitutional rule. But it was laid down expressly that at the judicial stage the railroads had a right to resort to the courts of the United States at once. p. 228. Therefore before that case can apply it must be established at least that legislative powers are conferred upon the supreme court of the state of Vermont.\n The appeal in Vermont is given by statute, not by the Constitution, which separates legislative, executive, and judicial powers. Chap. 2,  6. The material provisions are as follows:  4599. 'Any party to a cause who feels himself aggrieved by the final order, judgment, or decree of said . . . [commission] shall have the right to take the cause to the supreme court by appeal, for the correction of any errors excepted to in its proceedings, or in the form or substance of its orders, judgments, and decrees, on the facts found and reported by said . . . [commission].' By  4600 appeals are to be taken in the manner and under the laws and rules of procedure that govern appeals from the court of chancery. 'The supreme court shall have the same power therein as it has over appeals from such court. It may reverse or affirm the judgments, orders, or decrees of said . . . [commission] \n\n[232 U.S. 134, 138]\n\u00a0\n and may remand a cause to said . . . [commission] with such mandates as law or equity shall require; and said . . . [commission] shall enter judgment, order, or decree in accordance with such mandates.' Pub. Stat. 1906. It is apparent on the face of these sections that they do not attempt to confer legislative powers upon the court. They only provide an alternative and more expeditious way of doing what might be done by a bill in equity. Whether the alternative is exclusive or concurrent, whether it opens matters that would not be open upon a bill or not, if exceptions are taken (which does not appear in this case), is immaterial; the remedy in any event is purely judicial: to exonerate the appellant from an order that exceeds the law. This, we underatand, is the view taken by the supreme court of the state (Bacon v. Boston & M. R. Co. 83 Vt. 421, 457, 76 Atl. 128; Sabre v. Rutland R. Co. 86 Vt. 347, 368, 369, 85 Atl. 693; and this being so, by the rule laid down in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., the railroad company was free to assert its rights in the district court of the United States.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","13":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBAER BROS. MERCANTILE CO. v. DENVER & R. G. R. CO.(1914)\nNo. 140\nArgued: Decided: April 27, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 479, 480]\n\u00a0\n Between July, 1902, and March, 1907, the Baer Brothers Mercantile Company was engaged in the liquor business at Leadville, Colorado. During those years it purchased beer from a brewing company in St. Louis, Missouri, which delivered the same in carload lots to the Missouri Pacific, which acknowledged the receipt of the beer 'in good order to be delivered to the Baer Brothers Company at Leadville, Colorado, via the Denver & Rio Grande.' No through bill of lading was issued, and as the two companies had not established a through route, each shipment was waybilled to Pueblo, Colorado, 923 miles distant, on the Missouri Pacific's local rate of 45 cents per cwt. The car was then delivered to the Denver & Rio Grande with an expense bill which described the shipment and disclosed the charges paid by or due to the Missouri Pacific. The Denver & Rio Grande then forwarded the beer to Leadville, Colorado, 160 miles from Pueblo, at its local rate of 45 cents per cwt., naming the Missouri Pacific as consignor and the Baer Company as consignee. Whether collected in advance at St. Louis or at destination in Leadville, the freight was always divided between the two companies according to their local rates, the Denver & Rio Grande in every instance receiving 45 cents per cwt. on every shipment.\n The Baer Company insisted that the rate was unreasonable in fact and unjustly discriminatory, and in 1906 brought suit, in the United States circuit court for the district of Colorado, against both carriers, to recover from them $6,300, the amount of the unreasonable rate alleged to have been paid on beer. That suit was voluntarily dismissed by plaintiff upon the publication of the decision in the Abilene Case, \n204 U.S. 426\n, 51 L. ed. 553, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 350, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075. \n\n[233 U.S. 479, 481]\n\u00a0\n The Baer Company then instituted proceedings before the Commerce Commission in which it prayed that the 90 cent rate should be declared unreasonable and unjust; that the Commission would establish a new and just rate on beer between St. Louis and Leadville, and that the two companies be required to pay plaintiff $7,299 as reparation for excess freight paid on beer shipped over the two lines between July, 1902, and March, 1907\n\n\n At the hearing it was admitted that the Missouri Pacific's charge of 45 cents for the haul of 923 miles from St. Louis to Pueblo was reasonable. In view of this admission the subsequent proceedings before the Commission involved an investigation as to the reasonableness of the Denver & Rio Grande's charge of 45 cents for hauling beer a distance of 160 miles, from Pueblo, Colorado, to Leadville, Colorado. The carrier insisted that in each instance the beer had been received by it as an independent shipment at Pueblo, Colorado, where a new waybill was issued and the car forwarded as an intrastate shipment to Leadville on an intrastate rate. It claimed that the Commission had no jurisdiction to inquire as to the reasonableness of such intrastate rate. It further contended that the rate of 45 cents was just and fair.\n It appeared that although no through route had been established by the two roads, the regular filed tariff of the Missouri Pacific named 45 cents as the rate on beer between St. Louis and Pueblo. The Denver & Rio Grande had filed no tariff under the commerce act, but, in compliance with the request of the Commission, addressed to all railroads, it had furnished a copy of tariffs showing its intrastate rates generally, and that the local rate on beer from Pueblo to Leadville was 45 cents per cwt.\n At the conclusion of the hearing, the Commission held (13 Inters. Com. Rep. 329) that, even though no through route or through rate had been established, the Denver & Rio Grande, in hauling this beer, was engaged in interstate \n\n[233 U.S. 479, 482]\n\u00a0\n commerce; that the mountainous character of the country through which the road was built and the steep grades made the cost of operation higher than for a similar distance on the Missouri Pacific, but ruled that, while this was true, the rate of 45 cents from Pueblo to Leadville was excessive to the extent of 15 cents per cwt. The report concluded as follows:\n'The prayer of the complaint is, among other things, that the Commission fix 'a just rate for the through transportation of beer in carload lots from said city of St. Louis to said city of Leadville.' There is no suggestion either in the complaint or in the prayer looking to the establishment of a joint rate, and that subject was not referred to either upon the trial or in the argument. This being so, we ought not to establish a joint through rate, and we do not think that we should undertake by our order to fix in this proceeding the locals which will make up the charge for the through movement in the future. There has been no practical difficulty in making these shipments over this route in the past. If the Denver & Rio Grande does not reduce its charges in accordance with this report, or if suitable through facilities are denied, the complainant can file its petition asking the establishment of a joint through route and rate.'\n\n Thereupon the following reparation order was entered April 6, 1908:\n'This case being at issue upon complaint and answers on file, and having been duly heard and submitted by the parties, and full investigation of the matters and things involved having been had, and the Commission having, on the date hereof, made and filed a report containing its conclusions thereon:\n\n'It is ordered that the defendant, the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad Company, be and it is hereby notified and required to pay unto the complainant, the Baer Brothers Mercantile Company, of Leadville, Colorado, on \n\n[233 U.S. 479, 483]\n\u00a0\n or before the 1st day of June, 1908, the sum of $3,438.27, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from May 6, 1907, as reparation for excessive and unreasonable charges for the transportation of 2,292,178 pounds of beer from Pueblo, Colorado, to Leadville, Colorado, as part of a through transportation from St. Louis, Missouri, to said Leadville, as more fully and at large appears in the report of the Commission in this case.'\n\n The Denver & Rio Grande refused to pay the amount of reparation awarded, and thereupon the Baer Company brought suit against it in the United States circuit court for the district of Colorado, attaching to the complaint a copy of the award of the Commission.\n By demurrer and plea the defendant attacked the jurisdiction of the Commerce Commission to pass upon the reasonableness of its rate between Pueblo and Leadville. It further contended that the Commission could not make an order of reparation unless at the same time, and as a part of such order, it fixed a through rate to be charged in the future. These objections were overruled, and thereupon the plaintiff introduced the report and order of the Commission, proved the weight of the beer shipped, the rate of freight paid, and that the freight on beer for the longer distance between St. Louis and Salt Lake City, via the Missouri Pacific and the Denver & Rio Grande, was 70 cents per cwt.\n The defendant then offered evidence to show that Leadville was not on the through line, and was reached by a road 4 2\/1 miles long, the operation of which was unusually expensive because of the very steep grade throughout its entire length.\n Defendant also introduced testimony for the purpose of showing that the beer, though forwarded by the Missouri Pacific to be delivered in Leadville, was actually received at Pueblo by the Denver & Rio Grande as an independent shipment, as though originating at Pueblo, \n\n[233 U.S. 479, 484]\n\u00a0\n and was then forwarded as an intrastate shipment on a local waybill. The court overruled the various contentions of the defendant, and directed a verdict for the plaintiff for $3,761.45, being amount of the reparation order, with interest. The court also allowed attorney fees to the plaintiff. The case was then taken by the Denver & Rio Grande to the circuit court of appeals which held (109 C. C. A. 337, 187 Fed. 486) that it was not necessary to decide whether the Interstate Commerce Commission had jurisdiction to pass upon the reasonableness of the rate of 45 cents from Pueblo, Colorado, to Leadville, Colorado, saying that 'an order of reparation without such an establishment of a reasonable maximum rate is beyond the power of the Commission and void; and as no such rate was prescribed and no order forbidding the future use of an excessive rate was made in the case in hand, the Commission's order of reparation in this case was beyond its power and void. This conclusion disposes of the case in hand and renders it impossible for a judgment to be obtained against the railroad company upon the reparation order of the Commission upon which the action is based. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the other questions in the case and the judgment below is reversed.' A mandate issued in which it was 'ordered that this case be and the same is hereby remanded to the said circuit court with direction for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion of this court.'\n The Baer Brothers Company then brought the case here by writ of error.\n Mr. William B. Harrison for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. E. N. Clark, Joel F. Vaile, and J. G. McMurry for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Lamar:\n\n\n[233 U.S. 479, 486]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n In proceedings before the Commerce Commission the plaintiff secured an order requiring the defendant to pay it $3,438.27 as reparation for unreasonable freight rates charged and collected, the fixing of a new and just rate being left for future decision. The carrier failed to make the payment required, and the plaintiff thereupon brought suit and recovered judgment for the sum awarded, together with interest and attorneys' fees. This judgment was reversed by the circuit court of appeals, which held that the order was void on its face, and could not be the basis of a recovery for the reason that, while reparation had been awarded on the ground that the old rate was unreasonable, the Commission had not fixed a new and just rate for the future.\n\n 1. \nThat the two subjects of reparation and rates may be dealt with in one order is undoubtedly true. Texas & P. R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co. \n204 U.S. 446\n, 51 L. ed. 561, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 350, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075; Robinson v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. \n222 U.S. 509\n, 56 L. ed. 289, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 114. But awarding reparation for the past and fixing rates for the future involve the determination of matters essentially different. One is in its nature private and the other public. One is made by the Commission in its quasi judicial capacity to measure past injuries sustained by a private shipper; the other, in its quasi legislative capacity, to prevent future injury to the public. But testimony showing the unreasonableness of a past rate may also furnish information on which to fix a reasonable future rate, and both subjects can be, and often are, disposed of by the same order. This, \n\n[233 U.S. 479, 487]\n\u00a0\n however, is not necessarily so. Indeed, under the original commerce act, the two matters could not possibly be combined in a single order for the reason that, while at that time the Commission could order the carrier to desist from unreasonable practices and award damages, it could not fix rates. This brought about an anomalous state of affairs. For if the shipper obtained his order of reparation because of unreasonable charges which the railroad company was ordered to discontinue, a slightly different, but still unreasonable, rate might be put in for the future, which the shipper had to pay and again institute proceedings for reparation. 24 Stat. at L. 384,  15, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3165.\n\n 2. \nThis situation was dealt with by the Hepburn act, which, in addition to the existing power to make reparation conferred upon the Commission the new power to make rates for the future. But the two matters were treated as different subjects and were dealt with in separate sections. Section 4 conferred the power of making rates. Section 5 gave the Commission power to make reparation orders. 34 Stat. at L. 589, 590,  4, 5, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, pp. 1297, 1301. Not only were the two functions separately treated, but an analysis of the act shows that there is no such necessary connection between them as to make the quasi judicial order for reparation depend for its validity upon being joined with a quasi legislative order fixing rates. Persons entitled to one may have no interest in the other. Persons interested in both may be entitled to reparation, and not to a new rate; or to a new rate, and not to reparation. For example,  13 permits 'any mercantile, agricultural, or manufacturing society or any body politic or municipal organization to make complaints against the carrier.' On the application of such bodies, old rates might be declared unjust and new rates established; but, of course, no reparation would be given, for the reason that such \n\n[233 U.S. 479, 488]\n\u00a0\n complainants were not shippers, and therefore not entitled to an award of pecuniary damages. Cf. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n227 U.S. 89\n, 57 L. ed. 431, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 185. Then, too, there are cases in which a rate, reasonable when made, becomes unreasonable as the result of a gradual change in conditions, so that no reparation is ordered even though a new rate be established for the future. Anadarko Cotton Oil Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. 20 Inters. Com. Rep. 43. Conversely, there may be cases where what was an unreasonable rate in the past is found to be reasonable at the date of the hearing. In such a case reparation would be awarded for past unreasonable charges collected, but no new rate would be established for the future.\n\n 3. \nIt may, however, be said that even in such a case, the order, while condemning the rate for the past, should contain a provision validating it for the future. But while this consideration might show that it was erroneous not to name the new rate, it would not follow that the order awarding reparation was void. The Hepburn act treats the two subjects as related, but independent. The grounds of complaint may be joint or separate, and the very fact that they may sometimes be separate shows that the presence of both is not jurisdictional, and that the absence of a provision for one need not operate to invalidate an order as to the other.\n This conclusion is strengthened by considering the hardships that would result from nullifying a reparation order for error in omitting a provision for the future rate. It would punish the shipper for the failure of the Commission. It would deprive him of his award of damages for his private injury, because of the Commission's omission to make a rate for the benefit of the public. The shipper might or might not intend to remain in business. He might or he might not be interested in future rates. He might have been able to prove unreasonableness as to the past without being able to furnish evidence as to what \n\n[233 U.S. 479, 489]\n\u00a0\n would be reasonable for the future. Or, the Commission might be in position to say with certainty that the rates had been unreasonable, and award reparation accordingly, but it might require a protracted and lengthy hearing to establish what would be just for the future. To make the shipper wait on such a finding, and deprive him of his present right to reparation, until the determination of an independent question, would work a hardship not contemplated by the act and not required by any of its provisions.\n The present case illustrates some of these features. The plaintiff's petition asked for reparation and that the Commission would establish just rates. On the hearing it appeared that there was no through route or joint rate, and that the established local charge of one of the carriers was just, while that of the other had not been established or included in a filed tariff and was also unjust. The evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding of damages against such carrier, but it did not show how the through rate should be divided between the two companies, one of which hauled 923 miles and the other 160 miles. The carriers did not ask for an extension of the time within which the reparation should be paid. The fact that they were given an opportunity to agree on a through rate and how it should be divided ought not to deprive plaintiff of its rights to damages for the past, under a reparation order which could not, by any possibility, be changed by any subsequent finding as to rates for the future.\n The report and order gave the plaintiff no preference over other shippers, since they showed that 15 cents of the rate charged by the Denver & Rio Grande was unreasonable. If such a finding of unreasonableness was not sufficiently general to inure to the benefit of all other shippers, they could, on application, have secured such a modification as to enable them to maintain a suit for the recovery of damages for unjust charges and collections in the past. \n\n[233 U.S. 479, 490]\n\u00a0\n So far as the future operation of the order was concerned, all shippers were left in the same position, where, from the necessity of the case, the old rate had to be paid until the time had elapsed within which a new and just through rate could be put into effect. But, however desirable it may have been to deal with the entire matter at one time, the joinder of the two subjects was not jurisdictional. There was no such necessary connection between the two as to make the order of reparation void because of the absence of a concurrent provision establishing a rate for the future.\n This conclusion makes it necessary to consider what judgment should have been entered by the circuit court of appeals (Baker v. Warner, \n231 U.S. 588\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 175). That necessitates an examination of the other assignments of error relied on by the railroad company.\n\n 4. \nThe Denver & Rio Grande claimed in the record in the court of appeals that the order was void on its face for the reason that the Commission was without jurisdiction to pass upon the reasonableness of the rate from Pueblo, Colorado, to Leadville, Colorado. But while there was no through rate and no through route, there was in fact a through shipment from St. Louis, Missouri, to Leadville, Colorado. Its interstate character could not be destroyed by ignoring the points of origin and destination, separating the rate into its component parts, and by charging local rates and issuing local waybills, attempting to convert an interstate shipment into intrastate transportation.\n For where goods shipped 'from a point in one state to a point in another are received in transit by a state common carrier, under a conventional division of the charges, such carrier must be deemed to have subjected its road to an arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment within the meaning of the act to regulate commerce.' Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. Interstate \n\n[233 U.S. 479, 491]\n\u00a0\n Commerce Commission, \n162 U.S. 193\n, 40 L. ed. 938, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 391, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 700. This common arrangement does not depend upon the establishment of a through route or the issue and recognition of a through bill of lading, but may be otherwise manifested. Ibid.\n That there was a common arrangement between the two carriers here was shown by the long-continued course in dealing, and the division of the freight, with the knowledge that it had been paid as compensation for the single haul. If there had been a failure on the part of one of the carriers to file the tariffs, that did not defeat the jurisdiction of the Commission to award reparation against that same carrier, when it was shown that its unreasonable charge of 45 cents per cwt. formed a part of the total rate of 90 cents per cwt. actually paid by the Baer Company.\n\n 5. \nThe dismissal of the suit brought in 1906, for the recovery of damages for collecting unreasonable freight rates, was not a bar to this proceeding for the reason that a voluntary dismissal of an action at law is in the nature of a nonsuit, and does not operate as a judgment on the merits.

THOMAS HAVERTY CO.(1914)\nNo. 87\nArgued: Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n Mr. Walter Bennett for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[232 U.S. 106, 107]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Aldis B. Browne, Alexander Britton, Evans Browne, J. L. B. Alexander, and George D. Christy for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Thomas Haverty Company, defendant in error, sued the Bank of Arizona in a district court of the territory of Arizona to recover $9,313. 90 upon a special agreement set out in the complaint substantially as follows: That in February, 1908, the company had a claim against one John Noble for $14,306, for materials furnished and work done in the construction of the Noble Building, in Phoenix, Arizona; that the company had taken the necessary steps, under the provisions of the mechanics' lien statutes, to fix a lien upon the building and the lands on which it stood; that in March, 1908, the company instituted a suit to enforce the lien and the payment of the claim; that Noble, one Hugo Richards, and others, were joined as defendants in that action; that Richards at the time held a mortgage upon the premises, which had been given to him for the use and benefit of the Bank of Arizona, the bank being the real party in interest; that while the action was pending, and on or about November 30, 1908, it was agreed between the bank and the Haverty Company that if the company would prosecute its suit to judgment, the bank would buy its demand and claim of \n\n[232 U.S. 106, 108]\n\u00a0\n lien and pay the company for it the sum of $9,313.90 upon assignment of the judgment to the bank; the sum just mentioned being the amount claimed by the company ($14,306) less the sum of $4,992.10, which was the value of two boilers and a certain heating apparatus and certain tools, furnished by the Haverty Company and used in the construction of the building, and for which the company claimed a lien; which boilers, heating apparatus, and tools the company was to be at liberty to remove from the building if this could be done without injury thereto; that thereupon the company agreed to sell to the bank its demand against Noble and its claim for a lien upon the premises, and agreed to prosecute the action thereon to judgment, and to assign the judgment to the bank; that the company proceeded with its action, and recovered therein a judgment for $12,429.22, with a foreclosure of its lien; and that thereafter the company was ready and offered to assign the judgment to the bank, but the bank refused to receive it or to pay the agreed sum of $9,313.90 for it.\n The bank, by demurrer to the complaint, and afterwards by answer, interposed the defense that the company had failed to perform the agreement, in that it had recovered a judgment for only $12,429.22, and that although the claim for lien set up by the company in its suit against Noble was one alleged to be prior and superior to the lien of the mortgage held by Richards for the benefit of the bank, it was by the judgment in that suit determined to be inferior and subordinate to the bank's lien.\n There was a trial by jury, in the course of which it appeared that the alleged agreement, if made at all, was made between attorneys representing the Haverty Company, and attorneys representing the bank. The principal questions of fact were whether the agreement was made substantially as alleged, and, if so, then whether the bank's attorneys were specially authorized to make it, \n\n[232 U.S. 106, 109]\n\u00a0\n or whether the bank afterwards ratified their action with knowledge of the facts. There was a verdict for the plaintiff for the full amount claimed, and, on appeal, the resulting judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the territory (13 Ariz. 418, 115 Pac. 73); whereupon the present writ of error was sued out.\n It is insisted that the evidence fails to show that the attorneys who acted for the bank were authorized by it to enter into the alleged agreement to purchase the Haverty claim. But we think there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict of the jury in favor of plaintiff upon this question.\n It is also insisted that the parties never in fact came to an agreement, because an item of about $100 for certain freight charges was left open for further consideration. But the jury was warranted by the evidence in finding that an agreement had in fact been reached before the question respecting freight was raised.\n The principal contention here, as in the court below, is that the agreement alleged and proved was not performed, in that the Haverty Company did not prosecute its claim to judgment; the claim having been for $ 14,306, with a prior lien upon the building and lots, but subject to a deduction of $4,992.10, provided the boilers and tools could be removed without injury to the building; while the judgment recovered was for $12, 429.22, with a lien subordinate to the bank's mortgage. We agree with the court below that neither the averments of the complaint nor the evidence at the trial imported a guaranty on the part of the Haverty Company as to the exact amount of the judgment or the precise status of the lien. The evidence tended to show that the agreement was made as a compromise between the bank and the Haverty Company, in view of doubts that had arisen whether in law the lien of the Haverty Company was entitled to priority over the bank's mortgage. \n\n[232 U.S. 106, 110]\n\u00a0\n Error is assigned respecting certain remarks made by counsel for plaintiff in addressing the jury; but if there was any impropriety it was cured by the instructions of the trial judge.\n The only other point deserving notice is the contention that the motion of plaintiff in error (defendant below) for a direction of a verdict in its favor ought to have been granted because of  4, chap. 99, p. 230, Session Laws 1907 of Arizona, which is in effect that a contract for sale of any chose in action of the value of $500 or upwards shall not be enforceable unless some note or memorandum in writing be signed by the party to be charged, or his agent. Assuming-what is not clear-that the point was brought to the attention of the trial court, it is sufficient for present purposes to say that there is nothing in the record to show that the question was raised upon the appeal to the territorial supreme court.

ALEXANDER(1914)\nNo. 109\nArgued: Decided: January 12, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 117, 118]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Eugene S. Ives for appellants.\n Messrs. J. L. B. Alexander, William M. Seabury, Aldis B. Browne, Alexander Britton, and Evans Browne for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The proceeding out of which this case arises was brought by the appellant, Mrs. Barnes, for an account of the prop- \n\n[232 U.S. 117, 119]\n\u00a0\n erty received in settlement of certain mining suits and for a recovery of one fourth of the same. The defendants, Shattuck, Hanninger, and Marks, were parties to these suits, and employed as their attorneys the firm of Barnes & Martin and one O'Connell under an agreement that the lawyers should have as their compensation one fourth of all that was received by the said defendants. It may be assumed that Mrs. Barnes represented this claim. While the present suit was pending another firm, whose claim now is represented by the appellees, intervened and claimed one third of this contingent fee of one fourth. At the trial it appeared that the original defendants had paid to O'Connell the amount due; $18,750. Pending the suit O'Connell paid over $10,625 of this to Mrs. Barnes, retaining $6,250, and paying Martin, the junior member of the firm of Barnes & Martin, $1,875. The court entered no decree against the original defendants, but did decree that Mrs. Barnes was liable to the appellees for $6,250, being one third of the contingent fee. She appealed to the supreme court of the territory, but it affirmed the judgment below. 13 Ariz. 338, 114 Pac. 952. The other two appellants in this court are the sureties on her supersedeas bond.\n The main question is whether the facts set forth in the findings certified justify the conclusion of the courts below. The whole matter rests on conversations, in one of which Barnes said to Street and Alexander: 'If you will attend to this case I will give you one third of the fee which I have coming to me on a contingent fee from Shattuck, Hanninger, and Marks. Mr. O'Connell, who is associated with me, is entitled to the other third.' In others also he explained what his firm was to have, and told Street and Alexander that they should get one third of that if they would do certain work that he had not time to attend to. Street and Alexander did the work required, it does not matter whether it was more or less;-there \n\n[232 U.S. 117, 120]\n\u00a0\n was some attempt to raise a question about the fact, but we regard it as beyond dispute. The only serious argument is that, whatever they did, their compensation depended upon a personal promise that gave them no specific claim against the fund. For this proposition reliance is placed upon Trist v. Child (Burke v. Child) 21 Wall. 441, 22 L. ed. 623. In that case Child had an agreement with Trist that Child should take charge of a claim of Trist before Congress, and should receive 25 per cent of whatever sum Congress might allow. The suit alleged a lien on the sum allowed, and prayed that Trist might be enjoined from withdrawing the money from the Treasury, and might be decreed to pay the amount due. The bill was dismissed on the ground that the contract was illegal, but it was added that Child had no lien because it was forbidden by act of Congress, and also, it was said, because there was no sufficient appropriation of the fund, so that the only remedy, if there had been one, would have been at law. Wright v. Ellison, 1 Wall. 16, 17 L. ed. 555; Christmas v. Russell, 14 Wall. 69, 20 L. ed. 762. This decision, so far as it concerns us here, seems to have overlooked Wylie v. Coxe, 15 How. 415, 14 L. ed. 753, which decided that a contract for a contingent fee out of a fund awarded constituted a lien upon the fund. The remarks in Trist v. Child were not necessary to the decision, which was placed mainly on other grounds, so that at least we are warranted in treating the question as at large.\n It would be a strong thing to decide that there was nothing to warrant the conclusion, whether of law or fact, sanctioned by the highest court of a territory that since has become a state, upon a matter no longer subject to review by us. See Phoenix R. Co. v. Landis (Dec. 22, 1913 [\n231 U.S. 578\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 179]), But it might be our duty, and we pass that consideration by. We start, however, with the principle that an informal business transaction should be construed as adopting whatever form consistent with the facts is most fitted to reach the result seemingly desired. Sexton v. \n\n[232 U.S. 117, 121]\n\u00a0\n Kessler & Co. \n225 \nU.S. 90, 96\n, 97 S., 56 L. ed. 995, 999, 1000, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 657. Obviously the only thing intended or desired was to give the appellees a claim to one third of the fund received by Barnes if and when he should receive it. It is true that there was in a sense a res as to which present words of transfer might have been used. There was a right vested in Barnes, unless discharged, to try to earn a fee contingent upon success. But in a speculation of this sort the parties naturally turned their eyes toward the future and aimed at the fruits when they should be gained. They therefore used words of contract rather than of conveyance; but the important thing is not whether they used the present or the future tense, but the scope of the contract. In this case it aimed only at the fund. Barnes gave no general promise of reward; he did not even given a promise qualified and measured by success to pay anything out of his own property, referring to the fund simply as the means that would enable him to do it. See National City Bank v. Hotchkiss, \n231 \nU.S. 50, 57\n, 58 S. L. ed . --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 20. He promised only that if, when, and as soon as he should receive an identified fund, one third of it should go to the appellees. But he promised that. At the latest, the moment the fund was received the contract attached to it as if made at that moment. It is an ancient principle even of the common law that words of covenant may be construed as a grant when they concern a present right. Sharington v. Strotton, 1 Plowd. 298, 308; Hogan v. Barry, 143 Mass. 538, 10 N. E. 253; Ladd v. Boston, 151 Mass. 585, 588, 21 Am. St. Rep. 481, 24 N. E. 858. And it is one of the familiar rules of equity that a contract to convey a specific object even before it is acquired will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets a title to the thing. Mornington v. Keane, 2 DeG. & J. 292, 313, 27 L. J. Ch. N. S. 791 4 Jur. N. S. 981, 6 Week. Rep. 434; Holroyd v. Marshall, 10 H. L. Cas. 191, 211, 33 L. J. Ch. N. S. 193, 9 Jur. N. S. 213, 7 L. T. N. S. 172, 11 Week. Rep. 171, 10 Eng. Rul. Cas. 420.\n The obligation of Barnes was as definitely limited to payment out of the fund as if the limitation had been stated in words, and therefore creates a lien upon the \n\n[232 U.S. 117, 122]\n\u00a0\n principle not only of Wylie v. Coxe, supra, but of Ingersoll v. Coram, \n211 U.S. 335\n, 365-368, 53 L. ed. 208, 229, 230, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 92, which cites it and later cases. See further to the same point, Burn v. Carvalho, 4 Myl. & C. 690, 702, 703, 3 Jur. 1141; Rodick v. Gandell, 1 DeG. M. & G. 763, 777, 778, 12 Beav. 325, 19 L. J. Ch. N. S. 113, 13 Jur. 1087; Harwood v. La Grange, 137 N. Y. 538, 540, 32 N. E. 1000. It is suggested that there is an American doctrine opposed to that which is established in England. We know of no such opposition. There is or ought to be but one rule,-that suggested by plain good sense.\n After making their contracts the parties seem to have construed them as we have done. Barnes wrote to his partner, when they had succeeded in the cases concerned, in terms showing that he regarded their own claim as specific, 'to have one fourth of the ground,' the principle on which this suit was brought; and when a settlement was to be made he went to Phoenix and notified Street and Alexander. For the same reason the latter firm filed no claim against the estate of Barnes, thinking that it owed them nothing, but that they had one third of the contingent fee. It is not necessary to consider whether the lien attached to what we have called the res, before the fund was received, as a covenant to set apart rents and profits creates a lien upon the land. Legard v. Hodges, 1 Ves. Jr. 477, 4 Bro. Ch. 421. It is enough that it attached not later than that moment. We have considered the case upon the merits. The argument upon them for the appellants is mixed with others as to the sufficiency of the complaint in intervention. Upon the point of pleading we see no occasion to go behind the decision below. Phoenix R. Co. v. Landis, No. 61. Dec. 22, 1913 [\n231 U.S. 578\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 179].\n Another matter argued is that the appellees should not have been allowed to prove the payment made after the suit was begun. But the appellees properly were allowed to intervene in a suit to recover the fund. Rev. Stat. (Ariz.) 1901,  1278; London, P. & A. Bank v. Abrams, 6 Ariz. 87, 90, 53 Pac. 588; Louisville, E. & St. \n\n[232 U.S. 117, 123]\n\u00a0\n L. R. Co. v. Wilson, \n138 U.S. 501\n, 34 L. ed. 1023, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 405. Even if their lien was only inchoate when the suit was begun (which we do not intimate), they had a right to protect their interest, and of course were not deprived of it by the plaintiff's reaching the result that they also desired. Having a lien upon the fund, as soon as it was identified they could follow it into the hands of the appellant Barnes. On this point also we shall go into no question of pleading or procedure, but shall accept the decision of the territorial supreme court.\n The only remaining objection that seems to us to need a word of answer is that, as Mrs. Barnes only received $10,625, she should not have been charged with the whole third, $6,250. As the lien of the appellees attached to the whole two thirds of the quarter remaining to Barnes and Martin after taking out O'Connell's third, we do not see on what ground she could complain, if the objection is open. It seems probable that it is only an after-thought of counsel, and that the sum retained by Martin was what would come to him after deducting the share of Street and Alexander's fee that properly fell upon him as between him and his former partner's estate.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBARRETT v.

About one half of these wagons are stabled in Jersey City. Its shipments from New York City to the south and west are hauled to Jersey City and there loaded on express cars of the Pennsylvania Railroad; those destined to points east are taken to the terminal in New York city of the New York, New Haven , & Hartford Railroad; and there is also traffic for points on the New York, Ontario, & Western Railroad, and tributary thereto, which is carried to the terminal of that road at Weehawken, New Jersey. Shipments received from out of the state for delivery in New York city are taken by the company's vehicles to the consignees either directly from these railroad terminals or through intermediate distributing offices. The company also \n\n[232 U.S. 14, 29]\n\u00a0\n does a local business in the city of New York, and, in addition, receives packages for transportation between that city and such points within the state of New York as are on the line of the New York, New Haven, & Hartford Railroad. The interstate business, however, in the number of packages, comprises 98 per cent of the total business transacted in New York city, and, it being impracticable to effect a separation, the local and the other intrastate shipments are handled in the same vehicles, and by the same men, that are employed in connection with the interstate transportation. It was not until recently that the city sought to compel the company, in the transaction of this business, to comply with its license ordinances, although there have been ordinances requiring licenses for both express wagons and their drivers for over fifty years (Kent's ed. [ 1856]; Valentine's ed. \n\n[232 U.S. 14, 1859]\n\u00a0\n pp. 374, 375; Shepard & Shafer's ed. [1881 ]  380-386; Laird's ed. \n\n[232 U.S. 14, 1894]\n\u00a0\n  380-386; Percy & Collins's ed.  497- 504). The provisions here involved (except  315) received their present form in 1899. (Ord. app. May 22, 1899, ante, p. 25 note.) It is conceded that the company has never been compelled to obtain a license for the conduct of its interstate express business, and that its wagons and drivers employed therein have never been licensed, except 'that for several years last past about fourty licenses for wagons and drivers have been taken out.' The evidence shows that in 1908 an arrangement was made, by way of compromise, that the forty licenses should be issued (twenty having been taken out the year before). The company agreed to this number, without prejudice, asserting that it was larger in proportion to the total number of wagons than the local business warranted, and also that the latter was merely incidental to the interstate business, and hence not subject to the license requirements. In the fall of 1910, however, at a time when the business of the company was interrupted \n\n[232 U.S. 14, 30]\n\u00a0\n by a strike of its drivers, and it was endeavoring to replace those who had stopped work, the city, through its officers, undertook to enforce the ordinances with respect to all the wagons and drivers of the company, threatening to arrest unlicensed drivers of unlicensed wagons notwithstanding they might be engaged in interstate transportation, and to remove, if necessary, unlicensed wagons from the streets. This was the occasion of the present suit.\n The circuit court held that  305 and 306 were inoperative so far as they purported to require the complainant to obtain a local license for transacting its interstate business, and further, that the requirement of licenses as to express automobiles and chauffeurs had been superseded by a state statute (Laws of 1910, chap. 374). To this extent the city and its officers, who were codefendants, were enjoined. But with respect to the payment of license fees for express wagons and drivers, and the other regulations which we have briefly described, the court held that the enactments were valid and an injunction was refused. 189 Fed. 268. Both parties appeal, the company insisting that it was entitled to the entire relief sought, and the city, that no relief whatever should have been granted.\n In restraining the enforcement of  305 and 306, as stated, we think that the court was right. In the absence of a controlling state decision construing the group of ordinances in question and the statute authorizing the city to license businesses (Greater New York charter,  51), we are not satisfied that they were designed, despite the broad definition contained in  330, to apply to interstate business. The practical construction which they received before the present controversy arose is very persuasive to the contrary (New York City v. New York City R. Co. 193 N. Y. 543, 549, 86 N. E. 565; United States v. Cerecedo Hermanos y Compa nia, \n209 \nU.S. 338, 339\n, 52 S. L. ed. 821, 822, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 532.) But, if the above-mentioned sections are \n\n[232 U.S. 14, 31]\n\u00a0\n to be deemed to require that a license must be obtained as a condition precedent to conducting the interstate business of an express company, we are of the opinion that, so construed, they would be clearly unconstitutional. It is insisted that, under the authority of the state, the ordinances were adopted in the exercise of the police power. But that does not justify the imposition of a direct burden upon interstate commerce. Undoubtedly, the exertion of the power essential to assure needed protection to the community may extend incidentally to the operations of a carrier in its interstate business, provided it does not subject that business to unreasonable demands and is not opposed to Federal legislation.

It must, however, be confined to matters which are appropriately of local concern. It must proceed upon the recognition of the right secured by the Federal Constitution. Local police regulations cannot go so far as to deny the right to engage in interstate commerce, or to treat it as a local privilege, and prohibit its exercise in the absence of a local license.

Kentucky, supra, 'a state law is unconstitutional and void which requires a party to take out a license for carrying on interstate commerce, no matter how specious the pretext may be for imposing it.'\n The requirements of  305 and 306, with the schedule \n\n[232 U.S. 14, 32]\n\u00a0\n of fees in  308, cannot be regarded as imposing a fee, or tax, for the use of the streets; if they were such, the question would at once arise as to the validity of the discrimination involved in such an exaction. Nor can they be considered as a regulation in the interest of safety in street traffic. Other ordinances provide for the 'rules of the road' to which wagons of express companies, as well as those of other persons, are subject (Code of Ordinances, chap. 12). The sections now under consideration constitute a regulation of the express 'business.' Article I. is entitled, 'Business Requiring a License;'  305, containing the enumeration, provides that 'the following businesses must be duly licensed;' and  306, that 'no person shall engage in or carry on any such business without a license therefor' under a stated penalty (ante, p. 24, note). The right of public control, in requiring such a license, is asserted by virtue of the character of the employment; but while such a requirement may be proper in the case of local or intrastate business, it cannot be justified as a prerequisite to the conduct of the business that is interstate. Not only is the latter protected from the action of the state, either directly or through its municipalities, in laying direct burdens upon it, but, in the present instance, Congress has exercised its authority and has provided its own scheme of regulation in order to secure the discharge of the public obligations that the business involves. Act of June 29, 1906, chap. 3591, 34 Stat. at L. 584, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1288; Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 \nU.S. 491, 505\n, 57 S. L. ed. 314, 319, 44 L.R.A. 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148; United States v. Adams Exp. Co. \n229 U.S. 381\n, 57 L. ed. 1237, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 878.\n It would seem to follow, necessarily, that the annual license fees prescribed by  308 (ante, p. 25, note) cannot be exacted, so far as the interstate business is concerned. They cannot be regarded as coming within the category of inspection fees, which are sustained when fairly commensurate with the cost of local supervision of such matters as are under local control (Western U. Teleg. Co. v. \n\n[232 U.S. 14, 33]\n\u00a0\n New Hope, \n187 \nU.S. 419, 425\n, 47 S. L. ed. 240, 243, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 204; Atlantic & P. Teleg. Co. v. Philadelphia, \n190 \nU.S. 160, 164\n, 47 S. L. ed. 995, 1000, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 817). The provisions of  308 are inseparably connected with those of  305 and 306. The sums fixed 'for each express wagon' and 'for each driver' measure the amount to be exacted for the granting of the license required for the carrying on of business. And it is difficult to see how the payment can be enforced as to the interstate business if the taking out of the license therefor cannot be compelled.\n Similar considerations are controlling with respect to the provision of  332 for the giving of license bonds. This in terms is related to the requirement of  305. It is provided that a bond shall be given 'for each and every vehicle licensed,' and it is to be conditioned 'for the safe and prompt delivery of all baggage, packages,' etc., intrusted to the owner or driver 'of any such licensed express.' As applied to the company's business of interstate transportation, it must fall with the provision regarding the license, and, further, it must be regarded as repugnant to the exclusive control asserted by Congress in occupying the field of regulation with regard to the obligations to be assumed by interstate express carriers. Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, supra; Southern R. Co. v. Reid, \n222 U.S. 424\n, 56 L. ed. 257, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 140; Southern R. Co. v. Reid, \n222 \nU.S. 444, 447\n, 56 S. L. ed. 263, 264, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 145.\n Section 315 provides for separate licenses for drivers. We may assume the propriety of suitable provision to insure careful driving over the city streets, and the existence of ample power to meet this local necessity. It is also clear that regulations for this purpose, when the movement of interstate traffic is involved, should be entirely reasonable and should not arbitrarily restrict the facilities upon which it must depend. If the provision of  315 could be regarded as severable from the requirement of a license for the conduct of business, we should still have great difficulty in sustaining it as a reasonable regu- \n\n[232 U.S. 14, 34]\n\u00a0\n lation with regard to drivers employed in the interstate transportation which has been described. Reading  315 in connection with  307, as we understand the city contends it should be read, no driver can be licensed except a citizen of the United States, or one who has regularly declared intention to become a citizen, and the assurance of his qualifications does not depend simply upon the applicant's ability to meet appropriate tests so as to satisfy the official judgment, but the application must be accompanied by the indorsement in writing of two reputable residents of the city testifying to his competence. When the importance to the entire country of promptness and facility in the conduct of the business of the express companies in New York City, and the obvious convenience of their being able to secure drivers in Jersey City as well as in New York, are considered, the provision would seem to be unnecessarily burdensome. We are not called upon, however, to decide this point. Section 315 relates exclusively to drivers of a 'licensed hack or express.' There is no such provision as to drivers of wagons generally. While the driver's license is separate, the ordinance refers only to such drivers as are employed in the business for the carrying on of which a license may be required. Whatever might otherwise be the city's power as to the regulation of drivers, this provision cannot be divorced from the license scheme of which it is a part.\n Other requirements, such as the marking of the vehicles with their official numbers, the exhibition of licenses upon demand, and the inspection of 'licensed vehicles and places of business' have obvious reference to the same license plan.\n We conclude that the complainant was entitled to an injunction restraining the enforcement of the ordinances in question against the company with respect to the conduct of its interstate business and its wagons and drivers \n\n[232 U.S. 14, 35]\n\u00a0\n employed in interstate commerce. In this view it is unnecessary to consider whether the ordinances have been superseded, as to automobiles, by the state statute.\n The decree of the Circuit Court is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court, with direction to enter a decree in favor of the complainant in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","17":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBERWIND-WHITE COAL MINING CO. v.

(171 Ill. App. 302.) There are only two alleged Federal contentions:\n\n 1. \nThat allowing the demurrage conflicted with the act to regulate commerce because no tariff on the subject was filed or published. The fact is that the railroad had complied with the law as to filing tariff sheets, and had also, long before the time in question, filed a book of rules of the Chicago Car Service Association, of which it was a member, relating to liability for demurrage, and a few days after had written the Commission a letter stating that the demurrage charge would be $1 per day. The argument is that such documents were not sufficiently formal to comply with the law, and hence afforded no ground for allowing demurrage. But the contention is without merit. The documents were received and placed on file by the Commission without any objection whatever as to their form, and it is certain that, as a matter of fact, they were adequate to give notice. Equally without merit is the insistence that there was no proof that the documents were posted for public inspection. Texas & P. R. Co. v. Cisco Oil Mill, \n204 U.S. 449\n, 51 L. ed. 562, 27 Sup. Ct.

The facts are these: The storage tracks of the railroad for cars billed to Chicago for re-consignment were at Hammond, Indiana, a considerable distance from the terminals of the company nearer the center of the city, but were convenient to the belt line by which cars could be transferred to any desired new destination, and the holding on such tracks of cars consigned as were those in question was in accordance with \n\n[235 U.S. 371, 376]\n\u00a0\n a practice which had existed for more than twenty years.

The alleged liability under the statute was challenged, and if it existed the statute was alleged to be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and right to interest was denied. The court held the statute to be constitutional, and judgment was awarded for the sum claimed, but the prayer for interest was rejected. Error was prosecuted directly from this court by the defendant, and from the circuit court of appeals by the United States; the first because of the constitutional questions, and the second because of the disallowance of interest. The circuit court of appeals certified a question concerning the right to recover interest, and the two cases before us consist of the direct writ of error on the one hand and the certificate on the other. Both writs of error when taken were authorized. Railroad Commission v. Worthington, \n225 U.S. 101\n, 56 L. ed. 1004, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 653; Macfadden v.

United States, \n207 U.S. 425\n, 52 L. ed. 278, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 163. The circuit court of appeals, however, has no power to ask instructions upon an issue which it has no right to decide, and we have no authority to instruct on such a subject, or to refuse to decide issues which are properly before us for judgment.\n Under these conditions, we think the better practice is \n\n[232 U.S. 261, 277]\n\u00a0\n as regards the controversy as to interest, which was taken to the circuit court of appeals by writ of error, and in which cases the certificates now before us were drawn, to treat the writ of error from the circuit court of appeals as in substance pending here on a cross writ by the United States; and as without further orders the record is in such a condition as to enable us to decide the whole case, we proceed to do so.\n Section 37 of the tariff act of August 5, 1909, chap. 6, 36 Stat. at L. 112, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1197, provided in part as follows:\n'There shall be levied and collected annually on the first day of September by the collector of customs of the district nearest the residence of the managing owner, upon the use of every foreign-built yacht, pleasure boat, or vessel, not used or intended to be used for trade, now or hereafter owned or chartered for more than six months by any citizen or citizens of the United States, a sum equivalent to a tonnage tax of seven dollars per gross ton.'\n\n The second paragraph of the provision, which we need not quote, gives the right to the owner of any 'foreign-built yacht, pleasure boat, or vessel above described' to pay a duty of 35 per cent ad valorem, and thus secure an exemption from the tax provided by the first paragraph.\n The act went into effect on August 6, 1909, and the collector of the port of New York thereafter made a demand upon C. K. G. Billings, the plaintiff in error, for the payment of $7,644; that is, of the sum produced by calculating $7 per ton on 1,091.71 tons, the tonnage of the foreign-built yacht Vanadis, owned and controlled by him.\n Failing to pay, in January, 1911, the United States sued in the court below to recover the tax. The defendant was alleged to be a citizen of the United States, and the suit was averred to have been brought in the district nearest his residence. The ownership and use by him of the pleasure yacht Vanadis, an English foreign-built vessel, \n\n[232 U.S. 261, 278]\n\u00a0\n the levy based upon her tonnage according to the statute of the amount of $ 7,644, the demand for payment, the failure to pay on the 1st day of September, 1909, under the statute, were all alleged, and recovery of the tax as well as of interest was prayed. The answer admitted citizenship and the ownership of the yacht, and that she was a foreign-built pleasure craft, but set up three distinct defenses; the first, that the vessel was not enrolled, registered, or documented as a vessel of the United States, and enjoyed no privileges because she was of that character. It was expressly admitted that 'during the year preceding the 1st day of September, 1909,' the said yacht 'has been used by the defendant outside of the waters and territorial limits or jurisdiction of the United States from time to time and at various times . . . and was not used for six months during such year within the waters and territorial limits or jurisdiction of the United States or elsewhere.'\n The second defense expressly averred that the tax imposed by the statute was intended by Congress to be 'an annual tax, that it should be prospective, and operate only upon the future use of any such foreign- built yacht, pleasure boat, or vessel, and that said annual tax did not accrue and could not be duly levied and collected prior to the 1st day of September in the year 1910.'\n The third defense after fully averring that there were within the United States many pleasure yachts not foreign built which were in use, and whose use was identical with that of a foreign-built yacht like the one which the defendant used, charged that the law imposing the burden sought to be enforced was void because repugnant to the due process clause of the 5th Amendment. The case was submitted to the court on bill and answer; and as we at the outset said, there was a judgment holding that the sum claimed was due by the defendant as an excise or duty upon the use of his yacht, and that the act imposing \n\n[232 U.S. 261, 279]\n\u00a0\n the tax was not repugnant to the Constitution, but that the government was not entitled to recover interest.\n To avoid, if it may be, the necessity of determining the constitutional question, we shall first decide what, if any, burden the statute imposes, and then, if necessary, consider its asserted repugnancy to the Constitution. In view of the requirement that direct taxes be apportioned, and assuming, as we do assume, that the act before us was adopted by Congress in the light of the ruling in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & T. Co. \n157 U.S. 429\n, 39 L. ed. 759, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 673, \n158 U.S. 601\n, 39 L. ed. 1108, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 912, it is certain that the tax levied by the provision was intended to be an excise tax upon 'the use of every foreign-built yacht, pleasure boat, or vessel . . . now or hereafter owned or chartered for more than six months by any citizen or citizens of the United States.' This is not seriously, if at all, disputed in argument, the controversy turning first upon the period when the tax provided for is to take effect, and the nature and character of the use which is taxed. These subjects are so interwoven that we consider and dispose of them together.\n Was the tax due on the 1st day of September, 1909, or was it only due on the same day in September, 1910? In view of the positive direction that the tax shall be levied and collected on the 1st day of September, we can see no escape from the conclusion that the court below was right in holding that it became due on the 1st day of September after the passage of the act. The word 'annually,' upon which so much reliance to the contrary is placed, is manifestly used not for the purpose of postponing the time of payment, but rather as provision for continuity; that is, the word but shows the purpose of fixing the annual duty of levying and collecting the tax on the designated day. This becomes quite apparent when it is observed that if the word 'annually' be removed, there would be room for the implication that the tax was to be but sporadic, and would therefore cease to \n\n[232 U.S. 261, 280]\n\u00a0\n be collectible after one payment. And it is equally clear that the six months clause is concerned not with the period when the tax imposed shall be levied and collected, but addresses itself to the subject-matter upon which the tax is placed; in other words, it qualifies the word 'charter,' and therefore only indicates when the use of a chartered vessel shall become subject to the duty imposed. The tax being leviable and collectible on the 1st of September in each year after the passage of the act, upon what was it assessed is the question. It seems difficult to answer it in clearer terms than does the text of the act when it provides that it shall be upon the use of the yachts with which the provision is concerned. But it is said to respond in the language of the act leaves the question virtually unanswered, since the extent of the use and its essential period are left wholly undetermined. But this is a misconception based upon a disregard of the fact that the word 'use' in the text is unqualified, from which it results that the recurrence of the tax is annual and depends upon two elements,-ownership or charter rights, as specified in the act, and use for any time during the year. It is to be observed that the provision deals with ownership, and distinguishes between ownership and use, since it bases the tax not upon the former, but upon the latter. From this it follows that it is not ownership, but the election during the taxing period of the owner to take advantage of one of the elements which are involved in ownership,-the right to use which is the subject upon which the statute places the excise duty. In this view the fact of use, not its extent or its frequency, becomes the test, as distinguished from mere ownership, for that, in the statutory sense, could exist without use having taken place. The words of the statute under this construction were used in an every-day sense, and not in a technical one: in other words, but convey the distinction without reference to nice analysis of the nature of things which is \n\n[232 U.S. 261, 281]\n\u00a0\n commonly conceived to exist between ownership and use. Let it be conceded that the ownership of property includes the right to use; plainly we think, as use and ownership are distinguished one from the other in the provision, the word 'use,' as there employed, means more than the mere privilege of using which the owner enjoys, and relates to its primary signification, as defined by Webster: 'The act of employing anything or of applying it to one's service; the state of being so employed or applied.' If the use which arises from the fact of ownership, without more, was what the statute proposed, then it is inconceivable why the difference between use and ownership was marked in the provision and made the basis of the tax which it imposed. While this construction in this case leads to the same conclusion as does that which the court below affixed to the statute, that is, that it taxed the privilege of use, or, in other words, the potentiality of using involved in ownership, inherently there is this fundamental difference between the interpretation we give and that which the lower court adopted, since the privilege of use is purely passive (or subjective),-a right which necessarily pertains to ownership and must exist where there is ownership, as one may not obtain ownership without acquiring the privileges of use which ownership gives. The other, on the contrary, that is, use in the statutory sense, although it arises from ownership, is active (objective); that is, it is the outward and distinct exercise of a right which ownership confers, but which would not necessarily be exerted by the mere fact of ownership. The contention that inequality must be the result from making the tax depend upon mere use without reference to the extent of its duration addresses itself not to the question of power, and is therefore beyond the scope of judicial cognizance. But it is to be observed that it may well have been that the character of the property with which the statute deals and the mere element of \n\n[232 U.S. 261, 282]\n\u00a0\n caprice as to its use and the uncertainties of the subject led to the fact of making the use alone the criterion as the wiser and juster method of operating equally upon all. Again let it be conceded that the causing the tax for the annual period to become due in September, 1909, is to give it in some respects a retroactive effect, such concession does not cause the act to be beyond the power of Congress under the Constitution to adopt. Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. \n220 U.S. 107\n, 55 L. ed. 389, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312, and authorities there cited. While the rule is that statutes should be so construed as to prevent them from operating retroactively, that principle is one of construction, and not of reconstruction, and therefore does not authorize a judicial re-enactment by interpretation of a statute to save it from producing a retroactive effect.\n As under the meaning which we thus give the statute the admitted use of the vessel was within its provision, and therefore the amount due for excise was rightfully imposed, and under our interpretation was due when demanded, we must consider whether the asserted repugnancy of the statute to the Constitution is well founded.\n It has been conclusively determined that the requirement of uniformity which the Constitution imposes upon Congress in the levy of excise taxes is not an intrinsic uniformity, but merely a geographical one. Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. supra; McCray v. United States, \n195 U.S. 27\n, 49 L. ed. 78, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 44 L. ed. 969, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747. It is also settled beyond dispute that the Constitution is not self-destructive. In other words, that the powers which it confers on the one hand it does not immediately take away on the other; that is to say, that the authority to tax which is given in express terms is not limited or restricted by the subsequent provisions of the Constitution or the Amendments thereto, especially by the due process clause of the 5th Amendment. McCray v. United States, \n195 U.S. 27\n, 49 L. ed. 78, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561, and authorities there cited. \n\n[232 U.S. 261, 283]\n\u00a0\n Nor is there anything in Carroll v. Greenwich Ins. Co. \n199 U.S. 401\n, 50 L. ed. 246, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66, or Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 U.S. 78\n, 53 L. ed. 97, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 14, which in the remotest degree nullifies or restricts the principle thus stated. Indeed it is apparent, if the suggestion as to the meaning of those cases were assented to, it would result in rendering the Constitution unconstitutional. This certainly was the view entertained by the pleader when the answer in the case was prepared, since the sole attack on the constitutionality of the statute was based upon the assertion that it was repugnant to the due process clause of the 5th Amendment. And such also is the line of the argument at bar where the fundamental rights secured by the 5th Amendment are constantly referred to as the basis upon which the unconstitutionality of the statute is urged. Is there foundation for this claim under the 5th Amendment, is then the issue, and that, of course, requires a statement of the grievances which it is asserted result from upholding the tax. They all come to this,-that to impose a burden in the shape of a tax upon the use of a foreign-built yacht when a like tax is not imposed on the use of a domestic yacht under similar circumstances is so beyond the power of classification, so abhorrent to the sense of justice, and so repugnant to the conceptions of free government, as to be void even in the absence of express constitutional limitation. We do not stop to point out the obvious unsoundness of the contentions, nor, indeed, to direct attention to the self-evident demonstration of their want of merit even from the point of view of the power to classify, since the differences between things domestic and things foreign, and their use, are apparent on the face of things, and are expressly manifested by the text of the Constitution. We say we do not stop to do these things because in any event we are of opinion the conclusion cannot be escaped that the propositions, each and all of them, whatever may be their form of expression, are in substance and effect but an \n\n[232 U.S. 261, 284]\n\u00a0\n assertion that the tax which the statute imposes is void because of a want of intrinsic uniformity; and therefore all the contentions are adversely disposed of by the previous decisions of this court on that subject. That which is settled beyond dispute may not be disregarded and be brought into the realm of that which is controvertible and questionable by the mere garb in which propositions are clothed.\n Was the government entitled to interest? is then the remaining question which we must decide in view of the purpose which we at the outset expressed of treating the United States as here present, and urging its right to interest on a cross writ of error. The cyclopedias and textbooks state the doctrine to be that in the absence of a statute expressly so directing, taxes bear no interest. The principle is thus announced in 37 Cyc. p. 1165: 'Delinquent taxes do not bear interest unless it is expressly so provided by statute. But it is competent for the legislature to prescribe the payment of interest as a penalty for delay in the payment of taxes, and to regulate its rate. This however, can be effected only by an act plainly manifesting the legislative intention as to the right to recover interest, its amount, and the date from which it shall begin, the latter being ordinarily the time when the asessement is complete and the taxes become payable.' Cooley Taxn. p. 17; Sedgwick, Damages, 9th ed.  332; Sutherland, Damages, 3d ed.  337; Black, Tax Titles, 2d ed.  236, and see note in 6 L.R.A. (N.S.) p. 694. And the statement of the text is borne out by the decided cases in nearly all of the state courts of last resort. On the other hand, the government relies upon four cases in this court where interest was allowed as a matter of course on taxes due the United States. Sun Cheang-Kee v. United States, 3 Wall. 320 18 L. ed. 72; Western Union R. Co. v. United States, \n101 U.S. 543\n, 25 L. ed. 1068; Litch-field v. Webster County, \n101 U.S. 773\n, 25 L. ed. 925; United States v. Erie R. Co. 106 \n\n[232 U.S. 261, 285]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 327, 27 L. ed. 151, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 223. We say as a matter of course, because in the cases referred to, the subject was not discussed and the liability for interest was practically admitted. The government also relies on a careful and clear opinion by Maxey, Judge, in the circuit court for the western district of Texas, holding that interest was due to the United States on customs duties. United States v. Mexican International R. Co. 154 Fed. 519. Whether the practice applied in the previous decisions of this court should be now followed, or the theory established by the state cases adopted and made the rule as to taxes due the United States, is therefore the question. Its solution must depend not upon the mere authority of the state cases, but upon the conclusiveness of the principles upon which such cases rest, and their concurrence with the principles by which interest is allowed in the courts of the United States,- considerations which require us to determine the nature of the duty which arises from the liability for a tax imposed by the United States, not only inherently, but as well from the practice which has obtained in the past in the enforcement of the law of the United States, and the implication of legislative sanction, if any, to such practice which may have arisen. It would serve no purpose to refer to the abhorrence which obtained in early times concerning the payment of interest, and the evolution by which the legitimate character of interest was gradually understood, and it came to be recognized that its payment was, as a general principle, but the compensation due for the use of money, or that its allowance was merely for damages caused by delay in discharging a duty, and therefore in default on a contract to pay money, even without express legislation so directing, interest would be allowed. The subject was explained in National Bank v. Mechanics' Nat. Bank, \n94 U.S. 437\n, 24 L. ed. 176, and was reviewed in Reid v. Rensselaer Glass Factory, 3 Cow. 393, 5 Cow. 587. To avoid prolixity we do not review the \n\n[232 U.S. 261, 286]\n\u00a0\n state cases as to nonliability for interest on default for taxes, but content ourselves with stating that we think it is apparent that the conclusion which they sustain, leaving aside minor differences, rests upon two fundamental propositions: First, the necessity for an express statute providing for interest except in cases of contract, and second, that even where there is a statute providing for interest on all debts, such statute is not applicable to taxes because they are not debts, and therefore must be enforced alone by virtue of express legislative penalties, except where a provision exists giving eo nomine interest on taxes. But both of these propositions are in conflict with the settled doctrine established by the decision of this court. Thus, as to the necessity for a statute, it was long ago here decided, in view of the true conception of interest, that a statute was not necessary to compel its payment where, in accordance with the principles of equity and justice in the enforcement of an obligation, interest should be allowed. Young v. Godbe, 15 Wall. 562, 565, 21 L. ed. 250, 251:\n'It is said there is no law in the territory of Utah prescribing a rate of interest in transactions like the one in controversy in this suit, and that, therefore, no interest can be recovered. But this result does not follow. If there is no statute on the subject, interest will be allowed by way of damages for unreasonably withholding payment of an overdue account. The rate must be reasonable, and conform to the custom which obtains in the community in dealings of this character.'\n\n And the decisions of this court have often since exemplified the principle by considering the question of the responsibility for interest from the point of view of reason and justice, even though no express statute existed for compelling this payment. So, also, as to the nature and character of the obligation to pay taxes. As long ago as Meredith v. United States, 13 Pet. 486, 10 L. ed. 258, it was decided, the court speaking by Mr. Justice Story (p. 493): \n\n[232 U.S. 261, 287]\n\u00a0\n 'It appears to us clear upon principle, as well as upon the obvious import of the provisions of the various acts of Congress on this subject, that the duties due upon all goods imported constitute a personal debt due to the United States from the importer.'\n Again, in United States v. Chamberlin, \n219 U.S. 250\n, 55 L. ed. 204, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 155, the nature and character of an obligation to pay a stamp duty was considered, and the right to collect it by action of debt was passed upon, and it was held that the obligation to pay was a debt, and that it could be enforced by suit in the absence of an exclusive remedy created by the statute by which the obligation was imposed. In the course of the opinion, various decisions of this court recognizing the right of the United States to enforce internal revenue duties by suit were referred to, and the statute to the same end was cited, and its application to the case in hand was pointed out upon grounds which in reason may well be said to cause the statute to be applicable to the case here before us. In addition, in repeated adjudications in this court it has been settled that in a suit to recover taxes which have been illegally assessed, interest would be allowed against the official, although the real responsibility was on the government. The concluded doctrine on this subject was thus stated in a recent case after referring to the exemption of the United States from liability for interest (National Home v. Parrish, \n229 \nU.S. 494, 496\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1296, 1298, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 944):\n'On the contrary, in suits against collectors to recover moneys illegally exacted as taxes and paid under protest, the settled rule is, that interest is recoverable without any statute to that effect, and this although the judgment is not to be paid by the collector, but directly from the Treasury. Erskine v. Van Arsdale, 15 Wall. 75, 21 L. ed. 63; Redfield v. Bartels, \n139 U.S. 694\n, 35 L. ed. 310, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 683.'\n\n The conflict between the systems is pronounced and fundamental. In the one, the state rule, except as to \n\n[232 U.S. 261, 288]\n\u00a0\n contract; no interest without statute in the United States rule; interest in all cases where equitably due unless forbidden by statute. In one no suit for taxes as a debt without express statutory authority; in the other, the right to sue for taxes as for a debt in every case where not prohibited by statute.\n From this review it results that the doctrine as to nonliability to pay interest for taxes which have become due which prevails in the state courts is absolutely in conflict with the doctrine applied to the same subject in this court, and cannot now be made the rule without repudiating settled principles which have been here applied for many years in various aspects, and without in effect disregarding the sanction either expressly or impliedly given by Congress to such rules. From this it follows that although in the cases in this court to which we at the outset made reference which enforced the liability for interest, and which are here controlling if they be not now overruled, there was no controversy as to the liability for interest, this was presumably because the matter was deemed not disputable as the direct result of the then-settled doctrine that interest could be recovered by the United States on a default in payment of import duties. Under this condition we can see no ground for departing from the rule which the cases enforced, and we are therefore constrained to the conclusion that the court below was wrong in rejecting the prayer of the government for interest, and its action in that respect must be reversed, while in others it must be affirmed.\n Modified and affirmed. \n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOSTON & M. R. R. v. HOOKER(1914)\nNo. 121\nArgued: Decided: April 6, 1914\n\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 97, 99]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frederick N. Wier and Edgar J. Rich for plaintiff in error. \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 100]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Samuel Williston for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 97, 106]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n Katharine Hooker brought an action in the superior court of Middlesex county, Massachusetts, to recover from the Boston & Maine Railroad as a common carrier on account of the loss of certain baggage belonging to her, which had been transported by the defendant in interstate commerce from Boston, Massachusetts, to Sunapee Lake station, New Hampshire, on September 15, 1908. The plaintiff recovered a judgment for the value of the baggage lost, with interest. The case was taken to the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts upon exceptions of the defendant, and upon its rescript, returned to the \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 107]\n\u00a0\n superior court, overruling the exceptions (209 Mass. 598, 95 N. E. 945, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 669), judgment was there entered for the plaintiff for $2, 253.77.\n The defendant insists that the recovery of the plaintiff should have been limited to the sum of $100, in view of certain requirements made by it concerning the transportation of baggage, and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. From the findings of fact it appears that the baggage was checked upon a first-class ticket purchased for the plaintiff ( although not used by her, she traveling upon another similar ticket purchased by herself); that at the time the baggage was checked the plaintiff had no notice of the regulations hereinafter referred to, limiting the liability of the defendant (further than such notice is to be presumed from the schedules filed and posted as hereinafter stated); that no inquiry was made by the defendant on receiving the plaintiff's baggage as to its value: that there was no evidence that any more expensive or different mode of transportation was adopted for baggage the value of which was declared to exceed $100 than for other baggage; that any reasonable person would infer from the outward appearance of the plaintiff's baggage when tendered to the defendant for transportation that the value largely exceeded $100, and that the loss of plaintiff's baggage was due to the negligence of defendant.\n The court further found that previous to and during September, 1908, the defendant had published and kept open for inspection and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, in accordance with the act of Congress relating to interstate commerce and amendments thereto and the orders and regulations of the Commission, schedules giving the rates, fares, and charges for transportation between different points, including Boston and Sunapee Lake station, all terminal, storage, and other charges required by the Commission, all privileges and facilities granted or allowed, and all rules or regulations \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 108]\n\u00a0\n which in any way affected or determined such rates, fares, and charges or the value of the service rendered to passengers; that during the same time, in accordance with an order of the Commission of June 2, 1908, making comprehensive regulations as to rate and fare schedules, the defendant had placed with its agent in Boston all rate and fare schedules and the terminal and other charges applicable to that station, and had enabled and required him to keep in accessible form a file of such schedules, and had instructed him to give information contained therein to all seeking it, and to afford to inquirers opportunity to examine the schedules, and that the defendant in the manner shown and in all other ways conformed to the acts of Congress and the orders and regulations of the commission with reference to such schedules. The court also found that the schedules contained provisions limiting the free transportation of baggage to a certain weight, and the liability of the defendant to $100, followed by a table of charges for excess weight, and also contained the following provision:\n'For excess value the rate will be one half of the current excess baggage rate per 100 pounds for each $100, or fraction thereof, of increased value declared. The minimum charge for excess value will be 15 cents.\n\n'Baggage liability is limited to personal baggage not to exceed $100 in value for a passenger presenting a full ticket and $50 in value for a half ticket, unless a greater value is declared and stipulated by the owner and excess charges thereon paid at time of checking the baggage;' that the excess charge for transporting baggage valued at $1,904.50, which was the value of the baggage lost, from Boston to Sunapee Lake station during September, 1908, according to the schedules, was $4.75; that notices were posted at or near the offices where passenger's tickets were sold in the Boston \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 109]\n\u00a0\n station, stating that tariffs naming the rates on interstate traffic were on file with the agent, and would be furnished for inspection upon application, and that notices were posted in the baggage room of that station, in a conspicuous place, and in sight of persons using the room for checking baggage, reading that personal baggage not exceeding $100 in value would be checked free for each passenger on presentation of a first- class ticket, and containing information with reference to excess weight. And the court further found that the plaintiff did not declare at the time her baggage was checked that it exceeded $100 in value, and did not pay any charges for valuation in excess of that amount.\n\n It is to be borne in mind that the action as tried and decided in the state court was not for negligence of the railroad company as a warehouseman for the loss of the baggage after its delivery at Sunapee Lake station, but was solely upon the contract of carriage in interstate commerce.\n The supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, in deciding the case, held that the interstate commerce act did not in any wise change the common-law rule, applicable in Massachusetts, that regulations of this character, limiting the amount of recovery for baggage lost, must be brought home to the knowledge of the shipper and assented to, or circumstances shown from which assent might be implied. In reaching this conclusion that learned court relied upon the case of Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Hughes, \n191 U.S. 477\n, 48 L. ed. 268, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132, in which case it was held that a state might apply its local law and policy to recovery for the loss of a horse shipped in interstate commerce from Albany, New York, to Cynwyd, in the state of Pennsylvania, and injured by the negligence of a carrier in the latter state, notwithstanding the bill of lading contained an express condition that the carrier assumed liability to the extent only of the agreed valuation in event of loss. \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 110]\n\u00a0\n It was further held in the Hughes Case that the interstate commerce act, in the respect then under consideration, had not enacted an exclusive rule upon which recovery might be had governing responsibility for loss, and that as the law then stood the state might enforce its own regulations authorized by statute or judicial decision as to responsibility for such negligence.\n Since the decision in the Hughes Case the Hepburn act of June 29, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1288), has been passed, and this court has held that by virtue of that act ( particularly  7, the Carmack amendment) the subject of interstate transportation of property has been regulated by Federal law to the exclusion of the power of the states to control in such respect by their own policy or legislation. In this connection we may refer to the cases of Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 57 L. ed. 314, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148; Wells, F. & Co. v. Neiman-Marcus Co. \n227 U.S. 469\n, 57 L. ed. 600, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 267; Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, \n227 U.S. 639\n, 57 L. ed. 683, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 391; Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Harriman, \n227 U.S. 657\n, 57 L. ed. 690, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397.\n The cases in 226 and 227 U. S., it is true, involved liability for express or freight shipments made upon express receipts, bills of lading, or separate contracts, showing on their face or by reference to tariffs the opportunity for valuation for the purpose of fixing the rate and liability, and the limitation appearing in such form of contract was declared to be valid and effectual to relieve the carrier from a greater liability than that therein expressed. But the court did not stop there: In Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 509\n, 57 L. ed. 321, 44 L.R.A.(N. S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148, it said: 'The knowledge of the shipper that the rate was based upon the value is to be presumed from the terms of the bill of lading and of the published schedules filed with the Commission.' In Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, \n227 U.S. 652\n, 57 L. ed. 688, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 391, this court said: 'The valuation the shipper declares determines the legal rate where there are two rates based upon valuation. He must take notice of the rate applicable, \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 111]\n\u00a0\n and actual want of knowledge is no excuse. The rate, when made out and filed, is notice, and its effect is not lost, although it is not actually posted in the station. Texas & P. R. Co. v. Mugg, \n202 U.S. 242\n, 50 L. ed. 1011, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 628; Chicago & A. R. Co. v. Kirby, \n225 U.S. 155\n, 56 L. ed. 1033, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648. It would open a wide door to fraud and destroy the uniform operation of the published tariff rate sheets. When there are two published rates, based upon difference in value, the legal rate automatically attaches itself to the declared or agreed value. Neither the intentional nor accidental misstatement of the applicable published rate will bind the carrier or shipper. The lawful rate is that which the carrier must exact and that which the shipper must pay. . . . To the extent that such limitations of liability are not forbidden by law, they become, when filed, a part of the rate.' And in Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Harriman, \n227 U.S. 669\n, 57 L. ed. 697, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397, this court said that the shipper was compelled to take notice of the rate sheets contained in tariff schedules, 'not only because referred to in the contract signed by them, but because they had been lawfully filed and published. . . . When the carrier graduates its rates by value and has filed its tariffs showing two rates applicable to a particular commodity or class of articles, based upon a difference in valuation, the shipper must take notice, for the valuation automatically determines which of the rates is the lawful rate.' In Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Cramer, \n232 U.S. 490\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 383, this court said: 'That rule of liability [the uniform rule established by the Hepburn act] is to be enforced in the light of the fact that the provisions of the tariff enter into and form a part of the contract of shipment, and if a regularly filed tariff offers two rates, based on value, and the goods are forwarded at the low value in order to secure the low rate, then the carrier may avail itself of that valuation when sued for loss or damage to the property.' And in Great Northern R. Co. v. O'Connor, 232, \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 112]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 508, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 380, this court said: 'But so long as the tariff rate, based on value, remained operative, it was binding upon the shipper and carrier like, and was to be enforced by the courts in fixing the rights and liabilities of the parties. The tariffs are filed with the Commission and are open to inspection at every station. In view of the multitude of transactions, it is not necessary that there shall be an inquiry as to each article, or a distinct agreement as to the value of each shipment. If no value is stated, the tariff rate applicable to such a state of facts applies. If, on the other hand, there are alternative rates based on value, and the shipper names a value to secure the lower rate, the carrier, in the absence of something to show rebating or false billing, is entitled to collect the rate which applies to goods of that class, and if sued for their loss it is liable only for the loss of what the shipper had declared them to be in class and value.'\n Before these cases were decided this court had held that the effect of filing schedules of rates with the Interstate Commerce Commission was to make the published rates binding upon shipper and carrier alike, thus making effectual the purpose of the act to have but one rate, open to all alike, and from which there could be no departure. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Hefley, \n158 U.S. 98\n, 39 L. ed. 910, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 802; Texas & P. R. Co. v. Mugg, \n202 U.S. 242\n, 50 L. ed. 1011, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 628; Armour Packing Co. v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 56, 81\n, 52 S. L. ed. 681, 694, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 428; Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 \nU.S. 467, 476\n, 55 S. L. ed. 297, 301, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 671, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 265. This principle, it will be perceived, was fully recognized in the series of cases decided since the passage of the Hepburn act, beginning with the case of Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, supra. It is true that the Carmack amendment requires a receipt or bill of lading to be issued concerning shipments of property in interstate commerce, and that in the cases construing that amendment a bill of lading was issued, and according to the circumstances of the case, the bill of lading and its effect are discussed in each of these, but the \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 113]\n\u00a0\n effect of filing the schedule is not lost sight of, and the doctrine of the previous cases as to the purpose of filing and the necessity of adherence to such schedule is uniformly recognized.\n The court below, after conceding that the subject-matter of passenger's baggage in interstate travel is within the control of Congress, and saying that there was no specific regulation respecting it, said:\n'The precise position of the defendant is that, as the limitation of liability for baggage was filed and posted as a part of its schedules for passenger tariff, the limitation thereby became and was an essential part of its rate, from which, under the interstate commerce law, it could not deviate, and by which the plaintiff was bound, regardless of her knowledge of or assent to it. If the premise is sound, then the conclusion follows, for the public are held inexorably to the rate published, regardless of knowledge, assent, or even misrepresentation. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v.

Cas. 1912C, 727.\n\n It follows, therefore, from the previous decisions in this court, that if it be found that the limitation of liability for baggage is required to be filed in the carrier's tariffs, the plaintiff was bound by such limitation. Having the notice which follows from the filed and published regulations, as required by the statute and the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, she might have declared the value of her luggage, paid the excess tariff rate, and thus secured the liability of the carrier to the full amount of the value of her baggage, or she might, for the purpose of transportation, have valued it at $100, and received free transportation and liability to that extent only, or, as she did, she might have made no valuation of her baggage, in which event the rate and the corresponding liability would have automatically attached. As to the finding \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 114]\n\u00a0\n that the plaintiff's baggage was apparently worth more than $100, as above set forth, it appears that the contents of the two trunks and suit case were not disclosed or known to the carrier, and the finding in this respect, necessarily based on the appearance of the baggage, cannot be said to show a procurement of transportation in violation of the requirements of the filed schedules at a rate disproportionate to its known value.\n Let us now turn to the interstate commerce act and see whether the matter of the limitation of baggage liability is covered by that act. Section 6 provides:\n'That every common carrier subject to the provisions of this act shall file with the Commission created by this act, and print and keep open to public inspection, schedules showing all the rates, fares, and charges for transportation between different points on its own route and between points on its own route and points on the route of any other carrier by railroad, by pipe line, or by water when a through route and joint rate have been established. If no joint rate over the through route has been established, the several carriers in such through route shall file, print, and keep open to public inspection, as aforesaid, the separately established rates, fares, and charges applied to the through transportation. The schedules printed as aforesaid by and such common carrier shall plainly state the places between which property and passengers will be carried, and shall contain the classification of freight in force, and shall also state separately all terminal charges, storage charges, icing charges, and all other charges which the Commission may require, all privileges or facilities granted or allowed, and any rules or regulations which in anywise change, affect, or determine any part or the aggregate of such aforesaid rates, fares, and charges, or the value of the service rendered to the passenger, shipper, or \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 115]\n\u00a0\n consignee. Such schedules shall be plainly printed in large type, and copies for the use of the public shall be kept posted in two public and conspicuous places in every depot, station, or office of such carrier where passengers or freight, respectively, are received for transportation, in such form that they shall be accessible to the public, and can be conveniently inspected. The provisions of this section shall apply to all traffic, transportation, and facilities defined in this act.\n\n ... * *\n'No carrier, unless otherwise provided by this act, shall engage or participate in the transportation of passengers or property, as defined in this act, unless the rates, fares, and charges upon which the same are transported by said carrier have been filed and published in accordance with the provisions of this act; nor shall any carrier charge or demand or collect or receive a greater or less or different compensation for such transportation of passengers or property, or for any service in connection therewith, between the points named in such tariffs, than the rates, fares, and charges which are specified in the tariff filed and in effect at the time; nor shall any carrier refund or remit in any manner or by any device any portion of the rates, fares, and charges so specified, nor extend to any shipper or person any privileges or facilities in the transportation of passengers or property, except such as are specified in such tariffs . . . .' [24 Stat. at L. 380, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3156, as amended by  2 of act of 1906, 34 Stat. at L. 586, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1289.]\n\n It is to be observed that the schedules are required to state, among other things, in naming certain charges, 'all other charges which the Commission may require, all privileges or facilities granted or allowed, and any rules or regulations which in anywise change, affect, or determine any part or the aggregate of such aforesaid rates, fares, and charges, or the value of the service rendered to the passenger, shipper, or consignee.' The question then is, did the limitation as to liability for baggage, based \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 116]\n\u00a0\n upon the requirement to declare its value when more than $100 was to be recovered, come within that provision?\n It seems to us that the ordinary signification of the terms used in the act would cover such requirements as are here made for the amount of recovery for baggage lost by the carrier. It is a regulation which fixes and determines the amount to be charged for the carriage in view of the responsibility assumed, and it also affects the value of the service rendered to the passenger. Such requirements are spoken of, in decisions dealing with them, as regulations; as, a common carrier 'may prescribe regulations to protect himself against imposition and fraud, and fix a rate of charges proportionate to the magnitude of the risks he may have to encounter.' York Mfg. Co. v. Illinois C. R. Co. 3 Wall. 107, 112, 18 L. ed. 170, 171. 'It is undoubtedly competent for carriers of passengers, by specific regulations, distinctly brought to the knowledge of the passenger, which are reasonable in their character, and not inconsistent with any statute or their duties to the public, to protect themselves against liability, as insurers, for baggage exceeding a fixed amount in value, except upon additional compensation, proportioned to the risk. And in order that such regulations may be practically effective and the carrier advised of the full extent of its responsibility, and, consequently, of the degree of precaution necessary upon its part, it may rightfully require, as a condition precedent to any contract for the transportation of baggage, information from the passenger as to its value; and if the value thus disclosed exceeds that which the passenger may reasonably demand to be transported as baggage without extra compensation the carrier, at its option, can make such additional charges as the risk fairly justifies.' New York C. & H. R. R. Co. v. Fraloff, \n100 \nU.S. 24, 27\n, 25 S. L. ed. 531, 533.\n Mr. Justice Brewer, sitting in the circuit court, in Ames v. Union P. R. Co. 64 Fed. 165, 178, thus defined the term 'regulation:' 'Within the term 'regulation' \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 117]\n\u00a0\n are embraced two ideas; One is the mere control of the operation of the roads, prescribing the rules for the management thereof,-matters which affect the convenience of the public in their use. Regulation, in this sense, may be considered as purely public in its character, and in no manner trespassing upon the rights of the owners of railroads. But within the scope of the word 'regulation,' as commonly used, is embraced the idea of fixing the compensation which the owners of railroad property shall receive for the use thereof; and when regulation in this sense is attempted, it necessarily affects the property interests of the railroad owners; and it is 'regulation' in this sense of the term.'\n Turning to the act itself we think the conclusion that this limitation is a regulation required to be filed by the act is strengthened by  22, which provides: 'But before any common carrier, subject to the provisions of this act, shall issue any such joint interchangeable mileage tickets with special privileges, as aforesaid, it shall file with the Interstate Commerce Commission copies of the joint tariffs of rates, fares, or charges on which such joint interchangeable mileage tickets are to be based, together with specifications of the amount of free baggage permitted to be carried under such tickets, in the same manner as common carriers are required to do with regard to other joint rates by section six of this act.' [As amended 28 Stat. at. L. 643, chap. 61, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3171.] This section would indicate that Congress thought that  6 of the act had to do with specifications of the amount of baggage which would be carried free, and that such regulations should be filed under the requirement of  6 to which it referred.\n This conclusion is further strengthened by the action of the Interstate Commerce Commission, in requiring by its Tariff Circular No. 15- A, entitled, 'Regulations Governing the Construction and Filing of Freight Tariffs and Classi- \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 118]\n\u00a0\n fication and Passenger Fare Schedules,' effective April 15, 1908, and in force at the time of the loss here in question, that:\n'34. Tariffs shall contain, in the order named:\n\n'(g) Rules and regulations which govern the tariff, the title of each rule or regulation to be shown in bold type. Under this head all of the rules, regulations, or conditions which in any way affect the fares named in the tariff shall be entered. . . . These rules shall include . . . the general baggage regulations, and also schedule of excess-baggage rates, unless such excess-baggage rates are shown in tariff in connection with the fares.'\n\n This requirement is a practical interpretation of the law by the administrative body having its enforcement in charge, and is entitled to weight in construing the act.\n The act of June 18, 1910 (36 Stat. at L. 539, 546, chap. 309, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1288), defining, in  1, the duties of carriers to make just and reasonable regulations affecting, among other things, the carrying of personal, sample, and excess baggage, may be noted in passing. This statute was before the Commission in a case involving such regulations. Regulations Restricting the Dimensions of Baggage, 26 Inters. Com. Rep. 292. Concerning it the Commission, by Clark, Chairman, said:\n'Prior to June 18, 1910, the act to regulate late commerce contained no specific provision relating to the interstate transportation of baggage, except in connection with the issuance of joint interchangeable mileage tickets. The Commission had, however, under authority of  6, required carriers to publish and file their general baggage regulations and their schedules of excess baggage rates. Section 1 was amended on the date named, the amendment, in so far as it is material, reading as follows:\n\n\"It is hereby made the duty of all common carriers subject to the provisions of this act to establish, observe, \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 119]\n\u00a0\n and enforce . . . just and reasonable regulations and practices affecting classifications, . . . the manner and method of presenting, marking, packing, and delivering property for transportation, the facilities for transportation, . . . the carrying of personal, sample, and excess baggage.\"\n\n And it is to be observed that the Commission considers its requirement with reference to including baggage regulations in the tariff schedules, quoted above, as adequate, for the same provisions appear in its current circular.\n We are therefore of the opinion that the requirement published concerning the amount of the liability of the defendant, based upon additional payment where baggage was declared to exceed $100 in value, was determinative of the rate to be charged, and did affect the service to be rendered to the passenger, as it fixed the price to be paid for the service rendered in the particular case, and was, therefore, a regulation within the meaning of the statute.\n By permitting the baggage regulations, including the excess valuation rate, to be filed and become part of the tariff schedules, the rule of the common law that the carrier becomes an insurer of the safety of baggage against accidents not the act of God or the public enemy or the fault of the passenger (the rule established in this country, 3 Hutchinson, Carr.  1241) was not changed. The effect of such filing is to permit the carrier by such regulations to obtain commensurate compensation for the responsibility assumed for the safety of the passenger's baggage, and to require the passenger, whose knowledge of the character and value of his baggage is peculiarly his own, to declare its value and pay for the excess amount. There is no question of the reasonableness or propriety of making such regulations, which would be binding upon the passenger if brought to his knowledge in such wise as \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 120]\n\u00a0\n to make an agreement or what is tantamount thereto. This much is conceded by the learned counsel for the plaintiff in error. The liability of a carrier under the interstate commerce act was said, in the Croninger Case ( p. 511), to be (aside from the responsibility for the default of a connecting carrier) 'not beyond the liability imposed by the common law, as that body of law applicable to carriers has been interpreted by this court as well as many courts of the states.' And in that case (p. 509) it was laid down as the established rule of common law 'as declared by this court in many cases that such a carrier may by a fair, open, just, and reasonable agreement limit the amount recoverable by a shipper in case of loss or damage to an agreed value made for the purpose of obtaining the lower of two or more rates of charges proportioned to the amount of the risk.' And see the previous cases in this court there cited. But the effect of the regulations, filed as required, giving notice of rates based upon value when the baggage to be transported was of a higher value than $ 100, and the delivery and acceptance of the baggage without declaration of value or notice to the carrier of such higher value, charges the carrier with liability to the extent of $100 only.\n The language of the regulation filed reads: Baggage liability is limited to personal baggage not to exceed $100 in value, etc., unless a greater value is declared, etc. We have said that this limitation does not relieve from the insurer's liability when the loss occurs otherwise than by negligence, and we think applies equally when negligence of the carrier is the cause of loss, as is found in this case. The effect of the filing gives the regulation as to baggage the force of a contract determining 'Baggage liability.' In Hart v. Pennsylvania R. Co. \n112 U.S. 331\n, 28 L. ed. 717, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 151, followed in the later cases in this court, it was held that a recovery may not be had above the amount stipulated though the loss results from the carrier's negligence. 'The carrier \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 121]\n\u00a0\n must respond for negligence up to that value.' The discussion and conclusion reached in the Croninger and Carl Cases, supra, leave nothing to be said on this point. This rule is recognized in New York (Tewes v. North German Lloyd S. S. Co. 186 N. Y. 151, 8 L.R.A.(N.S.) 199, 78 N. E. 864, 9 Ann. Gas. 909, 20 Am. Neg. Rep. 701; Gardiner v. New York C. & H. R. R. Co. 201 N. Y. 387, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 826, 94 N. E. 876, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 281).\n If the charges filed were unreasonable, the only attack that could be made upon such regulation would be by proceedings contesting their reasonableness before the Interstate Commerce Commission. While they were in force they were equally binding upon the railroad company and all passengers whose baggage was transported by carriers in interstate commerce. This being the fact, we think the limitation of liability to $ 100 fixed the amount which the plaintiff could recover in this case, and there was error in affirming the recovery for the full value of the baggage, in the absence of a declaration of such value and payment of the additional amount required to secure liability in the greater sum.\n We do not think the requirement of the Carmack amendment, that a railway company receiving property for transportation in interstate commerce shall issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor, required other receipts than baggage checks, which it is shown were issued when the baggage was received in this case. When the amendment was passed Congress well knew that baggage was not carried upon bills of lading, and that carriers had been accustomed to issue checks upon receipt of baggage. We do not think it was intended to require a departure from this practice when the matter was placed under regulation by schedules filed and subject to change for unreasonableness upon application to the Commission. Such checks are receipts, and there is no special requirement in the statute as to their form. It is doubtless in the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to make requirements as to the checks or receipts to be given for baggage if that \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 122]\n\u00a0\n subject needs regulation. Act of June 18, 1910,  1 and 15 (36 Stat. at L. 539, chap. 309).\n Reversed and remanded to the Superior Court of Massachusetts for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney, dissenting:\n I have been unable to find a previous instance where any court, in this country, at least, in an action by shipper or passenger against common carrier for loss of freight or baggage, occasioned by the negligence of the carrier or its employees, has held the recovery to be limited to an arbitrary sum unrelated to the value of the goods lost, and this without any previous valuation or agreement assented to by the shipper or passenger, without any representation of value made by him, and without even notice brought home to him of any rule or regulation upon which the limitation of liability is based. The effect given by the present decision to a 'regulation' prescribed by the carrier, that, while formally promulgated, was in fact unknown to the passenger, seems to me an entire departure from the principles governing the duties and responsibilities of common carriers as heretofore recognized by this court and by the courts of the states generally, as laid down in the text-books and cyclopedias of law, and as reiterated and applied by this court in a recent series of notable decisions.\n We are referred to the 'act to regulate commerce' of February 4, 1887 ( 24 Stat. at L. 379, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3154), as amended in 1906 by the Hepburn act (34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1288), with citation of the provision in  6 of the act respecting the filing and publication of schedules showing the rates, fares, and charges for transportation, etc., and with particular emphasis upon the so-called Carmack amendment. I do not find in either of these any phrase or expression that manifests a legislative intent to lessen or limit in any way \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 123]\n\u00a0\n the carrier's liability as quasi insurer, much less its responsibility for losses due to its own negligence or that of its employees. Neither enactment in terms imposes any duty or burden upon the shipper or passenger affecting the question at issue; and the Carmack amendment, at least, contains a clear expression of the legislative purpose to enforce the carrier's responsibility for losses of property caused by it, without regard to any rule or regulation exempting it.\n The result reached in the present case-which seems so contrary to all previous adjudications and to the apparent meaning of the acts of Congress- is based (if I understand the opinion) not upon any legislation directly addressed to the particular subject, but upon inferences deduced by indirect reasoning from the assumed policy of the law. The reasoning, as I am constrained to believe, disregards familiar principles established by repeated decisions of this court, in the light of which Congress undoubtedly legislated; and it has the effect of placing honest but unskilled shippers and passengers at a serious disadvantage in dealing with common carriers, enabling the latter, by 'regulations' never called to the attention of the former, to obtain practical immunity from responsibility for losses due to their own negligence.\n The consequences are so serious that I have been unable to convince myself that I should acquiesce in silence.\n The salient facts are mentioned in the opinion, but some are not noticed, and it is proper to state that plaintiff traveled, in September, 1908, as an interstate passenger upon defendant's train from Boston, Massachusetts, to Sunapee Lake, New Hampshire, having in fact paid two first-class fares, one ticket being used for the checking of her baggage, the other for her personal transportation. Defendant's schedules, filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and published in the mode prescribed by the act of Congress, showed the rates of fares between \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 124]\n\u00a0\n these places, and contained a provision stating that 'one hundred and fifty pounds of personal baggage, not exceeding $100 in value, will be checked free for each passenger on presentation of a full ticket. . . . For excess weight, charge will be made as follows [here was inserted a table of charges for excess weights, and at the foot of it the following]: For excess value, the rate will be one half of the current excess baggage rate per 100 pounds for each $100, or fraction thereof, of increased value declared. The minimum charge for excess value will be 15 cents. Baggage liability is limited to personal baggage not to exceed $100 in value for a passenger presenting a full ticket . . . unless a greater value is declared and stipulated by the owner and excess charges thereon paid at time of checking the baggage.' Plaintiff's baggage consisted of three pieces, of the value of $1,904.50, and the charge on this valuation for transportation from Boston to Sunapee Lake, according to the schedules, would have been 25c. for each excess $100 or fraction thereof, or $4.75 in all. Plaintiff did not declare and stipulate at the time the baggage was checked that it exceeded $100 in value, and did not pay any charge for valuation in excess of that amount. Defendant's agents did not request any such declaration, and made no inquiry respecting value; but it is found as a fact that from the outward appearance of the baggage when tendered to defendant for transportation any reasonable person would have inferred that its value largely exceeded $100. There was nothing to show that any more expensive or different mode of transportation was adopted for baggage whose value was declared to exceed $100 than for other baggage. Nor was there anything to show that plaintiff, or her agent who attended to the checking of the baggage for her, had notice of defendant's regulations for limiting its liability. In the Boston passenger station notices were posted that 'Freight \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 125]\n\u00a0\n and passenger tariffs naming rates on interstate traffic are on file with the agent, and will be furnished for inspection upon application;' and in the baggage room was a notice that 'One hundred and fifty pounds of personal baggage, not exceeding $100 in value, will be checked free for each passenger on presentation of a full ticket.' There was nothing in either of these notices to call attention to any charge for excess value, nor any statement in terms that the baggage liability was limited to $100. Nor was it shown that the notices themselves were ever seen by plaintiff or her agent. It appears, however, that because the weight of her baggage exceeded by 45 pounds the weight allowable under the company's rules, a payment of 23 cents was made for checking the baggage. Ordinary numbered baggage checks appear to have been delivered to plaintiff's agent, but nothing else in the form of a receipt or bill of lading. The baggage was not lost in transit, but was destroyed by fire while in defendant's charge, more than twenty-six hours after its arrival at defendant's Sunapee Lake station. It was distinctly found as a fact that the loss was due to defendant's negligence.\n In the trial court, plaintiff relied wholly upon a count of her declaration which, after reciting the status of defendant as a common carrier, and the constract of carriage in interstate commerce, averred as ground of recovery the neglect and refusal of defendant to deliver the baggage to plaintiff at Sunapee Lake upon demand made, accompanied with a tender of the checks. But the course of the trial shows that negligence was a principal issue, if not the only vital issue; both parties requested findings upon the question, and findings were made in response to their respective requests; and upon review the state supreme court treated negligence as the asserted ground of liability, saying (209 Mass. 599, 95 N. E. 945, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 669): 'The plaintiff, an interstate passenger of the defendant, claims \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 126]\n\u00a0\n damages in excess of $2,000 for loss of her baggage occurring through the negligence of the defendant.'\n Although, according to the well-known Massachusetts doctrine, the railroad company's responsibility strictly as carrier would seem to have terminated with the completion of the transit and the safe deposit of the baggage in the railroad station, its responsibility thereafter being that of warehouseman (Thomas v. Boston & P. R. Corp. 10 Met. 472, 477, 43 Am. Dec. 444; Norway Plains Co. v. Boston & M. R. Co. 1 Gray, 263, 273, 61 Am. Dec. 423; Barron v. Eldredge, 100 Mass. 455, 459, 1 Am. Rep. 126; Lane v. Boston & A. R. Co. 112 Mass. 455, 462; Stowe v. New York, B. & P. R. Co. 113 Mass. 521, 523; Rice v. Hart, 118 Mass. 201, 207, 19 Am. Rep. 433), the distinction appears to have been ignored by the Massachusetts court in discussing the case, perhaps because it does not affect the responsibility for loss of goods attributable to negligence; there being in this respect no difference between a carrier and a warehouseman. But it might affect the question whether defendant's responsibility is to be determined in the light of the interstate commerce act; and I concede that it is.\n It is, of course, true that in Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 57 L. ed. 314, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148, this court held that by the Carmack amendment (34 Stat. at L. 595, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1307, set forth in the margin ) the\n That any common carrier, railroad, or transportation company receiving property for transportation from a point in one state to a point in another state shall issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor, and shall be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss, damage, or injury to such property caused by it or by any common carrier, railroad, or transportation company to which such property may be delivered, or over whose line or lines such property may pass, and no contract, receipt, rule, or regulation shall exempt such common carrier, railroad, or transportation company from the liability hereby imposed: Provided, that nothing in this section shall deprive any holder of such receipt or bill of lading of any remedy or right of action which he has under existing law.' \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 127]\n\u00a0\n subject-matter of the liability of railroads under bills of lading issued for interstate freight is placed under Federal regulation so as to supersede the local law and policy of the several states, whether evidenced by judicial decision, by statute, or by state Constitution.\n And I concede that the supreme court of Massachusetts erred if it intended to hold that the carrier's responsibility for interstate passengers' baggage is not likewise within the sweep of the amendment.\n The concrete question, therefore, is whether, under the interstate commerce act and the Carmack amendment, this defendant's liability to plaintiff, upon the facts stated, is properly to be limited to $100.\n My views, in brief, are:\n\n\n (a)\n That the baggage regulation limiting the liability to the amount named (if construed as operative without the knowledge or consent of the passenger, and in the absence of an actual valuation of the goods, assented to by the passenger), is not authorized or sanctioned by the commerce act, and is invalid because contrary to the established policy of the law governing the common carrier in the performance of its public duties, and because contrary to the letter and spirit of the Carmack amendment.\n\n\n (b)\n That the regulation had not received the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission, but, on the contrary, was covered by an adverse administrative ruling made by the Commission a few months before the occurrences that gave rise to this action.\n\n\n (c)\n That, being invalid per se, the regulation derived no legal force or vitality from being included in the filed and published schedules.\n\n\n (d)\n That the filing of the regulation cannot give it the force of a contract, because (1) plaintiff was ignorant of the regulation in fact; (2) to make it a part of her contract without her knowledge would render it a contract limiting \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 128]\n\u00a0\n the carrier's liability for negligence to an arbitrary sum, without any agreement or representation of value on the part of plaintiff, and therefore void as being contrary to the established public policy, and (3) the law will not raise by implication an agreement that is contrary to the policy of the law.\n\n\n (e)\n That plaintiff is not estopped to recover the full value of her goods, for she was entirely free from blame in the matter, made no representation as to value, and sought no special advantage.\n\n\n (f)\n That even were the contract of carriage as actually made invalid, this would not render the bailment unlawful, and (at least) the carrier would be responsible for the loss of the goods through negligence, irrespective of the contract.\n\n\n (g)\n That by the terms of the Carmack amendment the railroad company in this case is precluded from setting up a limitation of liability, (1) because the limitation as asserted against a passenger who was ignorant of the regulation, and had made no contract under it, amounts to a rule or regulation for exempting the carrier from liability for a loss of property caused by the carrier's negligence, contrary to the terms to the amendment; and (2) because the carrier waived any benefit of the regulation (if that were valid) by failing to deliver to plaintiff a receipt or bill of lading embodying the terms of the contract as required by the same enactment.\n The importance of the subject seems to warrant a somewhat extended discussion.\n\n\n (1)\n Reference is made to  6 of the commerce act as amended by the Hepburn act: the portion relied upon being that which requires the filed and published schedules to state 'any rules or regulations which in anywise change, affect, or determine any part or the aggregate of such aforesaid rates, fares, and charges, or the value of the service rendered to the passenger, shipper, or* con- \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 129]\n\u00a0\n signee.' In this respect the act has remained substantially unchanged since the amendment of March 2, 1889 (25 Stat. at L. 855, chap. 382, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3158), quoted in the margin. \n It is important to observe that  6, either before or since the Hepburn act, does not prescribe what the rules and regulations shall be. Neither this section nor any other section of the act confers upon the carrier any authority over the subject. It is implied that there may be, indeed must be, rules and regulations for carrying on the business of a common carrier, in order to secure system, efficiency, and a just performance of its public duties; and  6, recognizing this, prescribes- and, as I think, only prescribes-that whatever rules and regulation may be duly established which 'in anywise change, affect, or determine the rates, fares, and charges, or the value of the\n'Sec. 6. That every common carrier subject to the provisions of this act shall print and keep open to public inspection schedules showing the rates and fares and charges for the transportation of passengers and property which any such common carrier has established and which are in force at the time upon its route. The schedules printed as aforesaid by any such common carrier shall plainly state the places upon its railroad between which property and passengers will be carried, and shall contain the classification of freight in force, and shall also state separactely the terminal charges and any rules or regulations which in anywise change, affect, or determine any part or the aggregate of such aforesaid rates and fares and charges. Such schedules shall be plainly printed in large type, and copies for the use of the public shall be posted in two public and conspicuous places in every depot, station, or office of such carrier where passengers or freight, respectively, are received for transportation, in such form that they shall be accessible to the public and can be conveniently inspected. . . . And when any such common carrier shall have established and published its rates, fares, and charges in compliance with the provisions of this section, it shall be unlawful for such common carrier to charge, demand, collect, or receive from any person or persons a greater or less compensation for the transportation of passengers or property, or for any services in connection therewith, than is specified in such published schedule of rates, fares, and charges as may at the time be in force.' \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 130]\n\u00a0\n service rendered,' shall be included in the filed and published schedules. But does it follow from this that the carrier may make any rules and regulations it chooses? Is the carrier to be a law unto itself? And, if not, what are the limitations upon its power? The answer, I think, is plain. The authority to establish rules and regulations, unless it arise from express legislative authority, is derived by implication from the necessities of the case, in view of the nature of the business, and is plainly subject to the limitation that the rules and regulations shall not be such as to contravene the letter or the policy of the law, nor such as to evade responsibility for the due performance of the public duties of the carrier.\n\n This is a principle universally recognized from an early day by the courts of this country, and it lies at the foundation of the rule everywhere prevalent (differing, in this regard, from the rule that prevailed in England for a time prior to the railway and canal traffic act 1854, 17 and 18 Vict. chap. 31,  7), that the carrier cannot limit his liability by any general regulation or published notice.\n It is for this reason, primarily, that the regulation here in question,-'Baggage liability is limited to personal baggage not to exceed $ 100 in value . . . unless a greater value is declared,' etc., if treated as intended to be effective without the knowledge or assent of the passenger, seems to me to be a regulation entirely beyond the power of the carrier to establish. The state reports are full of cases recognizing the principle, and applying and enforcing it with respect to the particular subject-matter now under consideration. It is not necessary, however, to go outside of our own reports, for this court from the beginning until now has constantly recognized and steadfastly enforced this limitation of the authority of the common carrier with respect to regulations of the same essential character as the one now in question. \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 131]\n\u00a0\n Thus, in New Jersey Steam Nav. Co. v. Merchants' Bank, 6 How. 344, 382, 12 L. ed. 465, 482, the court held that the carrier could not by published notices seeking to limit its responsibility exonerate itself from the duties which the law annexed to its employment. And, dealing with an express stipulation, the court, by Mr. Justice Nelson (p. 382), said: 'But admitting the right thus to restrict his obligation, it by no means follows that he can do so by any act of his own. He is in the exercise of a sort of public office, and has public duties to perform, from which he should not be permitted to exonerate himself without the assent of the parties concerned. And this is not to be implied or inferred from a general notice to the public, limiting his obligation, which may or may not be assented to. He is bound to receive and carry all the goods offered for transportation, subject to all the responsibilities incident to his employment, and is liable to an action in case of refusal. And we agree with the court in the case of Hollister v. Nowlen, 19 Wend. 234, 247, 32 Am. Dec. 455, that, if any implication is to be indulged from the delivery of the goods under the general notice, it is as strong that the owner intended to insist upon his rights and the duties of the carrier, as it is that he assented to their qualification. The burden of proof lies on the carrier, and nothing short of an express stipulation by parol or in writing should be permitted to discharge him from duties which the law has annexed to his employment.'\n In York Mfg. Co. v. Illinois C. R. Co. 3 Wall. 107, 112, 18 L. ed. 170, 171, the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Field, said: 'The law prescribes the duties and responsibilities of the common carrier. He exercises, in one sense, a public employment, and has duties to the public to perform. Though he may . . . prescribe regulations to protect himself against imposition and fraud, and fix a rate of charges proportionate to the magnitude of the risks he may have to encounter, he can make no discrimination between persons, or vary his charges from their condition or charac- \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 132]\n\u00a0\n ter. He is bound to accept all goods offered within the course of his employment, and is liable to an action in case of refusal. He is chargeable for all losses except such as may be occasioned by the act of God or the public enemy. He insures against all accidents which result from human agency, although occurring without any fault or neglect on his part; and he cannot by any mere act of his own avoid the responsibility which the law thus imposes. He cannot screen himself from liability by any general or special notice, nor can he coerce the owner to yield assent to a limitation of responsibility by making exorbitant charges when such assent is refused. The owner of the goods may rely upon this responsibility imposed by the common law, which can only be restricted and qualified when he expressly stipulates for the restriction and qualification. But when such stipulation is made, and it does not cover losses from negligence or misconduct, we can perceive no just reason for refusing its recognition and enforcement.'\n In Michigan C. R. Co. v. Mineral Springs Mfg. Co. 16 Wall. 318, 329, 21 L. ed. 297, 302, the court, after repeating the language I have quoted from the opinion in 6 How., proceeded to say: 'These considerations against the relaxation of the common-law responsibility by public advertisements apply with equal force to notices having the same object, attached to receipts given by carriers on taking the property of those who employ them into their possession for transportation. Both are attempts to obtain, by indirection, exemption from burdens imposed in the interests of trade upon this particular business. It is not only against the policy of the law, but a serious injury to commerce, to allow the carrier to say that the shipper of merchandise assents to the terms proposed in a notice, whether it be general to the public or special to a particular person, merely because he does not expressly dissent from them. If the parties were on an equality in their dealings with each other there might be some show of reason for assuming acquiescence from silence, but in \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 133]\n\u00a0\n the nature of the case this equality does not exist, and, therefore, every intendment should be made in favor of the shipper when he takes a receipt for his property, with restrictive conditions annexed, and says nothing, that he intends to rely upon the law for the security of his rights. It can readily be seen, if the carrier can reduce his liability in the way proposed, he can transact business on any terms he chooses to prescribe . . . . The law, in conceding to carriers the ability to obtain any reasonable qualification of their responsibility by express contract, has gone as far in this direction as public policy will allow.'\n So, in New York C. & H. R. R. Co. v. Fraloff, \n100 \nU.S. 24, 27\n, 25 S. L. ed. 531, 533, the court said: 'It is undoubtedly competent for carriers of passengers, by specific regulations, distinctly brought to the knowledge of the passenger, which are reasonable in their character, and not inconsistent with any statute or their duties to the public, to protect themselves against liability as insurers, for baggage exceeding a fixed amount in value, except upon additional compensation, proportioned to the risk. And in order that such regulations may be practically effective, and the carrier advised of the full extent of its responsibility, and, consequently, of the degree of precaution necessary upon its part, it may rightfully require, as a condition precedent to any contract for the transportation of baggage, information from the passenger as to its value; and if the value thus disclosed exceeds that which the passenger may reasonably demand to be transported as baggage without extra compensation, the carrier, at its option, can make such additional charge as the risk fairly justifies.'\n\n\n (2)\n And if it is against the policy of the law for a common carrier to limit its 'common-law liability'-that of quasi insurer of goods-by general regulation or published notice not assented to by the passenger or shipper, this is more emphatically true with respect to its responsibility for losses due to the negligence of the carrier or of its servants; for, even by express contract, upon whatever \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 134]\n\u00a0\n consideration, the carrier is not permitted to obtain exemption from liability for negligence. New Jersey Steam Nav. Co. v. Merchants' Bank, 6 How. 344, 383, 12 L. ed. 465, 482; York Mfg. Co. v. Illinois C. R. Co. 3 Wall. 107, 113, 18 L. ed. 170, 172; New York C. R. Co. v. Lockwood, 17 Wall. 357, 375, 384, 21 L. ed. 627, 638, 641, 10 Am. Neg. Cas. 624; Bank of Kentucky v. Adams Exp. Co. \n93 \nU.S. 174, 183\n, 23 S. L. ed. 872, 876.\n The rule admits of but one exception, and that is hedged with important qualifications. It is, that where a contract of carriage is fairly made between shipper and carrier agreeing upon a valuation of the property carried, or based upon a valuation declared by the shipper and relied on by the carrier, with a rate of freight based upon a condition limiting the carrier's liability to the amount of the agreed or declared valuation, and the valuation is in good faith relied upon by the carrier, and is not a mere cover for an attempt by the carrier to escape liability for negligence, the contract will be recognized as a proper mode of securing a due proportion between the amount for which the carrier is responsible and the freight he receives, and the shipper will be estopped from claiming more than the agreed or declared valuation, even in case of a loss due to negligence. So it was laid down by this court in Hart v. Pennsylvania R. Co. \n112 \nU.S. 331, 338\n, 28 S. L. ed. 717, 720, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 151, and the grounds of decision were expressed in the opinion of the court (by Mr. Justice Blatchford) in terms so clear that besides being uniformly followed by this court until now, they have been adopted generally by states that adhere to the common-law rules of liability. To quote from the opinion (\n112 U.S. 340\n): 'As a general rule, and in the absence of fraud or imposition, a common carrier is answerable for the loss of a package of goods though he is ignorant of its contents, and though its contents are ever so valuable, if he does not make a special acceptance. This is reasonable, because he can always guard himself by a special acceptance, or by insisting on being informed of the nature and value of the articles before receiving them. \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 135]\n\u00a0\n If the shipper is guilty of fraud or imposition, by misrepresenting the nature or value of the articles, he destroys his claim to indemnity, because he has attempted to deprive the carrier of the right to be compensated in proportion to the value of the articles and the consequent risk assumed, and what he has done has tended to lessen the vigilance the carrier would otherwise have bestowed [citing cases]. This qualification of the liability of the carrier is reasonable, and is as important as the rule which it qualifies. There is no justice in allowing the shipper to be paid a large value for an article which he has induced the carrier to take at a low rate of freight on the assertion and agreement that its value is a less sum than that claimed after a loss. It is just to hold the shipper to his agreement, fairly made, as to value, even where the loss or injury has occurred through the negligence of the carrier. The effect of the agreement is to cheapen the freight and secure the carriage, if there is no loss; and the effect of disregarding the agreement, after a loss, is to expose the carrier to a greater risk than the parties intended he should assume. The agreement as to value, in this case, stands as if the carrier had asked the value of the horses, and had been told by the plaintiff the sum inserted in the contract. The limitation as to value has no tendency to exempt from liability for negligence. It does not induce want of care. It exacts from the carrier the measure of care due to the value agreed on. The carrier is bound to respond in that value for negligence. The compensation for carriage is based on that value. The shipper is estopped from saying that the value is greater.'\n\n\n (3)\n Such was the state of the common law of this country, as universally recognized, when the interstate commerce act was passed, and I am unable to see in  6, or elsewhere in that act, any purpose to change it. During the entire time that intervened between the passage of the act and the passage of the Hepburn act (including the Carmack amendment) in 1906, the courts of the states \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 136]\n\u00a0\n (except in the few states that adopted a policy less favorable to the carrier) and the Federal courts generally administered the law as before, and without a suggestion, so far as I have observed, that  6, in requiring that all rules and regulations having a bearing upon rates should be filed and published, had in any way authorized common carriers by any mere rule or regulation, although properly promulgated, to limit the liability for damages by negligence in the absence of an express agreement as to value assented to by the shipper, or some representation of value made by him.\n Indeed, this court, in the recent case of Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Hughes, \n191 \nU.S. 477, 488\n, 48 S. L. ed. 268, 272, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132, held that  6, as it stood after the amendment of March 2, 1889, and before the Hepburn act, did not amount to a regulation of the matter of a limitation of the carrier's liability to a particular sum in consideration of lower freight rates for transportation. To quote from the opinion (pp. 487, 488): 'It may be assumed that under the broad power conferred upon Congress over interstate commerce as defined in repeated decisions of this court, it would be lawful for that body to make provision as to contracts for interstate carriage, permitting the carrier to limit its liability to a particular sum in consideration of lower freight rates for transportation. But upon examination of the terms of the law relied upon we fail to find any such provision therein. The sections of the interstate commerce law relied upon by the learned counsel for plaintiff in error, 24 Stat. at L. 379, 382, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3154; 25 Stat. at L. 855, chap. 382, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3158, provide for equal facilities to shippers for the interchange of traffic; for nondiscrimination in freight rates: for keeping schedules of rates open to public inspection; for posting the same in public places, with certain particulars as to charges, rules, and regulations; . . . giving remedies for the enforcement of the foregoing provisions, and providing penalties for their violation . . . . While under these provisions it may be said that Congress \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 137]\n\u00a0\n has made it obligatory to provide proper facilities for interstate carriage of freight, and has prevented carriers from obstructing continuous shipments on interstate lines, we look in vain for any regulation of the matter here in controversy. There is no sanction of agreements of this character limiting liability to stipulated valuations, and, until Congress shall legislate upon it, is there any valid objection to the state enforcing its own regulations upon the subject, although it may to this extent indirectly affect interstate-commerce contracts of carriage?'\n This query was by the decision answered in the negative. And as a result, notwithstanding  6 of the commerce act, the courts of Pennsylvania were left free to disregard the rule laid down in Hart v. Pennsylvania R. Co. and to follow their own declared doctrine denying the right of a common carrier to limit its liability for losses due to negligence, even by a special agreement including a valuation assented to by the shipper. In this respect the situation was changed by the Carmack amendment to the Hepburn act, but not (so far as I can see) by any of the changes made in  6 by that act.\n\n\n (4)\n And I had supposed that since as before the Carmack amendment, under the decisions of this court in Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 57 L. ed. 314, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148, and the other cases that have followed it along the same line, the general rules of law that disabled the common carrier from establishing regulations for limiting its liability by general notice not brought home to the shipper, and debarred the carrier from limiting its liability for losses due to negligence except by a special agreement including a fair valuation assented to by the shipper, had remained in full force and vigor, and indeed, by the effect of the amendment, had been made the exclusive rule of conduct for interstate carriers by rail. For the Croninger Case not only held (negatively) that the amendment superseded state laws upon the subject, but (affirmatively) \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 138]\n\u00a0\n that in matters not covered by its own express terms it had the effect of establishing the common-law rules respecting the carrier's liability, as laid down in previous decisions of this court, and adopted generally by the Federal courts. To quote from the opinion (p. 504): 'Prior to that amendment the rule of carrier's liability, for an interstate shipment of property, as enforced in both Federal and state courts, was either that of the general common law as declared by this court and enforced in the Federal courts throughout the United States (Hart v. Pennsylvania R. Co. \n112 U.S. 331\n, 28 L. ed. 717, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 151), or that determined by the supposed public policy of a particular state (Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Hughes, \n191 U.S. 477\n, 48 L. ed. 268, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132), or that prescribed by statute law of a particular state (Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Solan, \n169 U.S. 133\n, 42 L. ed. 688, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 289). Neither uniformity of obligation nor of liability was possible until Congress should deal with the subject' (Page 505): 'That the legislation supersedes all the regulations and policies of a particular state upon the same subject results from its general character. It embraces the subject of the liability of the carrier under a bill of lading which he must issue, and limits his power to exempt himself by rule, regulation, or contract. Almost every detail of the subject is covered so completely that there can be no rational doubt but that Congress intended to take possession of the subject and supersede all state regulation with reference to it.' (Page 507): 'But it has been argued that the nonexclusive character of this regulation is manifested by the proviso of the section, and that state legislation upon the same subject is not superseded, and that the holder of any such bill of lading may resort to any right of action against such a carrier conferred by existing state law. This view is untenable. It would result in the nullification of the regulation of a national subject and operate to maintain the confusion of the diverse regulation which it was the purpose of Congress \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 139]\n\u00a0\n to put an end to. . . . To construe this proviso as preserving to the holder of any such bill of lading any right or remedy which he may have had under existing Federal law at the time of his action gives to it a more rational interpretation than one which would preserve rights and remedies under existing state laws, for the latter view would cause the proviso to destroy the act itself.'\n It was upon this construction of the act that we proceeded to determine the validity of the provision in the receipt or bill of lading there in question, which limited the liability of the carrier to the agreed value of $50; and we applied thereto the familiar rules to which I have already referred. Thus (p. 509): 'That a common carrier cannot exempt himself from liability for his own negligence or that of his servants is elementary. York Mfg. Co. v. Illinois C. R. Co. 3 Wall. 107, 18 L. ed. 170; New York C. R. Co. v. Lockwood, 17 Wall. 357, 21 L. ed. 627, 10 Am. Neg. Cas. 624; Bank of Kentucky v. Adams Exp. Co. \n93 U.S. 174\n, 23 L. ed. 872; Hart v. Pennsylvania R. Co. \n112 \nU.S. 331, 338\n, 28 S. L. ed. 717, 720, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 151. The rule of the common law did not limit his liability to loss and damage due to his own negligence, or that of his servants. That rule went beyond this, and he was liable for any loss or damage which resulted from human agency, or any cause not the act of God or the public enemy. But the rigor of this liability might be modified through any fair, reasonable, and just agreement with the shipper which did not include exemption against the negligence of the carrier or his servants. The inherent right to receive a compensation commensurate with the risk involved the right to protect himself from fraud and imposition by reasonable rules and regulations, and the right to agree upon a rate proportionate to the value of the property transported. It has therefore become an established rule of the common law as declared by this court in many cases that such a carrier may by a fair, open, just, and reasonable agreement limit the amount recoverable by a shipper in case of loss or damage to an agreed value made for the \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 140]\n\u00a0\n purpose of obtaining the lower of two or more rates of charges proportioned to the amount of the risk.'\n The other decisions that have followed the Croninger Case (Chicago, B . & Q. R. Co. v. Miller, \n226 U.S. 513\n, 57 L. ed. 323, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 155; Chicago, St. P. M. & O. R. Co. v. Latta, \n226 U.S. 519\n, 57 L. ed. 328, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 155; Wells, F. & Co. v. Neiman-Marcus Co. \n227 U.S. 469\n, 57 L. ed. 600, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 267; Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, \n227 U.S. 639\n, 57 L. ed. 683, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 391; Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Harriman, \n227 U.S. 657\n, 57 L. ed. 690, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397; Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Cramer, \n232 U.S. 490\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 383; Great Northern R. Co. v. O'Connor, \n232 U.S. 508\n, 58 L. ed . --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 380) have simply applied the doctrine therein laid down, under varying circumstances.\n In each of these cases there was a special contract, held by the court to have been fairly made, and to amount to a valuation by the shipper of the goods in question for the purposes of the shipment. In short, the court in each instance applied the rule of liability laid down in Hart v. Pennsylvania R. Co. supra.\n\n\n (5)\n Because of this firmly established policy of the law respecting the carrier's responsibility for the consequences of his negligence, I should have construed the 'regulation' in question, limiting the baggage liability to $100, in subordination to that policy. According to the canon uniformly applied in construing statutes, that of giving them no meaning beyond that which the legislature may constitutionally enact, I should have construed the baggage regulation as a formula for standardizing the contracts proposed to be made by the carrier with the assent of passengers; not that the formula of itself constituted a substitute for a contract, or was intended to become binding upon the passenger until directly brought to his notice and in some way consciously assented to by him.\n But my brethren construe it as binding in the absence of any knowledge or assent on the part of the passenger. So considered, I deem it void as being a regulation that it was beyond the power of the common carrier to adopt. And if I am right about this, the fact that it was included \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 141]\n\u00a0\n in the filed and published schedules does not in the least add to its efficacy.\n It is not a question of mere unreasonableness. A carrier may resort to practices that are so clearly unwarranted by law as to require no preliminary application to the Commission, and that not even the sanction of the Commission could validate. I think the attempt to enforce, ex parte, such a limitation of liability, is in that category.\n\n\n (6)\n But, in fact, the Commission had an attempt to limit the carrier's liability regulation in question, construed as the court now construes it; and had done this prior to the time this action arose.\n I find nothing savoring of approval in 34(g) of Tariff Circular No. 15A, effective April 15, 1908. The reference to 'excess-baggage rates' is to charges for excess weight, as I think sufficiently appears from 26 Inters. Com. Rep. 292. But, if intended to apply to excess value, it does not suggest that a limitation of liability for losses attributable to negligence, effective without the knowledge or consent of the passenger, is to be made a part of such regulations.\n And in Re Released Rates, 13 Inters. Com. Rep. 550, decided May 14, 1908, the Commission, after full hearing and consideration, made an administrative interpretation of the Carmack amendment, holding distinctly that it did not abrogate the law of the Lockwood Case, 17 Wall. 357, 21 L. ed. 627, 10 Am. Neg. Cas. 624, and the Hart Case, \n112 U.S. 331\n, 28 L. ed. 717, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 151. Among other rules laid down (Mr. Commissioner Lane writing) were these (p. 553): '(b) When the shipper has placed upon his goods a specific value, the carrier accepting the same in good faith as their real value, the rate of freight being fixed in accordance therewith, the shipper cannot recover an amount in excess of the value he has disclosed, even when loss is caused by the carrier's negligence' [ citing the Hart Case, and quoting in italics from the opinion to the effect that under the circumstances disclosed 'the shipper is estopped \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 142]\n\u00a0\n from saying that the value is greater']. And again (p. 554): 'The same principle is applicable when the shipper has in some other way concealed the nature or the value of his goods in order to secure a lower rate of freight. . . . It does not appear that this principle is in any respect in derogation of the provisions of  20 [meaning the Carmack amendment]. The carrier is made liable 'for any loss, damage, or injury,' and 'no contract, receipt, rule, or regulation shall exempt such common carrier, railroad or transportation company from the liability hereby imposed.' But it is of the highest importance to note that this limitation is not secured by contract or notice-the contract has no validity per se. It is only right that a carrier who has acted in good faith should be protected against the frauds and misrepresentations of the shipper, and the law accomplishes this through the operation of the principle of estoppel. The shipper is estopped from recovering an amount in excess of the declared value, and the rule is in perfect harmony with the law as it stands to-day. 6 Cyc. title 'Carriers,' p. 401, note 5. (c) If the specified amount does not purport to be an agreed valuation, but represents an attempt on the part of the carrier to limit the amount of recovery to a fixed sum, irrespective of the actual value, the stipulation is void as against loss due to the carrier's negligence or other misconduct. Much confusion has arisen from failure to distinguish between this situation and the situation comprehended in Hart v. Pennsylvania R. Co. supra. That decision was expressly predicated upon the principle of estoppel; the shipper had misrepresented the value of his property, and had thereby secured the benefit of a lower rate than he was properly entitled to by virtue of the real value. He was estopped by his fraudulent conduct from recovering an amount in excess of the value he had declared. In the case we are now considering, the requisites of estoppel are wanting. An estoppel cannot \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 143]\n\u00a0\n arise unless the party invoking it has been the victim of misrepresentation, and has himself acted in good faith. Can it possibly be argued that when a carrier has arbitrarily placed in its bill of lading a stipulation limiting the amount of its liability, regardless of the actual value of the property, it may claim the benefit of an estoppel? Obviously not; it has not acted in good faith, neither has it been the victim of misrepresentation.' And again (p. 556): '(d) If the specified amount, while purporting to be an agreed valuation, is in fact purely fictitious, and represents an attempt to limit the carrier's liability to an arbitrary amount, liability for the full value cannot be escaped in event of loss due to negligence. This situation is substantially identical with that just considered,-the difference is one in form only.'\n\n\n (7)\n In the Hart Case, \n112 U.S. 331\n, 28 L. ed. 717, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 151, the fundamental ground of decision, as appears from what has been quoted from the opinion, was that since the shipper had entered into a special agreement for the purpose of cheapening the freight, he was estopped from saying that the value of the goods was greater than the value represented by him for the purposes of the agreement. So, also, in the Croninger Case, and the other recent cases referred to, estoppel was the ground of decision, as the opinions clearly show (226 U. S. p. 510, bottom; 227 U. S. p. 476, top; 227 U. S. p. 651, top; 227 U. S. p. 668, bottom). When participating in these decisions, I, for one, so understood them. In each case the principle of estoppel is essential to the reasoning. In the Carl Case, \n227 U.S. 651\n, 57 L. ed. 688, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 391, it was said: 'When a shipper delivers a package for shipment and declares a value, either upon request or voluntarily, and the carrier makes a rate accordingly, the shipper is estopped upon plain principles of justice from recovering, in case of loss or damage, any greater amount. The same principle applies if the value be declared in the form of a contract. If such a valuation be made in good faith for \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 144]\n\u00a0\n the purpose of obtaining the lower rate applicable to a shipment of the declared value, there is no exemption from carrier liability due to negligence forbidden by the statute when the shipper is limited to a recovery of the value so declared. The ground upon which such a declared or agreed value is upheld is that of estoppel' [citing the Hart Case upon this precise point]. And in the Harriman Case (\n227 U.S. 668\n, 57 L. ed. 696, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397), the topic is summed up as follows: 'The ground upon which the shipper is limited to the valuation declared is that of estoppel, and presupposes the valuation to be one made for the purpose of applying the lower of two rates based upon the value of the cattle. This whole matter has been so fully considered in Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 57 L. ed. 314, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148, and Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, supra, that we only need to refer to the opinions in those cases without further elaboration.'\n That these decisions are inconsistent with the theory that the mere act of including the regulations upon the subject in the filed schedules would operate to limit the liability of the carrier, without any representation or agreement as to value, assented to by the shipper, seems to me equally clear. Although in each case the relation of the rate differential to the question of valuation was brought home to the shipper, so that it appeared that the shipper had actual notice of the regulation upon the subject contained in the filed and published schedules, it was not suggested that the mere existence of such a regulation, coupled with the fact that the shipment was made at the more advantageous freight rate, had the effect of limiting the liability of the carrier in the event of a loss attributable to negligence. On the contrary, while the relation of the rate differential to the valuation was discussed, it was treated as merely showing that there was consideration for the agreement made by the shipper limiting the responsibility of the carrier, and as showing \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 145]\n\u00a0\n the reasonableness of that agreement and the grounds of the estoppel that grew out of it. It was in each case plainly implied, if not expressed, that some representation or valuation, consciously assented to by the shipper, was essential to the limitation of the carrier's liability.\n In the present case there is no ground for an estoppel against the plaintiff. She made no representation of any kind, her silence being attributable to her ignorance of the existence of the baggage regulation. No estoppel arises where the conduct of the party sought to be estopped is due to ignorance founded upon an innocent mistake; and the same is more evidently true when the innocent party is silent because not asked to speak, and unaware that there is occasion-much less, duty-to speak. There is, I think, no support in reason or authority for holding that a person acting in good faith, but in ignorance of his rights or of the rights of the other party, should be estopped on the ground of knowledge imputed to him by a mere fiction of the law. It is only when good faith requires one to speak that silence estops him; and in the findings of fact in this case there is not the slightest ground to attribute to the plaintiff any want of good faith. Estoppel in pais presupposes an actual fault or a culpable silence. Merchants' Nat. Bank v. State Nat. Bank, 10 Wall. 604, 605, 19 L. ed. 1008; Morgan v. Chicago & A. R. Co. \n96 \nU.S. 716, 720\n, 24 S. L. ed. 743, 744.\n And it seems sufficiently obvious that the railroad company did not in anywise rely upon plaintiff's silence to its disadvantage. There would, I think, be more reason for holding the company itself estopped, because it, and not the plaintiff, had knowledge of the baggage regulation; and, according to the findings, it was charged with notice that the baggage was worth much more than $100; and the circumstances appearing from the facts as found clearly indicate that plaintiff, through her agent, in effect tendered herself ready and willing to pay for her fare and baggage charges whatever was proper under the \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 146]\n\u00a0\n circumstances; and the company set its own price for the service it was to render.\n When the carrier was thus applied to by one of the traveling public for the performance of a transportation service in the line of its public duty, without any intimation that anything less than the full measure of the carrier's responsibility would be accepted, it was the carrier's duty, I think, according to principles hitherto recognized, to quote a rate commensurate with the service demanded, including an unlimited responsibility where nothing less was mentioned. If the law required it to charge a higher rate for unlimited than for limited responsibility, it was its duty to quote such higher rate. Having failed to do this, it ought not afterwards to be permitted to take advantage of its own wrong. In view of the commerce act, I do not think the carrier, under such circumstances, is estopped from afterwards claiming the additional compensation that it ought to have exacted when quoting the rate. But I do think it ought to be held estopped from setting up any limitation of its responsibility, when no such limitation was in the contemplation of the patron on demanding the service.\n\n\n (8)\n As I read the interstate commerce act, it expresses in its own terms the extent of the prohibition of special contracts of carriage. As has often been said, the main purpose of the act was to prevent discrimination and the filing of the schedules is the principal means to that end. Section 6, as amended in 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 587, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1290), prohibits the carrier from transporting passengers or property unless the rates, fares, and charges upon which the same are transported have been filed and published in accordance with the act; from charging or collecting a different compensation for such transportation or for any service in connection with it than as specified in the tariff; and from refunding or remitting in any manner or by any device any portion of the specified rates, or ex- \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 147]\n\u00a0\n tending to any shipper or person any privileges or facilities except such as are specified in the tariff. When, therefore, a carrier has established and promulgated its tariff, with regulations as to service such as it has a lawful right to establish, the effect of  6 is to render unlawful any special contract of carriage made in contravention of the rates and regulations thus standardized in accordance with the law. Such is the effect of  6 of the act, and it was held to have that effect before the passage of the Hepburn act. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Hefley (1895) \n158 U.S. 98\n, 39 L. ed. 910, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 802; Texas & P. R. Co. v. Mugg ( 1906) \n202 U.S. 242\n, 50 L. ed. 1011, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 628; Chicago & A. R. Co. v. Kirby, \n225 U.S. 155\n, 56 L. ed. 1033, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648. All of these cases arose before the Hepburn act, and the decisions were based upon  6 of the act of February 4, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 379, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3154), as amended by act of March 2, 1889 (25 Stat. at L. 855, chap. 382, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3158, set forth above in the margin), which required the carrier to print and publicly post at each station for the inspection and information of the public the schedules of fares and rates for carriage of passengers and property, and provided that it should be unlawful for the carrier to depart from the published schedules; and upon the 3d section of the original act, which made it unlawful to give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular shipper. In the Hefley Case the question decided was simply that a statute of Texas imposing a penalty for a failure to deliver goods on tender of the rate named in the bill of lading was not applicable to interstate shipments. But the effect of the decision was to declare that one who had obtained from a common carrier transportation of goods from one state to another at a rate specified in the bill of lading, but less than the published schedule of rates filed with and approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission and in force at the time, whether he did or did not know that the rate obtained was less than the scheduled rate, was not entitled to recover the goods upon the tender of payment \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 148]\n\u00a0\n of the amount of charges named in the bill of lading, or of any sum less than the scheduled rates; in other words, that a special contract inconsistent with the published tariff could not avail. This principle was adopted as the ground of decision in the Mugg Case. And in the Kirby Case, likewise, it was held that as the broad purpose of the act was to compel the establishment of reasonable rates and their uniform application, a special contract by which advantage was given to a particular shipper could not be enforced. The distinction between a ground of action based upon the breach of such a special contract and one based upon the carrier's liability for negligence was clearly recognized in the opinion ( p. 166), and the latter ground of liability rejected because not presented by the record. To the same effect is Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 \nU.S. 467, 476\n, 55 S. L. ed. 297, 301, 34 L.R.A. (N.S.) 671, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 265, which arose after the Hepburn act.\n These cases rest fundamentally upon the ground that to allow the shipper to have the benefit of a special agreement for lower rates or for better service than the standard rates and service prescribed by the published schedules would in effect compel the carrier to violate the provisions of the act. In this sense, and to this extent, all shippers are 'bound' by the provisions of the act that bind the carrier. But to say that because of this a shipper or a passenger who has made no special contract at all, and claims the benefit of none, shall be conclusively deemed to have made a special contract, involving terms and conditions of which he was wholly ignorant, strikes me as a manifest non sequitur. And to hold that a passenger whose rights rest not upon any contract of shipment, but upon the negligence of the carrier, shall be barred from recovering full redress for the consequences of that negligence, upon the theory that he has unconsciously attempted to make a special contract in contravention of the act, is, I submit with respect, equally illogical. It seems also a \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 149]\n\u00a0\n complete reversal of the Hart Case and the Croninger Case, which declare that a carrier's liability for negligence can only be limited by such a contract or representation as shall estop the shipper,-to now hold that without any express contract or representation by the shipper the liability is limited, on the theory that he is legally charged with notice of requirements of which he was in fact ignorant.\n It is true that in the case at bar, the supreme court of Massachusetts (209 Mass. at p. 602) unnecessarily, and, as I think, erroneously, conceded that if the regulation limiting the baggage liability to $100 in value was so related to the rates of transportation of passengers as to be a part of such rate, the plaintiff was 'bound,' regardless of her knowledge or assent, and therefore her recovery in this action would be limited accordingly. The error, as it seems to me, arose from a misconception of the effect of the decisions in the Hefley and Mugg Cases. The fallacy, if I am correct in deeming it to be such, lies in the double sense of the word 'bound.' I respectfully suggest that this court, in a matter of such far-reaching importance, ought not to accept the concession without testing its soundness.\n If it were said that because she did not know of, and therefore did not assent to, a limitation of liability to $100, she remained still liable to pay to the railroad company the amount of money properly chargeable for the excess of valuation, and that the company had a lien upon the baggage for this amount on its arrival at destination, I could see the force of the suggestion. This would, perhaps, be within the doctrine of the Hefley and Mugg Cases. (Of course, I do not mean to say that the lien would survive after the goods were lost through the company's negligence.) But I can find nothing in any of the cases referred to that lends support to the view that a railroad company can limit its liability by limiting the rate charged, \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 150]\n\u00a0\n without according to the shipper or passenger any voice in the matter.\n The expressions employed in the Carl Case, \n227 U.S. 652\n, 57 L. ed. 688, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 391, that 'the valuation the shipper declares determines the legal rate where there are two rates based upon valuation,' and that 'when there are two published rates, based upon difference in value, the legal rate automatically attaches itself to the declared or agreed value,' had reference to the effect of a voluntary declaration made by a shipper who fixes the valuation of his goods for the purposes of the shipment, knowing that the valuation determines the rate that must be charged, although perhaps unaware what the precise rate may be. The same is true of similar language used in the Harriman Case, 227 U. S. at p. 669, 57 L. ed. 697, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397, the Cramer Case, 232 U. S. at p. 493, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 383, and the O'Connor Case, 232 U. S. at p. 515, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 380. I am unable to see that the reasoning applies to the case of a shipper or passenger who has declared no valuation, has exercised no choice, and is unaware that a choice is open.\n To say that constructive notice of the filed regulation, of which plaintiff was in fact ignorant, gave her an actual opportunity to declare the value of her baggage, pay the excess tariff rate, and thus secure the liability of the carrier to the full amount of her baggage, is to say that a fiction is the same as a fact.\n\n\n (9)\n In the Croninger Case, and the others of the same class, the shipper consciously accepted a benefit in the form of a reduced freight charge as the consideration of an agreement voluntarily made, valuing the goods for the purposes of the shipment. But here the plaintiff did nothing of the kind. She paid the full price asked by the carrier for transportation of herself and her baggage, unaware of any regulation of the carrier that would require the payment of an additional charge for an unlimited liability for baggage. If she were setting up and relying upon any special contract made in violation of the law, \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 151]\n\u00a0\n the doctrine of the Hefley, Mugg, and Kirby Cases would apply. But her cause of action is complete without resort to any contract, special or general; and the contract of which her passage tickets and the baggage checks were the tokens was merely the medium by which the carrier became possessed of her baggage. Having that baggage in its possession, the responsibility of the carrier for the exercise by itself and its employees of reasonable care for the safety of the goods arose under general principles of law independent of the contract; and those general principles as administered in the Federal courts (the same as in the courts of Massachusetts), entitled her to compensation upon the basis of the actual value of the goods lost, in the absence of a special agreement or of some representation of value made by her, limiting that liability.\n Conceding, for argument's sake, that the contract of carriage as made between plaintiff and defendant, if deemed to import responsibility for the entire value of the baggage, was invalid because not made in accordance with the regulations filed and published in connection with the rate schedules, and because of the provisions of the interstate commerce act that in effect forbid the making of contracts otherwise than in accord with those schedules,-even so, the plaintiff was in nowise at fault. She was unaware that she was at liberty to exercise any option, to say nothing of being under an obligation to do so. The fault was wholly with defendant, for it made no inquiry respecting the value of her baggage, and gave her no notice of any limitation of liability, although itself charged with notice from the very appearance of the baggage that it must have been worth more than $100. And her present action is based upon the carrier's negligence, and not upon an affirmance of the contract.\n Irrespective of the contract, the carrier, like any other bailee for hire, was bound to take reasonable care to preserve the property ready for delivery to its owner. I can \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 152]\n\u00a0\n find nothing in the letter or the spirit of the commerce act that forfeits her property or any part of its value because of her violation of the act, supposing her to have violated it. And since, through the carriers' negligence, the property was lost, it follows, on general principles, that her right of action, upon grounds independent of the contract, remains; it being based upon the general obligation of the bailee to do justice. The principle is fundamental and familiar, and has been applied in a great variety of cases. Planters' Bank v. Union Bank, 16 Wall. 483, 500, 21 L. ed. 473, 480; Philadelphia, W. & B. R. Co. v.

Mercer, 86 C. C. A. 435, 156 Fed. 545, 555; Re T. H. Bunch Co. 180 Fed. 519, 527.\n In Merchants' Cotton Press Co. v. Insurance Co. of N. A. \n151 \nU.S. 368, 388\n, 38 S. L. ed. 195, 205, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 499, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 367, this court held that while an agreement for special rates, rebates, or drawbacks was void under the interstate commerce act, the law did not make the contract of affreightment otherwise void, nor prevent liability on the part of the carrier for the freight received; that such a construction would encourage rather than discourage unlawful agreementsfor rebates, since the carrier might prefer them to a liability for the freight; andthat although the contract for rebate was void and unenforceable, the shipper could nevertheless recover for loss of his freight through the carrier's negligence. This decision has never been overruled or qualified, and it seems to me quite decisive of the present question.\n (10) Thus far I have treated the case as one arising under the common- law rules respecting the carrier's liability, as laid down in the decisions of this court and adopted generally by the Federal courts. I have en- \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 153]\n\u00a0\n deavored to show that a limitation of the carrier's liability is not permitted except it result from some actual representation or contract consciously assented to by the shipper, valuing the goods for the purposes of the shipment; that the sole ground for limiting the responsibility to this extent is that the shipper is estopped by his contract or his representations; that no different result is to be derived by any implication from the provisions of  6 of the interstate commerce act, which merely prevents the making of a special agreement inconsistent with the schedules, and does not compel the assumption (contrary to the fact) that a special agreement was made in conformity to them; that an agreement inconsistent with the schedules, even if void in itself, does not make the contract of affreightment otherwise void, nor prevent liability on the part of the carrier for loss of the goods attributable to its negligence; and that a shipper who has acted in good faith is not to be estopped upon the theory that a fiction or presumption of knowledge is equivalent to actual knowledge, or amounts to the same as conscious misrepresentation. I have hitherto refrained from attributing any special force to the Carmack amendment as regulative of the subject-matter.\n But let us now consider the specific force of that amendment (34 Stat. at L. 595, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1307, quoted in marginal note, ante, p. 126). It declares (inter alia) that a railroad company receiving property for interstate transportation 'shall issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor, and shall be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss, damage, or injury to such property caused by it . . . , and no contract, receipt, rule, or regulation shall exempt such common carrier, railroad, or transportation company from the liability hereby imposed.' It was concerning this provision that the court said in the Croninger Case, speaking by Mr. Justice Lurton, \n226 U.S. 505\n, 57 L. ed. 319, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148: 'That the legislation supersedes all the regulations and policies of a particular state upon the same subject results from its general character. It em- \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 154]\n\u00a0\n braces the subject of the liability of the carrier under a bill of lading which he must issue, and limits his power to exempt himself by rule, regulation, or contract.' This was equivalent to saying that because the carrier was obliged to issue to the shipper a receipt or bill of lading for the goods, and because the terms of the contract of carriage and rules and regulations pertaining thereto are presumably embodied in the receipt or bill of lading, therefore the act must be deemed and exercise by Congress of its general and exclusive power over the subject-matter.\n And the language of the enactment shows that it was framed in view of the general and familiar practice of embodying in the receipt or bill of lading all the terms of the contract, including the valuation of the goods and the rules and regulations for limiting the liability of the carrier. Is it not perfectly manifest that when Congress declared that the carrier 'shall issue a receipt or bill of lading' it intended that this document should embody the 'contract, receipt, rule, or regulation' that are mentioned in the same clause? Is it possible, without twisting the words from their plain meaning, to read this so that the duty of the carrier shall be performed if it issues a receipt or bill of lading that does not evidence the contract between the parties, and the whole of that contract?\n But in the present case there was no receipt or bill of lading within the meaning of the Carmack amendment as thus interpreted. There was nothing but three baggage checks, each bearing an identifying number, but, so far as the case shows, nothing else. I cannot agree that the statute leaves the carrier free to give a mere identifying token, instead of a 'receipt or bill of lading.' But, if I am wrong in this, it seems too clear for argument that so far as the carrier intends that any of its rules or regulations respecting its responsibility for the baggage are to be imported into the contract, it is incumbent upon it to set \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 155]\n\u00a0\n them forth plainly in a bill of lading delivered to the shipper or passenger. If the act admits of the construction that a mere identifying token or check can be used in the place of a formal receipt or bill of lading, it for that reason must require the construction that the carrier may, and that he does thereby, waive the benefit and protection of the rules and regulations. For I cannot believe that the Carmack amendment is open to the construction that the shipper shall be bound by special terms or conditions respecting anything pertaining to the contract of carriage and the carrier's responsibility, while the shipper is in fact ignorant of them. This would leave the carrier free to set a trap for the innocent shipper or passenger. Nor can I agree that the act requires any affirmative regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission prescribing the form of receipts to be given for baggage. I concede the Commission may regulate the matter, so long as it does so in conformity to the letter and spirit of the statute; but not that the act remains without vitality until the Commission breathes into it the breath of life. In my view, the railroad company in the present case, having failed to give such a receipt or bill of lading as the statute contemplates, cannot be heard to set up any limitation of its liability for the value of the goods, for it would thereby in effect claim a benefit from its own violation of the law.\n I submit that the Hepburn act, like the original act and its other amendments, is intended to impose duties upon the carrier,-the public servant,-not upon the shipper or passenger. There is nothing in the letter or the policy of the acts to absolve the carrier from its long-recognized duty to treat all shippers and passengers fairly, and to give them an actual opportunity to make a choice, where a choice is legally open to them. A carrier may not absolve himself in whole or in part from his responsibilities by any ex parte action. And where the rate schedules and accompanying regulations are designed to give an option \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 156]\n\u00a0\n to the shipper, it is, I submit, incumbent upon the carrier to see that the option is in good faith tendered, or else abide by the more onerous of the alternatives. The Carmack amendment means this, at least, if it means nothing more. Therefore, the failure to deliver a bill of lading evidencing the limitation of liability should impose upon the carrier the highest responsibility, not the least, that the regulations admit of; that is to say, an unlimited responsibility for the goods.\n (11) The serious consequences of the present decision are sufficiently manifest. Heretofore, shippers and passengers have been entitled to rest in the assurance that a common carrier who accepted their goods for transportation in the ordinary course of a carrier's public employment became responsible, without any express contract upon the subject, for the full value of the goods, in case of their destruction through any negligence of the carrier or its agents, unless there was a distinct understanding to the contrary, participated in by the shipper or passenger. Hereafter, so far as interstate shipments by rail are concerned, the traveler or shipper cannot rest upon any such assurance, and will not be safe in dealing with a railroad company without being authoritatively instructed respecting the latest regulations filed by the carrier with the Interstate Commerce Commission at Washington. He cannot rely upon finding the regulations posted in the railroad station, for this is not essential to the efficacy of the schedules (Texas & P. R. Co. v. Cisco Oil Mill, \n204 U.S. 449\n, 51 L. ed. 562, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 358). He cannot rely upon public notices that may be in fact posted in the station, for these may be misleading, as they were in the present case. He cannot rely upon receiving information from the company's local agents, for this may be withheld, as it was in this case. Unless he is possessed of a copy of the tariff schedules as filed, with time enough to scrutinize them, and skill enough to comprehend them, he must perforce accept \n\n[233 U.S. 97, 157]\n\u00a0\n whatever terms the railroad company may see fit to offer, and may not hope to be furnished with even a scrap of paper to indicate what those terms are.\n I can find no support for the result thus reached, either in the statute or in any previous decision. \n\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOWE v. SCOTT(1914)\nNo. 360\nArgued: May 6, 1914Decided: May 25, 1914\n\n\n\n\n Death of Nathaniel W. Bowe suggested, and appearance of Emma Lewis Bowe, executrix of the last will and testament of Nathaniel, filed and entered on May 6, 1914. \n\n[233 U.S. 658, 659]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Richard Evelyn Byrd and David Meade White for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Legh R. Page, John S. Eggleston, and John P. Leary for defendents in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n To an understanding of this case we outline the situation of the property in controversy:\n Shafer owned a tract of land which came to be within the limits of the city of Richmond, bounded on the north by Franklin street, on the south by Park avenue, on the east by Shafer and on the west by Harrison streets. He dedicated to public use by deed in due form, which was accepted by the city, a public alley 20 feet wide, crossing from Shafer to Harrison street at a distance of about 150 feet south of Franklin street, the alley being therefore between Franklin and Park avenue. All the plaintiffs but \n\n[233 U.S. 658, 660]\n\u00a0\n one owned lots fronting on the south side of Franklin street, running back and abutting on this alley. The exception was Bolton, whose property faced on Harrison street and was at the corner of that street and the alley. East of the lots fronting on Franklin street, owned by the plaintiffs in error, that is, nearer Shafer street than were such lots, the defendants in error, Scott and Myers, also owned lots in the south side of Franklin street, running back to the alley. They also owned property back of the alley, and which extended a considerable distance between parallel lines towards Park avenue. The city of Richmond passed an ordinance allowing Scott and Myers to close the alley along the line of their property for a period of thirty years upon the condition that they should not build upon it, that the right to keep it closed should be revocable by the city whenever it deemed best, and that the city should be held harmless for any damage which might be incurred from closing the alley. As the result of this ordinance the direct movement between Harrison and Shafer streets by means of the alley was cut off, but as the right to close only extended along the abutting lines of the Scott and Myers property, the alley remained open along the space where the property of the plaintiffs in error abutted, and hence did not disturb their direct access to Harrison street, and also did not deprive of access to Shafer street, as there were other alleys opening into the 20-foot alley between Harrison street and the point where the alley was closed by which this result could be accomplished.\n The plaintiffs in error then began this suit against the defendants in error to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance on the ground that, as the alley in question had been dedicated to the public by Shafer, and had been accepted by the city, and treated as a public alley for many years, the city was without power to grant the right to close it, and that doing so would wrongfully inflict damage upon \n\n[233 U.S. 658, 661]\n\u00a0\n the plaintiffs as the owners of the property abutting on the alley for reasons which were fully stated in the bill, and which it is unnecessary here to detail.\n The prayer was that the ordinance be declared null and void, and for an injunction enjoining the defendants from closing any portion of the said public alley 'so as to obstruct the free passage of your complainants and the public through the said alley.' Demurrers were sustained by the court of original jurisdiction, among others upon the ground that, 'conceding for the moment that the ordinance of the city of Richmond challenged in the bill is wholly void, yet this is an attempt made by private individuals to enjoin a public nuisance where the complainants do not show that they had suffered any special or peculiar damage.' The bill was dismissed.\n The court of appeals, in affirming the case, said:\n'Speaking generally, the obstruction of a public highway is a public nuisance, and the trend of authority is, that an individual cannot maintain a bill to enjoin such nuisance unless he can show that he has suffered, or will suffer therefrom, special and peculiar injury or damage to himself, as distinguished from injury or damage to the general public. Moreover, such special and peculiar injury or damage must be direct, and not purely consequential, and must be different in kind, and not merely in degree, from that sustained by the community at large.' [113 Va. 500, 75 S. E. 123.]\n\n And, referring to the opinion of the lower court, it was said:\n'The learned chancellor, in a clear and conclusive opinion, shows that though the injury to the plaintiffs, as stated in the bill, may be greater than that sustained by other persons living more remote from the scene of the obstruction, such injury is nevertheless greater in degree only, and not in kind. Therefore, under the authorities, the \n\n[233 U.S. 658, 662]\n\u00a0\n bill does not state a case of such special injury as would entitle the plaintiffs to an injunction. . . .\n\n'Concurring, as we do, in the ruling of the court sustaining the demurrer to the bill, it becomes unnecessary, and would, in deed, be improper, to express any opinion with respect to the validity of the ordinance, or the right of the public to redress the alleged invasion of their prerogative by prosecution, or other appropriate remedy, for a common nuisance.'\n\n The case is here upon the assumption that we have jurisdiction because Federal rights are involved; which hypothesis is challenged by a motion to dismiss which we at once come to consider.\n The grounds of the motion are, first, that as the court below rested its decision upon the want of right of the plaintiff to prevent the closing of the alley because such closing was, in any event, a public wrong which, under the circumstances, the complainants had no right to redress, the case below was decided upon a state ground which was independent of any assumed assertion of Federal right, and there is hence no jurisdiction. We do not stop to notice the many authorities which are cited to sustain from many different angles of vision the premise upon which the proposition rests because we think its inapplicability to the case in hand is so obvious that it is unnecessary to do so. This conclusion is evident because, upon the assumption that Federal rights were asserted, the contention of the complainants was that they had such an interest in the property, or were so peculiarly and especially damaged, that they had a right to prevent the closing of the alley which could not be taken from them without depriving them of their Federal rights. This being true, as it undoubtedly is, it follows that the decision of the court below, under the hypothesis stated, amounted to a denial of the existence of the Federal rights which were adequately asserted. And from this it follows that the proposition \n\n[233 U.S. 658, 663]\n\u00a0\n now relied upon, when rightly considered, comes to this: that jurisdiction to enforce and protect a Federal right obtains in no case where such Federal right has been denied.\n Second. It is further urged that, be this as it may, there is no jurisdiction because no assertion of rights under the Constitution was made below until the petition for rehearing, which was too late, and the tardiness of which was not saved by the action of the court, since it simply declined to grant the rehearing without deciding the questions presented as the basis of the request for rehearing. As it is elementary that a mere assertion in a state court of a right under the Constitution of the United States in a petition for rehearing affords no ground for invoking the jurisdiction of this court unless the court below, in dealing with the petition for rehearing, considers and passes upon the Federal ground therein relied upon, we dismiss that subject from view and come to consider whether the record otherwise discloses that a Federal question was so raised below as to support our jurisdiction. The contention that it was can alone rest upon two paragraphs in the bill as originally filed in the trial court; the one, No. 13, to the following effect:\n'Complainants charge and aver that the said ordinance is null and void because it is in conflict with  10, article 1, of the Constitution of the United States; that it impairs the obligation of a contract between the said John C. Shafer, who dedicated the land as for a public alley to the city of Richmond, which alley was accepted by the city of Richmond as an alley for public use.'\n\n As at best there was no averment in the bill of any contract made with the complainants, or any privity between them and Shafer, it cannot possibly be said that this averment amounted to the assertion of the existence in favor of the complainants of a contract protected by the Constitution from impairment. As the one party to the con- \n\n[233 U.S. 658, 664]\n\u00a0\n tract, Shafer, was not before the court, and was not suing either through himself or by anyone qualified to represent him, or having a legal right in his behalf to assert his contract rights, and as the other party to the contract was the city of Richmond, one of the defendants, the entire want of foundation for the assumption that the bill presented a case of impairment of the obligation of a contract within the guaranty of the Constitution of the United States becomes obvious. Besides, we think the conclusion cannot be escaped that when the paragraph in question is considered in the light of the context of the bill, it is conclusively inferable that the averment in the paragraph of an alleged contract between Shafer and the city was not asserted because of the assumed presence of rights under the Constitution in that regard, but solely as a means of stating in another form the want of power in the city to close the alley because, as the result of the contract with Shafer, it was bound to treat it as a public alley and not close it. And this is reinforced by the fact that no reference to any right under the contract clause is found in the opinion of the trial court, that no suggestion by way of amendment making clear the assertion of a Federal right found expression in an application which was made to amend the bill after the case had been decided, that no assertion of such right was contained in the assignments of error for the purpose of the review by the court of appeals, although the paragraph in question was referred to in the argument filed to support the assignments as made, and for the further reason that no intimation whatever is contained in the opinion of the court of appeals that it deemed that a question under the contract clause of the Constitution arose for decision.\n The other passage in the bill is found in subdivision 'c' of the tenth paragraph, and is as follows: 'That the ordinance is an attempt to take from your complainants, whose property adjoins and abuts upon the said alley, \n\n[233 U.S. 658, 665]\n\u00a0\n their rights in and to said alley without due process of law.' But it is settled that such an averment, making no reference to the Constitution of the United States, and asserting no express rights thereunder, is solely referable to the state Constitution, which, in this instance, has a due process clause, and affords no basis whatever for invoking the jurisdiction of this court. Miller v. Cornwall R. Co. \n168 U.S. 131\n, 42 L. ed. 409, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 34; Harding v. Illinois, \n196 U.S. 78\n, 49 L. ed. 394, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 176.\n As from what we have said it results that there is no foundation whatever for the claims of Federal right relied upon as the basis for invoking the jurisdiction of this court, since such claims are so wholly unsubstantial and frivolous as to be devoid of any merit, it follows that we have not jurisdiction, and the writ of error must be dismissed.\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOWLING v. U.S.(1914)\nNo. 177\nArgued: Decided: May 4, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. James H. Harkless, Halbert H. McCluer, and Roland Hughes for appellants.\n\n\n[233 U.S. 528, 530]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Knaebel and Mr. S. W. Williams for appellee.\n\n\n[233 U.S. 528, 532]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n Pursuant to the act of March 2, 1889, chap. 422 (25 Stat. at L. 1013), a tract of land in the Indian territory was allotted to Pe-te-lon-o-zah, or William Wea, a member of the confederated Wea, Peoria, Kaskaskia, and Piankeshaw tribes of Indians. The patent conveying the land to Wea and his heirs was issued on April 8, 1890, and imposed a restraint upon alienation for a period of twenty-five years from its date. Upon the death of Wea, his heirs entered into a contract to sell the land, and in a suit brought by them in the United States court for the northern district of the Indian Territory, for the purpose of enforcing the contract, judgment was entered sustaining its validity. The property was thereupon conveyed by the heirs and passed by various mesne conveyances to the appellants.\n The United States, by virtue of its interest in the enforcement of the restriction against alienation, instituted this suit to cancel these conveyances and also to set aside the above-mentioned judgment. The case was heard upon bill and answer, and a decree was rendered in favor of the United States, which was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. 111 C. C. A. 561, 191 Fed. 19.\n The relations of the government to these Indians, and the legislation with respect to the lands occupied by them, may be briefly stated. In 1832, the Piankeshaw and Wea tribes of Indians ceded to the United States their interest in lands within the states of Missouri and Illinois, and lands were set apart for them in what is now the state of Kansas (7 Stat. at L. 410), adjoining the lands assigned to the Peorias and Kaskaskias (7 Stat. at L. 403). In 1854, the Piankeshaws and Weas were united into a single tribe with the Peorias and Kaskaskias, and the consolidated tribes ceded to the United States all their interest in the tracts theretofore assigned to them, reserving, in addition to \n\n[233 U.S. 528, 533]\n\u00a0\n certain sections which were to be held as common property, a specified quantity of land for each individual, the patents for which were to be issued 'subject to such restrictions respecting leases and alienation as the President or Congress' might prescribe (10 Stat. at L. 1082; see Kansas Indians [Blue Jacket v. Johnson County] 5 Wall. 737, 757, 758, 18 L. ed. 667, 673, 674). By the treaty of February 23, 1867 (15 Stat. at L. 513, 518, 519), provision was made for the sale of the common tract in Kansas, and for the purchase with the proceeds of lands in the northeast portion of what is at present the state of Oklahoma; and to enable the Indians to dispose of their allotments in Kansas, the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to remove the restrictions upon sale. In 1873 (17 Stat. at L. 631), members of the tribe of Miamis, so electing, were united with these confederated tribes under the name of the United Peorias and Miamis. The territory which they occupied was expressly excepted from the operation of the general allotment act of February 8, 1887, chap. 119,  8 (24 Stat. at L. 388, 391); but the provisions of that statute, with certain exceptions, were extended to these Indians by the act of March 2, 1889 (25 Stat. at L. 1013, chap. 422).\n By the latter act, the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to make an allotment of land to each member, subject to the following restriction:\n'The land so allotted shall not be subject to alienation for twenty- five years from the date of the issuance of patent therefor, and said lands so allotted and patented shall be exempt from levy, sale, taxation, or forfeiture for a like period of years. As soon as all the allotments or selections shall have been made as herein provided, the Secretary of the Interior shall cause a patent to issue to each and every person so entitled, for his or her allotment, and such patent shall recite in the body thereof that the land therein described and conveyed shall not be alienated for twenty-five years from the date of said patent, and \n\n[233 U.S. 528, 534]\n\u00a0\n shall also recite that such land so allotted and patented is not subject to levy, sale, taxation, or forfeiture for a like period of years, and that any contract or agreement to sell or convey such land or allotments so patented, entered into before the expiration of said term of years, shall be absolutely null and void.'\n\n It was under this provision that the land here in question was patented to William Wea, the allottee.\n The confederated Peoria Indians who received allotments were made citizens of the United States by the act of May 2, 1890, chap. 182,  43 ( 26 Stat. at L. 81, 99); and in 1897, it was provided that adult allottees, who had received allotments of 200 acres or more, might sell 100 acres under such regulations as the Secretary of the Interior might prescribe. Act of June 7, 1897, chap. 3 (30 Stat. at L. 62, 72). Subsequent provisions permitted sales by heirs of allottees, but only upon the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. Acts of May 31, 1900, chap. 598 ,  7 (31 Stat. at L. 221, 248); May 27, 1902, chap. 888,  7 (32 Stat. at L. 245, 275).\n It is contended by the appellants that when the allotment was made, and the allottee became a citizen of the United States, the guardianship of the government ceased. But this contention is plainly untenable. Marchie Tiger v. Western Invest. Co. \n221 U.S. 286\n, 55 L. ed. 738, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 578. And it is no longer open to question that the United States has capacity to sue for the purpose of setting aside conveyances of lands allotted to Indians under its care, where restrictions upon alienation have been transgressed. Since the decision below, the precise question has been determined by this court in Heckman v. United States, \n224 U.S. 413\n, 56 L. ed. 820, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 424, and it was there held that the authority to enforce restrictions of this character is the necessary complement of the power to impose them. It necessarily follows that, as a transfer of the allotted lands contrary to the inhibition of Congress would be a violation of the governmental rights of the \n\n[233 U.S. 528, 535]\n\u00a0\n United States arising from its obligation to a dependent people, no stipulations, contracts, or judgments rendered in suits to which the government is a stranger can affect its interest. The authority of the United States to enforce the restraint lawfully created cannot be impaired by any action without its consent. Heckman v. United States, supra p. 445. If, therefore, the conveyance by the allottee's heirs in the present case, would otherwise have been subject to cancelation, it was not saved by reason of the judgment entered in their suit against the purchaser.\n The question, then, is whether the restriction imposed by the act of 1889 was a merely personal one, operative only upon the allottee, or ran with the land, binding his heirs as well. This must be answered by ascertaining the intent of Congress as expressed in the statute. The restriction was not limited to 'the lifetime of the allottee,' as in Mullen v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 448, 453\n, 56 S. L. ed. 834, 839, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 494, nor was the prohibition directed against conveyances made by the allottee personally. Congress explicitly provided that 'the land so allotted' should not be subject to alienation for twenty-five years from the date of patent. 'Said lands so allotted and patented' were to be exempt 'from levy, sale, taxation, or forfeiture for a like period of years.' The patent was expressly to set forth that 'the land therein described and conveyed' should not be alienated during this period, and all contracts 'to sell or convey such land' which should be entered into 'before the expiration of said term of years' were to be absolutely void. These reiterated statements of the restriction clearly define its scope and effect. It bound the land for the time stated, whether in the hands of the allottee or of his heirs. Moreover, the subsequent legislation, relating to the same subject-matter, which expressly provided for conveyances by heirs of allottees, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, leaves no room \n\n[233 U.S. 528, 536]\n\u00a0\n for doubt as to the intention of Congress. United States v. Freeman, 3 How. 556, 564, 11 L. ed. 724, 727; Cope v. Cope, \n137 \nU.S. 682, 688\n, 34 S. L. ed. 832, 834, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 222; Marchie Tiger v. Western Invest. Co. \n221 U.S. 309\n, 55 L. ed. 747, 31 Sup. Ct.

CITY OF WAYCROSS(1914)\nNo. 259\nArgued: Decided: April 6, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 16, 17]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Richard A. Jones, J. L. Sweat, and Nathan Frank for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 16, 18]\n\u00a0\n Mr. T. S. Felder, Attorney General of Georgia, and Mr. W. W. Lambdin for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 16, 19]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error was charged in a municipal court with violating an ordinance which imposed an annual occupation tax of $25 upon 'lightning rod agents or dealers engaged in putting up or erecting lightning rods within the corporate limits' of the city of Waycross. Althought admitting that he had carried on the business, he pleaded not guilty, and defended upon the gound that he had done so as the agent of a St. Louis corporation on whose behalf he had solicited orders for the sale of lightning rods; had received the rods when shipped on such orders from St. Louis, and had erected them for the corporation, the price paid for the rods to the corporation including the duty to erect them without further charge. This it was asserted constituted the carrying on of interstate commerce which the city could not tax without violating the Constitution of the United States. Although the facts alleged were established without dispute, there was a conviction and sentence, and the same result followed from a trial de novo in the superior court of Ware county, where the case was carried by certiorari. On error to the court of appeals that judgment was affirmed, the court stating its reasons for doing so in a careful and discriminating opinion reviewing and adversely passing upon the defense under the Constitution of the United States (11 Ga. App. 46, 74 S. E. 564). From that judgment this writ of error is prosecuted because of the constitutional question, and because under the law of Georgia the court of appeals had final authority to condlude the issue.\n The general principles by which it has been so frequently determined that a state may not burden by taxation or otherwise the taking of orders in one state for goods to be shipped from another, or the shipment of such goods in the channels of interstate commerce up \n\n[233 U.S. 16, 20]\n\u00a0\n to and including the consummation by delivery of the goods at the point of shipment, have been so often stated as to cause them to be elementary, and as to now require nothing but a mere outline of the principle. The sole question, therefore, here, is whether carrying on the business of erecting lightning rods in the state, under the conditions established, was interstate commerce beyond the power of the state to regulate or directly burden. The solution of the inquiry will, we think, be most readily reached by briefly reviewing a few of the more recently decided cases which are relied upon to establish that although the interstate transit of the lightning rods had terminated any they had been delivered at the point of destination to the agent of the seller, the business of subsequently attaching them to the houses for which they were intended constituted the carrying on of interstate commerce. The cases relied on are Caldwell v. North Carolina, \n187 U.S. 622\n, 47 L. ed. 336, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229; Rearick v. Pennsylvania, \n203 U.S. 507\n, 51 L. ed. 295, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 159; and Dozier v. Alabama, \n218 U.S. 124\n, 54 L. ed. 965, 28 L.R.A. (N.S.) 264, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 649.\n Caldwell v. North Carolina concerned the validity of an ordinance of the village of Greensboro, imposing a tax upon the business of selling or delivering picture frames, photographs, etc. The question was whether Caldwell, the agent of an Illinois corporation, was liable for this tax, because in Greensboro he had taken from a railroad freight office certain packages of frames and pictures which were awaiting delivery, and which had been shipped to Greensboro by the selling corporation to its own order, for the purpose of filling orders previously obtained by its agents in North Carolina. After the packages of frames and pictures were received by Caldwell, in a room in a hotel, the pictures and frames were fitted together and were delivered to those who had ordered them. The assertion that there was liability for the tax was based on the contention that the act of Caldwell in receiving the pictures and frames and bringing them together was not under the \n\n[233 U.S. 16, 21]\n\u00a0\n protection of the commerce clause, but was the transaction of local business after the termination of interstate commerce; especially because the pictures and frames had been shipped from Chicago in separate packages, and because the pictures and frames were incomplete on their arrival, and were made complete in the state by the union accomplished after the end of their movement in interstate commerce. Both of these propositions were decided to be unsound, and it was adjudged that as both the pictures and frames had been ordered from another state, and their shipment was the fulfilment of an interstate commerce transaction, the mere fact that they were shipped in separate packages and brought together at the termination of the transit did not amount to the transaction of business within North Carolina which the state could tax without placing a direct burden upon interstate commerce. In Rearick v. Pennsylvania, where the right to levy a tax was decided not to exist because to sustain it would be a direct burden upon interstate commerce, the only question was whether the form in which certain shipments of goods were made from Ohio into Pennsylvania to fill orders was of such a character as to cause the act of the agent of the shipper, who opened the packages for the purpose of distributing the goods to those for whom they were intended, to amount to the carrying on of business in the state of Pennsylvania. Dozier v. Alabama in substance concerned the principles applied in the two previous cases with the modification that it was there held that because there was no binding obligation on a purchaser to accept the frame which was to accompany a picture ordered from another state, and transmitted through interstate commerce, did not take the case out of the previous ruling.\n It is evident that these cases when rightly considered, instead of sustaining, serve to refute, the claim of protection under the interstate commerce clause which is here \n\n[233 U.S. 16, 22]\n\u00a0\n relied upon, since the cases were concerned only with merchandise which had moved in interstate commerce, and where the transactions which it was asserted amounted to the doing of local business consisted only of act concerning interstate commerce goods, dissociated from any attempt to connect them with or make them a part in the state of property which had not and could not have been the subject of interstate commerce. Thus, in Caldwell v. North Carolina, the court laid emphasis upon the fact that the shipment of the pictures in interstate commerce in one package and the frames in another was not essential but accidental, for the two could have been united at the point of shipment before interstate commerce began as well as be brought together after delivery at the point of destination. And this was also the condition in the Rearick Case. Indeed, it is apparent in all three cases that there was not the slightest purpose to enlarge the scope of interstate commerce so as to cause it to embrace acts and transactions theretofore confessedly local, but simply to prevent the recognized local limitations from being used to put the conceded interstate commerce power in a strait-jacket so as to destroy the possibilities of its being adapted to meet mere changes in the form by which business of an inherently interstate commerce character could be carried on.\n We are of the opinion that the court below was right in holding that the business of erecting lightning rods under the circumstances disclosed was within the regulating power of the state, and not the subject of interstate commerce, for the following reasons: (a) Because the affixing of lightning rods to houses was the carrying on of a business of a strictly local character, peculiarly within the exclusive control of state authority. (b) Because, besides, such business was wholly separate from interstate commerce, involved no question of the delivery of property shipped in interstate commerce, or of the right to complete \n\n[233 U.S. 16, 23]\n\u00a0\n an interstate commerce transaction, but concerned merely the doing of a local act after interstate commerce had completely terminated. It is true that it was shown that the contract under which the rods were shipped bound the seller, at his own expense, to attach the rods to the houses of the persons who ordered rods, but it was not within the power of the parties by the from of their contract to convert what was exclusively a local business, subject to state control, into an interstate commerce business, protected by the commerce clause. It is manifest the if the right here asserted were recognized, or the power to accomplish by contract what is here claimed were to be upheld, all lines of demarcation between national and state authority would become obliterated, since it would necessarily follow that every kind or form of material shipped from one state to the other, and intended to be used after delivery in the construction of buildings or in the making of improvements in any form, would or could be made interstate commerce.\n Or course we are not called upon here to consider how far interstate commerce might be held to continue to apply to an article shipped from one state to another, after delivery and up to and including the time when the article was put together or made operative in the place of destination in a case where, because of some intrinsic and peculiar quality or inherent complexity of the article, the making of such agreement was essential to the accomplishment of the interstate transaction. In saying this we are not unmindful of the fact that some suggestion is here made that the putting up of the lighning rods after delivery by the agent of the seller was so vital and so essential as to render it impossible to contract without an agreement to that effect,-a suggestion, however, which we deem it unnecessary to do more than mention in order to refute it.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","23":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBURBANK V ERNST(1914)\nNo. 151\nArgued: Decided: January 26, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 162, 163]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles S. Rice, Sam Streetman, and Richard B. Montgomery for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Henry P. Dart for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case arises in the matter of the succession of T. Scott Burbank. He died in Texas on May 10, 1910, leaving a will dated March 22, 1910, which was admitted to probate there. The executors sought to have the will registered in Louisiana, but the tutrix of Burbank's minor daughter and sole heir filed in the succession record a direct action to annul the will on the ground that the testator died domiciled in Louisiana, and that, by the laws of that state, the will was void. The supreme court of Louisiana gave judgment against the will, and ordered the application for registry to be dismissed 'as of nonsuit.' 129 La. 528, 56 So. 430. The error assigned is that full faith and credit were not given to the Texas decree.\n Of course, the jurisdiction of the Texas court depended upon the domicil of Burbank, which therefore was open to re-examination. Andrews v. Andrews, \n188 U.S. 14\n, 47 L. ed. 366, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 237. The objection urged is that the Louisiana court attributed conclusive effect to Burbank's conduct in Louisiana, taken \n\n[232 U.S. 162, 164]\n\u00a0\n in connection with the laws there, instead of recognizing that no statute of that state could prevent his acquiring a domicil wherever he actually might be, elsewhere, and instead of treating the question as one of intent and fact. Burbank was one of the executors under his father's will, and as such, on April 8, 1909, at that time being a resident of New Orleans, declared before a notary that then being about to absent himself temporarily from Louisiana, and in order to comply with the law, especially article 1154 of the Revised Civil Code, he constituted one Billings his attorney. If he left the state permanently, his duty, we are told by the supreme court, was to surrender his trust, render an account, and pay over any balance due. It is true that in his Texas will he declared that Texas was his permanent home, and that he made similar declarations orally and in writing; but, on the other hand, it is found that his agent continued to represent him, and it seems that he continued to act, as an executor temporarily absent. He had made a will in Louisiana just before leaving, but ten days before making the Texas will he had consulted a lawyer as to making a will that would be valid by the law of Texas, which law allowed dispositions not valid by the law of Louisiana, where most of his property was. The supreme court not unnaturally suspected, from the declaration of domicil in the will and the circumstances, that Burbank was making up a fictitious case in the hope of avoiding the restrictions of his real domicil before he killed himself, as it is said that he did, in May; and found that the Texas declarations were more than counterbalanced by his declaration of record and his official acts as executor resident in Louisiana. There can be no question that the evidence was conflicting and that the court was warranted in finding as it did.\n It is not for us to retry the facts. The ground of the argument here is a statement in the opinion of the court that the recital in the notarial act was conclusive evidence \n\n[232 U.S. 162, 165]\n\u00a0\n that Burbank left the state with the intention of returning; but that does not import a failure to recognize, as the court clearly did recognize, that he might change his mind. Reliance also is placed upon the headnote of the decision. which states that the intent to leave only temporarily is conclusively presumed to continue until the notarial procuration is recalled, and that the executors are concluded from asserting a change of domicil. But the headnote is given no special force by statute or rule of court, as in some states. It inaccurately represents the reasoning of the judgment. In 129 La. it is said to have been made by the court. However that may be, we look to the opinion for the original and authentic statement of the grounds of decision. It may be that in fact the conduct of the testator in Louisiana was given greater weight, because of the statutes of the state, than others might give it, but no error of law appears that would warrant a reversal of the judgment below.

Maxwell Evarts, Henry W. Clark, Gordon M. Buck, and A. A. Hoehling, Jr., for appellees.\n Solicitors General Bullitt and Davis, Assistant Attorney General Knaebel, and Mr. B. D. Townsend for the United States.\n Messrs. Charles W. Bunn and Charles Donnelly for the Northern Pacific Railroad Company.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n In 1910 Edmund Burke filed a bill in equity in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 672]\n\u00a0\n of California, against the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, the Kern Trading & Oil Company, and several individuals, wherein he sought a decree establishing certain rights claimed by him in five sections of land in Fresno county, California, and enjoining the defendants from asserting any right or interest therein. A cross bill was filed by J. I. Lamprecht and other individual defendants, and the two corporate defendants demurred to both bills. The demurrers were sustained and a decree was entered dismissing the bills, for reasons assigned in an opinion announced the same day in Roberts v. Southern P. Co. 186 Fed. 934. The complainant and cross complainants appealed to the circuit court of appeals, and it certified the case here under the Judicial Code,  239 [36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 228], for instruction upon designated questions of law.\n According to the certificate, the bill alleged, in substance, that in 1892 the five sections were public lands and were located as placer mining claims under the mining laws of the United States, each location being preceded by a discovery of mineral within its limits; that on May 9, 1892, the railroad company, with knowledge of these locations, made application at the local land office to have the five sections, with others, patented to it under the land grant made to it by the act of July 27, 1866 (14 Stat. at L. 292, chap. 278,  3, 4, 18), and the joint resolution of June 28, 1870 (16 Stat. at L. 382, No. 87), and did then corruptly cause one Madden, its land agent, to make and present at such land office, in support of such application, a false and fraudulent affidavit stating that the application contained a correct list of lands inuring to the railroad company under its grant, and that the listed lands were vacant, unappropriated, and not interdicted, mineral, or reserved lands; that no notice of such application was given to any of the placer claimants, and no hearing was had in the local office or in the Land Department with the purpose of \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 673]\n\u00a0\n determining the character of the lands; that on July 10, 1894, without any such investigation or determination, a patent was issued to the railroad company purporting to convey to it, among other lands, the five sections in controversy; that the patent contained a clause reading: 'Excluding and excepting all mineral lands should any such be found in the tracts aforesaid, but this exclusion and exception, according to the terms of the statute, shall not be construed to include coal and iron lands;' that the railroad company accepted the patent and caused it to be recorded in Fresno county; that, in virtue of the patent, the railroad company claims to own all the lands described therein, including the five sections; that in March, 1909, the original mineral claimants having failed to perform the required assessment or development work for the preceding year, the complainant and certain associates of his entered upon the five sections and relocated the same as placer mining claims under the mining laws of the United States, each of the new locations being preceded by a discovery of mineral within its limits; that the lands contain petroleum in commercial quantities, which makes them more valuable for mining than for agricultural purposes; that the complainant is the owner of an undivided one-tenth interest in the mining claims created by the new location; and that the oil company, although claiming as a lessee of the railroad company, is a mere instrument of the latter, being entirely owned, dominated, and controlled by it.\n According to the certificate, the cross bill set forth substantially a like state of facts, sought the same relief, and also contained the following allegation: 'These cross complainants further say and show unto the court that the said Southern Pacific Railroad Company, with full knowledge of all the facts and circumstances herein stated and alleged, did, for itself, its successors and assigns forever, accept and assent to, and submit to, and agree to \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 674]\n\u00a0\n be bound by, each and all of the provisions, stipulations, terms, conditions, restrictions, limitations, exclusions, and reservations in said act and joint resolution, and in said patent, or either or any of them contained, and so accepting the same and assenting and submitting thereto, and agreeing to be bound thereby, did receive and accept said alleged patent, and cause the same to be recorded in the office of the recorder of the county of Fresno, and state of California, and that said defendant, Southern Pacific Railroad Company, and all persons claiming any interest in said lands or any part thereof, under or through it by virtue of said act of Congress and joint resolution, and said patent, or any or either of them, are bound by all of said provisions, stipulations, terms, conditions, restrictions, limitations, exclusions, exceptions, and reservations, and are in equity and in conscience estopped to resist or deny the binding force and effect of same or any part or any thereof.'\n The questions propounded in the certificate are as follows:\n'First. Did the said grant to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company include mineral lands which were known to be such at or prior to the date of the patent of July 10, 1894?\n\n'Second. Does a patent to a railroad company under a grant which excludes mineral lands, as in the present case, but which is issued without any investigation upon the part of the officers of the Land Office or of the Department of the Interior as to the quality of the land, whether agricultural or mineral, and without hearing upon or determination of the quality of the lands, operate to convey lands which are thereafter ascertained to be mineral?\n\n'Third. Is the reservation and exception contained in the grant in the patent to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company void and of no effect?\n\n'Fourth. If the reservation of mineral lands as ex- \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 675]\n\u00a0\n pressed in the patent is void, then is the patent, upon a collateral attack, a conclusive and official declaration that the land is agricultural, and that all the requirements preliminary to the issuance of the patent have been complied with?\n\n'Fifth. Is petroleum or mineral oil within the meaning of the term 'mineral' as it was used in said acts of Congress reserving mineral land from the railroad land grants?\n\n'Sixth. Does the fact that the appellant was not in privity with the government in any respect at the time when the patent was issued to the railroad company prevent him from attacking the patent on the ground of fraud, error, or irregularity in the issuance thereof, as so alleged in the bill?\n\n'Seventh. If the mineral exception clause was inserted in the patent with the consent of the defendant, Southern Pacific Railroad Company, and under an understanding and agreement between it and the officers of the Interior Department that said clause should be effective to keep in the United States title to such of the lands described in the patent as were in fact mineral, are the defendants, Southern Pacific Railroad Company and the Kern Trading & Oil Company, estopped to deny the validity of said clause?'\n\n At the outset it is well to observe that this is not a suit by the government to cancel or annul a patent for fraud practised upon the land officers in its procurement, or for any fraudulent act, error of law, or mistake committed by them in issuing it (see United States v. Minor, \n114 U.S. 233\n, 29 L. ed. 110, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 836; United States v. San Jacinto Tin Co. \n125 U.S. 273\n, 31 L. ed. 747, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 850; United States v. Trinidad Coal & Coping Co. \n137 U.S. 160\n, 34 L. ed. 640, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 57; Germania Iron Co. v. United States, \n165 U.S. 379\n, 41 L. ed. 754, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 337); nor is it a suit to have one to whom a patent has issued declared a trustee for another who, at the time of its issue, had acquired such a right to the land as to entitle him to that form of equitable relief (see Silver v. Ladd, 7 Wall. 219, 228, 19 L. ed. 138, 141; Lee v. \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 676]\n\u00a0\n Johnson, \n116 U.S. 48\n, 29 L. ed. 570, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249; Duluth & I. Range R. Co. v. Roy, \n173 U.S. 587\n, 43 L. ed. 820, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 549; Svor v. Morris, \n227 U.S. 524\n, 57 L. ed. 623, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 385). On the contrary, the suit is one wherein rights asserted under a patent are called in question by parties whose only claim to the land was initiated more than fourteen years after the date of the patent.\n As the fifth question has been presented in separate briefs and the occasion for considering the other questions turns upon the answer to it, we take it up first. It is: 'Is petroleum or mineral oil within the meaning of the term 'mineral' as it was used in said acts of Congress reserving mineral land from the railroad land grants?'\n This granting act, like several others of that period, expressly excluded from its operation 'all mineral lands' other than iron and coal lands. No attempt was made at defining 'mineral lands,' and doubtless the ordinary or popular signification of that term was intended. Apparently it was used in a sense which, if not restricted, would embrace iron and coal lands, else care hardly would have been taken to declare that it should not include them. This was deemed a reasonable inference in Northern P. R. Co. v. Soderberg, \n188 U.S. 526\n, 47 L. ed. 575, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 365, where a contention that it embraced only metalliferous lands was rejected. The question there was whether it included lands containing valuable bodies of granite, and the holding was that it did. While avoiding an exact definition, the court was of opinion that it comprehended all lands 'chiefly valuable for their deposits of a mineral character, which are useful in the arts or valuable for purposes of manufacture.'\n Petroleum has long been popularly regarded as a mineral oil. As its derivation indicates, the word means 'rock oil,' an oily substance so named because found naturally oozing from crevices in rocks. Its existence in this country was known from very early times, and when this and other railroad land grants, containing an \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 677]\n\u00a0\n exception of mineral lands, were made, the extraction of oil from its natural reservoir in subterranean rocks had come to be a promising industry and was extending over an increasing area through discoveries of new oil fields. An official report laid before Congress a few months before this grant was made showed that the daily output of the oil wells in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky was 12,000 barrels. H. R. Ex. Doc. No. 51, 39th Cong. 1st Sess. In the same year the supreme court of Pennsylvania, in disposing of an oil-land controversy, not only treated the oil as a mineral, but spoke of the work of extracting it from the containing rocks as 'mining for oil;' and, in concluding the opinion, said: 'Until our scientific knowledge on the subject is increased, this is the light in which the courts will be likely to regard this valuable production of the earth.' Funk v. Haldeman, 53 Pa. 229, 7 Mor. Min. Rep. 203. And in another case that court said: 'It is a mineral substance obtained from the earth by a process of mining, and lands from which it is obtained may with propriety be called mining lands.' Gill v. Weston, 110 Pa. 312, 317, 1 Atl. 921. Its mineral character has also been affirmed by the courts of other states. Williamson v. Jones, 39 W. Va. 231, 256, 25 L. R.A. 222, 19 S. E. 436; Kelley v. Ohio Oil Co. 57 Ohio St. 317, 328, 39 L. R.A. 765, 63 Am. St. Rep. 721, 49 N. E. 399; Murray v. Allred, 100 Tenn. 100, 39 L.R.A. 249, 66 Am. St. Rep. 740, 43 S. W. 355, 19 Mor. Min. Rep. 169; Wagner v. Mallory, 169 N. Y. 501, 505, 62 N. E. 584, 22 Mor. Min. Rep. 42. Congress at different times has spoken of it as a mineral (15 Stat. at L. 59, chap. 41,  1; id. 167, chap. 186,  109; 29 Stat. at L. 526, chap. 216, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1434; 32 Stat. at L. 702, chap. 1369,  42; 36 Stat. at L. 847, chap. 421, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 593), and this court did so in Ohio Oil Co. v. Indiana, \n177 \nU.S. 190, 202\n, 44 S. L. ed. 729, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 576, 20 Mor. Min. Rep. 466.\n In the legislation of Congress the term 'mineral lands' is not confined to railroad land grants. It occurs in the mining laws, in an excepting clause in the homestead law, and in like clauses in other public- land laws. Evidently it has the same meaning in all. The administration of these laws has rested with the Land Department, and there- \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 678]\n\u00a0\n fore its course of action in respect of oil-bearing lands-whether it has held them to be mineral or otherwise-requires to be noticed. The various mining circulars, instructions, and decisions, as published from time to time, show that the matter probably was not considered prior to the first mining circular, July 15, 1873, but that since then the Department has regarded petroleum as a mineral, and has treated lands chiefly valuable therefor as mineral lands. \n1\n With a single exception, the rulings have been uniform, and lands of great value have passed into private ownership under them. The single exception is the case of Re Union Oil Co. 23 Land Dec. 222, 226, decided August 27, 1896, which was revoked on a motion for review November 6, 1897, 25 Land Dec. 351. It appears from the later decision that action upon other pending eases turning upon the same question had been suspended in the meantime, so, practically speaking, there has been no break in the Department's rulings. The case of Union Oil Co. presented a controversy between that company and the Southern Pacific Railroad Company over a tract of land in California, the former claiming under a placer mining claim and insisting that the land was chiefly valuable for petroleum, and therefore mineral, and the latter seeking a patent under its land grant and insisting that the land, even if chiefly valuable for petroleum, was not mineral. In the original decision the Secretary of the Interior held that the word 'mineral' embraced only 'the more precious metals,' such as 'gold, silver, cinnabar, etc.,' but on the rehearing this view was rejected and the prior rulings holding petroleum to be a mineral \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 679]\n\u00a0\n were reaffirmed and applied, the railroad company's application for a patent being denied.\n Notwithstanding these persuasive considerations for now regarding petroleum lands as mineral lands within the meaning of the excepting clause in the granting act, we are asked to give effect to the strictly scientific view that petroleum is a resultant of the decomposition of organic matter under certain conditions of temperature and pressure, and therefore is not a mineral. As we understand it, scientists are not in full accord upon this point, some ascribing to petroleum an inorganic origin. 21 Enc. Britannica, 11th ed. p. 318. But, passing this seeming divergence in opinion, and assuming that, when subjected to a strictly scientific test, petroleum is not a mineral, we think that is not the test contemplated by the statute. It was dealing with a practical subject in a practical way, and we think it used the words 'mineral lands,' and intended that they should be applied, in their ordinary and popular sense. In that sense, as before indicated, they embrace lands chiefly valuable for petroleum.\n Our answer to the fifth question must therefore be in the affirmative.\n The other questions are so closely related one to another, and turn so largely upon principles of general application to controversies arising out of the public-land laws, including railroad land grants, that it seems the better course to consider them in a general way in connection with those principles, and then to come to the specific answers to be given to them separately.\n We first notice a contention advanced on the part of the mineral claimants, to the effect that the grant to the railroad company was merely a gift from the United States, and should be construed and applied accordingly. The granting act not only does not support the contention, but refutes it. The act did not follow the building of \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 680]\n\u00a0\n the road, but preceded it. Instead of giving a gratuitous reward for something already done, the act made a proposal to the company to the effect that if the latter would locate, construct, and put into operation a designated line of railroad, patents would be issued to the company confirming in it the right and title to the public lands falling within the descriptive terms of the grant. The purpose was to bring about the construction of the road, with the resulting advantages to the government and the public, and to that end provision was made for compensating the company, if it should do the work, by patenting to it the lands indicated. The company was at liberty to accept or reject the proposal. It accepted in the mode contemplated by the act, and thereby the parties were brought into such contractual relations that the terms of the proposal became obligatory on both. Menotti v. Dillon, \n167 \nU.S. 703, 721\n, 42 S. L. ed. 333, 339, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 945. And when, by constructing the road and putting it in operation, the company performed its part of the contract, it became entitled to performance by the government. In other words, it earned the right to the lands described. Of course, any ambiguity or uncertainty in the terms employed should be resolved in favor of the government, but the grant should not be treated as a mere gift.\n Two distinct land grants were made to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, one on behalf of the construction of a main line, and the other ( act March 3, 1871, 16 Stat. at L. 579, chap. 122,  23) on behalf of a branch line. We are not here concerned with the latter. The former was made by the act of July 27, 1866, 14 Stat. at L. 292, chap. 278. That act first made provision for the construction of a line of railroad, by the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company, from Springfield, Missouri, westward through northern Arizona to the Pacific ocean, and by its 3d and 4th sections made the following grant of public lands to that company: \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 681]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 3. That there be, and hereby is, granted to the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company, its successors and assigns, for the purpose of aiding in the construction of said railroad and telegraph line to the Pacific coast, and to secure the safe and speedy transportation of the mails, troops, munitions of war, and public stores, over the route of said line of railway and its branches, every alternate section of public land, not mineral, designated by odd numbers, to the amount of twenty alternate sections per mile, on each side of said railroad line, as said company may adopt, through the territories of the United States, and ten alternate sections of land per mile on each side of said railroad whenever it passes through any state, and whenever, on the line thereof, the United States have full title, not reserved, sold, granted, or otherwise appropriated, and free from pre-emption or other claims or rights, at the time the line of said road is designated by a plat thereof, filed in the office of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and whenever, prior to said time, any of said sections or parts of sections shall have been granted, sold, reserved, occupied by homestead settlers, or pre-empted, or otherwise disposed of, other lands shall be selected by said company in lieu thereof, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in alternate sections, and designated by odd numbers, not more than ten miles beyond the limits of said alternate sections, and not including the reserved numbers. . . . Provided, further, That all mineral lands be, and the same are hereby, excluded from the operations of this act, and in lieu thereof a like quantity of unoccupied and unappropriated agricultural lands in odd- numbered sections nearest to the line of said road, and within twenty miles thereof, may be selected as above provided: And provided further, That the word 'mineral,' when it occurs in this act, shall not be held to include iron or coal: . . .\n'Sec. 4. That whenever said Atlantic & Pacific Rail- \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 682]\n\u00a0\n road Company shall have twenty-five consecutive miles of any portion of said railroad and telegraph line ready for the service contemplated, the President of the United States shall appoint three commissioners to examine the same, who shall be paid a reasonable compensation for their services by the company, to be determined by the Secretary of the Interior; and if it shall appear that twenty-five consecutive miles of said road and telegraph line have been completed in a good, substantial, and workmanlike manner, as in all other respects required by this act, the commissioners shall so report under oath, to the President of the United States, and patents of lands, as aforesaid, shall be issued to said company, confirming to said company the right and title to said lands situated opposite to and coterminous with said completed section of said road. And from time to time, whenever twenty-five additional consecutive miles shall have been constructed, completed, and in readiness as aforesaid, and verified by said commissioners to the President of the United States, then patents shall be issued to said company conveying the additional sections of land as aforesaid, and so on as fast as every twenty-five miles of said road is completed as aforesaid.'\n\n By its 18th section the act made provision for the construction by the Southern Pacific Railroad Company of a connecting line of railroad from the eastern boundary of California to San Francisco, and in that connection made the grant now under consideration. That section reads:\n'That the Southern Pacific Railroad, a company incorporated under the laws of the state of California, is hereby authorized to connect with the said Atlantic & Pacific Railroad, formed under this act, at such point, near the boundary line of the state of California, as they shall deem most suitable for a railroad line to San Francisco, and shall have a uniform gauge and rate of freight or fare \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 683]\n\u00a0\n with said road; and in consideration thereof, to aid in its construction, shall have similar grants of land, subject to all the conditions and limitations herein provided, and shall be required to construct its road on the like regulations, as to time and manner, with the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad herein provided for.'\n\n Turning to  3 and 4, as must be done, to ascertain the nature, extent, conditions, and limitations of the grant made by this section, it will be seen that it was of 'every alternate section of public land, not mineral, designated by odd numbers,' etc., and was accompanied by a declaration 'that all mineral lands be, and the same are hereby, excluded from the operations of this act, and in lieu thereof a like quantity of unoccupied and unappropriated agricultural lands in odd-numbered sections nearest to the line of said road, and within twenty miles thereof, may be selected as above provided.' Words hardly could make it plainer that mineral lands were not included, but expressly excluded. This is fully recognized by counsel on both sides. But by whom and when was it to be determined whether lands otherwise within the grant were mineral and therefore excluded, or nonmineral and therefore included? How long was the question of the exclusion or inclusion of particular sections to be an open one? Was it to depend upon a discovery of mineral at any time in the future, even a hundred years after the completion of the railroad, or was it intended that the mineral or nomineral character of the lands should be determined in administering the grant, and that, depending on the result, patents should issue or indemnity be allowed? We think these questions find clear and decisive answers in the granting act when considered in the light of settled principles of general application to the administration of the public-land laws, including railroad land grants.\n As has been seen, the exclusion was of 'all mineral lands.' It was not a mere reservation of minerals, but \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 684]\n\u00a0\n an exclusion of mineral lands, coupled with a provision that the company should receive other lands, not mineral, in lieu of them. This shows that a determination of the character of the lands, as mineral or nonmineral, was plainly contemplated. Besides, there was an exclusion of all sections and parts of sections 'granted, sold, reserved, occupied by homestead settlers, or pre-empted, or otherwise disposed of' when the line of the road should be definitely located, and this was followed by a similar provision for lieu lands. The two exclusions and the indemnity provisions made it practically imperative that there be an authoritative identification of the lands passing under the grant and of those excluded, for otherwise great uncertainty in titles, conflicting claims, and vexatious litigation would be inevitable. Appreciative of this, Congress confided the identification of the lands, both included and excluded, to the Land Department, of which the Secretary of the Interior is the supervising officer. We say their identification was confided to that Department, because the granting act expressly provided for the issue of patents 'confirming to said company the right and title to said lands,' obviously meaning the lands granted, but not the excluded lands, and also directed that the indemnity lands be selected 'under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior,' and because that Department was already expressly charged with the administration and execution of all public-land laws as to which it was not specially provided otherwise. Rev. Stat.  441, 453, 2478, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 252, 257, 1586. In Catholic Bishop v. Gibbon, \n158 \nU.S. 155, 166\n, 167 S., 39 L. ed. 931, 936, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 779, which related to a grant, the identification and extent of which depended, as here, upon an ascertainment of matters of fact made material by the granting act, this court said: 'While there may be no specific reference in the act of 1848 [9 Stat. at L. 323, chap. 177] of questions arising under this grant to the Land Department, yet its administration comes within the scope of the general \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 685]\n\u00a0\n powers vested in that Department. . . . It may be laid down as a general rule that, in the absence of some specific provision to the contrary in respect to any particular grant of public land, its administration falls wholly and absolutely within the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, under the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior. It is not necessary that with each grant there shall go a direction that its administration shall be under the authority of the Land Department. It falls there unless there is express direction to the contrary.'\n True, the grant now under consideration was in proesenti in the sense that the title to the granted lands, when they should be identified, passed as of the date of the granting act; but, as has been indicated, the act did not itself identify them, and in the nature of things that was not practicable. It was not certain that the road would be constructed, or what lands would be free from other claims at the time of its definite location, or what would be mineral. This led to the use of general descriptive terms which required to be applied to particular lands, should the road be constructed. And so it was that provision was made for issuing patents 'confirming to said company the right and title to said lands' after construction. A real necessity would then arise for identifying the lands passing under the grant. This was obviously the purpose of the patents. They were to be in confirmation of the company's 'right and title,' and so were to be the legally appointed evidence that the lands described in them had passed to the company under the grant.\n As it plainly was not intended that patents should issue for excluded lands, to which the company was not to have any right or title, the direction respecting the issue of patents necessarily carried with it the power and the duty of determining in every instance whether the land came within the terms of the grant, or, for any reason, was ex- \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 686]\n\u00a0\n cluded from it, and of giving appropriate effect to the result by granting or refusing a patent. This is the theory upon which the Land Department uniformly has proceeded in the administration and adjustment of this and other railroad land grants, and this court repeatedly has pronounced it the true theory. The departmental view and practice are shown in Central P. R. Co. v. Valentine, 11 Land Dec. 238, where it was said by Secretary Noble (p. 243): 'It is not questioned that the Land Department has jurisdiction until patent or certification, as the case may be, to the company, to determine whether any of the lands within the lateral limits of the grant had been, at the time the line of the road was definitely fixed, 'sold, reserved, or otherwise disposed of,' or was subject to 'a pre-emption or homestead claim,' and therefore excepted from the grant. That such jurisdiction exists there can be no doubt, and I am unable to perceive upon what principle of logic or process of reasoning it can be claimed that a like jurisdiction does not exist for the purpose of determining whether the lands are mineral, and for that reason excepted from the grant. Manifestly, the jurisdiction to determine the exception is the same, whether the inquiry is instituted as to the character of the land, or as to its particular status, at the date when the rights of the company attached under the grant.' Again (p. 244): 'All the lands within the primary limits of a railroad grant do not necessarily pass to the railroad, but only such as are not within the exceptions named in the grant, and Secretary of the Interior is clothed with the authority of determining in the first instance which lands pass by the grant and which do not pass, and this he does by approving lists for certification or patent.' And again (p. 246): 'Now, this jurisdiction is in the Land Department, and it continues, as we have seen, until the lands have been either patented or certified to, or for the use of, the railroad company. By reason of this jurisdic- \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 687]\n\u00a0\n tion it has been the practice of that Department, for many years past, to refuse to issue patents to railroad companies for lands found to be mineral in character at any time before the date of the patent.'\n The same subject came before this court in Barden v. Northern P. R. Co. \n154 U.S. 288\n, 38 L. ed. 992, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1030. The case arose under a grant (13 Stat. at L. 365, chap. 217) containing an exclusion of mineral lands, provisions for indemnity, and a direction for patents, identical with those now under consideration; the grant being followed by a joint resolution (13 Stat. at L. 567) which, referring to that and other grants made at the same session, declared that none 'shall be so construed as to embrace mineral lands, which in all cases shall be, and are, reserved exclusively to the United States, unless otherwise specially provided in the act or acts making the grant.' On the part of the railroad company it was insisted that the conditions existing when the line of railroad was definitely located should be taken as decisive of whether lands were mineral or otherwise wise in the sense of the mineral-land exclusion, and much apprehension was expressed lest a different ruling would put the matter so at large that a discovery of mineral at any time in the future would defeat titles supposedly complete. By leave of the court, the Solicitor General appeared on behalf of the government, and took the position shown by the following extract from his brief (\n154 U.S. 296\n-298; Brief, pp. 4-7):\n'The act itself provides for the issuing of patents to the railroad company, and contemplates, therefore, that the Secretary of the Interior, prior to such issue, shall determine whether the lands sought to be patented come within the terms of the grant; in other words, whether they are in odd sections, unappropriated, not mineral, etc.\n\n'But it is said that the Secretary of the Interior has no authority to patent mineral lands, and that a patent for \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 688]\n\u00a0\n lands in fact mineral would afford no protection to the railroad company in the event of the future discovery of precious metals therein. This is a mistake. After the Secretary of the Interior has decided that any particular lands are not mineral, and has issued a patent therefor, the title is not liable to be defeated by the subsequent discovery of minerals. The authorities upon this point are cited in Mr. Shields' original brief [ pp. 46 to 60].\n\n'The point is also covered by the case of Davis v. Wiebbold, \n139 U.S. 507\n, 35 L. ed. 238, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 628, where a patent was issued for a town site, and minerals were subsequently discovered in the lands patented. But it was held that the title was not affected by such discovery, and that the provision of the town-site act (Rev. Stat.  2392, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1459) that 'no title shall be acquired to any mine of gold, silver, cinnabar, or copper,' does not apply where the mines were discovered after a patent has been issued.\n\n'Mr. Justice Field, delivering the opinion of the court, quotes with approval, at page 521, the following language of Judge Sawyer in Cowell v. Lammers, 10 Sawy. 246, 257, 21 Fed. 200, 206: 'There must be some point of time when the character of the land must be finally determined, and, for the interest of all concerned, there can be no better point to determine this question than at the time of issuing the patent.'\n\n'And again, at page 523, he quotes with approval the following language of Mr. Justice Lamar while Secretary of the Interior [5 Land Dec. 194]: 'The issue of said patent was a determination by the proper tribunal that the lands covered by the patent were granted to said company, and hence, under the proviso of said act, were not mineral at the date of the issuance of said patent.'\n\n'And again, page 524: 'The grant or patent, when issued, would thus be held to carry with it the determination of the proper authorities that the land patented was not subject to the exception stated.' \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 689]\n\u00a0\n 'In Moore v. Smaw, 17 Cal. 199, 79 Am. Dec. 123, 12 Mor. Min. Rep. 418, it was decided, in the first opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Field as chief justice of the supreme court of California, that the patent of the United States passes title to minerals.\n\n'Of course, if the railroad company knows at the time of receiving a patent that the lands covered by it are mineral, a case of fraud is presented which entitles the Secretary of the Interior to have the patent canceled, as was done in Morton v. Nebraska, 21 Wall. 660, 22 L. ed. 639, 12 Mor. Min. Rep. 451, and in Western P. R. Co. v. United States, \n108 U.S. 510\n, 27 L. ed. 806, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 802. But, barring cases of fraud, the issuing of a patent by the Secretary of the Interior to the railroad company gives it an absolute title, not liable to be defeated by the subsequent discovery of minerals.\n\n'Here, then, is a method of adjusting the company's grant according to the procedure contemplated by the act itself, which protects fully the interest of both the government and the railroad, and which is in accordance with the practice which has always prevailed in the Department of the Interior.' Citing Secretary Noble's decision in Central P. R. Co. v. Valentine, supra.\n\n The court rejected the contention that the conditions existing at the date of definite location were decisive of whether the land was mineral or nonmineral, and held that the question remained an open one until the issue of a patent. In the latter connection the court referred to prior decisions respecting the power and duty of the Land Department, in issuing patents, to inquire and determine whether the lands are of the class prescribed, whether there are other claims to them, and whether the applicant is entitled to a transfer of the title; reaffirmed its ruling in St. Louis Smelting & Ref. Co. v. Kemp, \n104 \nU.S. 636, 640\n, 26 S. L. ed. 875, 876, 11 Mor. Min. Rep. 673, that a patent not only 'operates to pass the title, but is in the nature of an official declaration by that branch of the government to which the alienation of the public lands, under the law, is intrusted, that all the requirements preliminary \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 690]\n\u00a0\n to its issue have been complied with;' and further said (pp. 328, 329):\n'If the Land Department must decide what lands shall not be patented because reserved, sold, granted, or otherwise appropriated, or because not free from preemption or other claims or rights at the time the line of the road is definitely fixed, it must also decide whether lands are excepted because they are mineral lands. . . . If, as suggested by counsel, when the Secretary of the Interior has under consideration a list of lands to be patented to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, it is shown that part of said lands contain minerals of gold and silver, discovered since the company's location of its road opposite thereto, he would not perform his duty, stated in Knight v. United Land Asso. \n142 \nU.S. 161, 178\n, 35 S. L. ed. 974, 980, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 258, as the 'supervising agent of the government to do justice to all claims and preserve the rights of the people of the United States,' by certifying the list until corrected in accordance with the discoveries made known to the Department. . . .\n\n'There are undoubtedly many cases arising before the Land Department in the disposition of the public lands where it will be a matter of much difficulty on the part of its officers to ascertain with accuracy whether the lands to be disposed of are to be deemed mineral lands or agricultural lands, and in such cases the rule adopted that they will be considered mineral or agricultural, as they are more valuable in the one class or the other, may be sound. The officers will be governed by the knowledge of the lands obtained at the time as to their real character. The determination of the fact by those officers, that they are one or the other will be considered as conclusive.'\n\n And then, after quoting approvingly what we have already extracted from Secretary Noble's decision in Central P. R. Co. v. Valentine, supra, it was added (p. 330): 'It is true that the patent has been issued \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 691]\n\u00a0\n in many instances without the investigation and consideration which the public interest requires; but if that has been done without fraud, though unadvisedly by officers of the Government charged with the duty of supervising and attending to the preparation and issue of such patents, the consequence must be borne by the government until, by further legislation, a stricter regard to their duties in that respect can be enforced upon them.'\n Of the decision in that case it was concisely said in Shaw v. Kellogg, \n170 \nU.S. 312, 339\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1050, 1060, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 632: 'It is true there was a division of opinion, but that division was only as to the time at which and the means by which the nonmineral character of the land was settled. The minority were of the opinion that the question was settled at the time of the filing of the map of definite location. The majority, relying on the language in the original act of 1864, making the grant, and also on the joint resolution of January 30, 1865, which expressly declared that such grant should not be 'construed as to embrace mineral lands, which in all cases shall be and are reserved exclusively to the United States,' held that the question of mineral or nonmineral was open to consideration up to the time of issuing a patent. But there was no division of opinion as to the question that when the legal title did pass,- and it passed unquestionably by the patent,-it passed free from the contingency of future discovery of minerals.'\n The exclusion of mineral lands is not confined to railroad land grants, but appears in the homestead, desert-land, timber and stone, and other public-land laws, and the settled course of decision in respect of all of them has been that the character of the land is a question for the Land Department, the same as are the qualifications of the applicant and his performance of the acts upon which the right to receive the title depends, and that when a patent issues it is to be taken, upon a collateral attack, as affording conclusive evidence of the nonmineral character of \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 692]\n\u00a0\n the land and of the regularity of the acts and proceedings resulting in its issue, and, upon a direct attack, as affording such presumptive evidence thereof as to require plain and convincing proof to overcome it. St. Louis Smelting & Ref. Co. v. Kemp, \n104 \nU.S. 636, 641\n, 26 S. L. ed. 875, 876, 11 Mor. Min. Rep. 673; Steel v. St. Louis Smelting & Ref. Co. \n106 U.S. 447\n, 27 L. ed. 226, 1 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 1018\n\n\n In this respect no distinction is recognized between patents issued under railroad land grants and those issued under other laws; nor is there any reason for such a distinction.\n Of course, if the land officers are induced by false proofs to issue a patent for mineral lands under a nonmineral-land law, or if they issue such a patent fraudulently or through a mere inadvertence, a bill in equity, on the part of the government, will lie to annul the patent and regain the title, or a mineral claimant who then had acquired such rights in the land as to entitle him to protection may maintain a bill to have the patentee declared a trustee for him; but such a patent is merely voidable, not void, and cannot be successfully attacked by strangers who had no interest in the land at the time the patent was issued, and were not prejudiced by it. Colorado Coal & I. Co. v. United States, \n123 \nU.S. 307, 313\n, 31 S. L. ed. 182, 185, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 131; Diamond Coal & Coke Co. v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 236, 239\n, 58 S.

In the last case this court said, speaking through Chief Justice Marshall: 'It is not doubted that a patent appropriates land. Any defects in the preliminary steps which are required by law are cured by the patent. It is a title from its date, and has always been held conclusive against all those whose rights did not commence previous to its emanation. . . . If the patent has been issued irregularly, the government \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 693]\n\u00a0\n may provide means for repealing it; but no individual has a right to annul it, to consider the land as still vacant, and to appropriate it to himself.' Of the same import are Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173, 182, 15 L. ed. 338, 341: Spencer v. Lapsley, 20 How. 264, 273, 15 L. ed. 902, 906; Ehrhardt v. Hogaboom, \n115 \nU.S. 67, 68\n, 29 S. L. ed. 346, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1157.\n The patent here in question was issued July 10, 1894. Apparently, the government never brought a bill to have it vacated or annulled, and the time for doing so apparently expired in 1900 or 1901. Acts March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. at L. 1093, chap. 559, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1531; March 2, 1896, 29 Stat. at L. 42, chap. 39,  1, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1603; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co. \n209 \nU.S. 447, 450\n, 52 S. L. ed. 881, 887, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 579. Apparently, also, the prior mineral claimants never sought to have the patentee declared a trustee for them, for it is admitted that they abandoned their locations. The present mineral claimants, who are assailing the patent, claim under relocations made in March, 1909, more than fourteen years after the date of the patent, and eight years after the apparent expiration of the time within which the government could ask that it be vacated or annulled. Plainly, there is no privity between the earlier and later mineral claimants, for the relocations were not made in furtherance of the prior locations, but in hostility to them. See Rev. Stat.  2324, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1426.\n But, referring to the clause in the patent, 'excluding and excepting all mineral lands should any such be found in the tracts aforesaid,' the contention is made, first, that the patent shows that the Land Department did not consider or determine whether the lands were mineral or not, and, second, that all lands embraced in the patent which then had been or thereafter should be discovered to be mineral were expressly excepted from the operation of the patent and therefore remained public lands. This contention must be tested in the light of the established practice in the Land Department in such matters and of the office which the granting act intended the patents to perform. The clause relied upon is not peculiar to this \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 694]\n\u00a0\n patent or to those issued under this grant, but appears in all the patents issued from 1866 to 1904 under railroad land grants containing an exclusion of mineral lands. Its first mention in any public document was in the annual report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office for 1868. It was there said (pp. 152-154):\n'In every case reported from the district land officers of selections made under the acts of 1862 and 1864 [12 Stat. at L. 492, chap. 120, 13 Stat. at L. 358, chap. 216] for the Pacific Railroad, the agent of the company in the first instance is required to state in his affidavit that the selections are not interdicted, mineral, nor reserved lands, and are of the character contemplated by the grant. Upon the filing of lists with such affidavits attached, it is made the duty of registers and receivers to certify to the correctness of the selections in the particulars mentioned and in other respects. They subsequently undergo scrutiny in this office, are tested by our plats, and by all the data on our files, sufficient time elapsing after the selections are made for the presentation of any objections to the Department before final action is taken; and to more effectually guard the matter, there is inserted in all patents issued to said railroad company a clause to the following effect: 'Yet excluding and excepting from the transfer by these presents all mineral lands, should any such be found to exist in the tracts described in this patent, this exception, as required by statute, not extending to coal and iron land.' . . . It has been suggested to this office that the government should appoint a commission to segregate the mineral from the residue of the public lands; but let anyone consider the vast amount of money expended by practical miners in excavations to test the value of mines, subsequently abandoned as worthless, and some idea may be formed of the time and expense such an undertaking would require, and how little confidence it would be likely to inspire. . . . The regulation of filing affidavits is simply a means of ascertaining the class \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 695]\n\u00a0\n to which a particular tract of land may belong, and although it may not be the best that could be devised, it is the only practical mode that has suggested itself to meet the difficulty of disposing of different classes of land mingled together in such a way as to render it frequently impossible to tell, without great labor and expense, whether a particular subdivision belongs to one or the other class.'\n\n In addition to what was thus said respecting the affidavits and certificates required and the examination of whatever data were available, regulations were promulgated calling attention, among other things, to the mineral-land exclusion in the grants, directing that the lists be carefully and critically examined by the register and receiver, and mineral lands be excluded therefrom, and prescribing forms of affidavits and certificates reciting, among other things, that the listed lands were nonmineral and of the character contemplated by the grant. \n2\n It also appears from the published land decisions that hearings were often had in the local land offices to determine whether lands sought to be listed were mineral or otherwise, and that appeals in such matters were not infrequently heard by the Secretary of the Interior. \n3\n From all this it is manifest that the excepting clause never was intended to take the place of an inquiry into the character of the land, or to dispense with a determination of that question, and that its presence in the patents does not at all signify that no inquiry or determination was had. On the contrary, it appears that it was the accustomed practice to exact proofs respecting the character of the \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 696]\n\u00a0\n land, to give opportunity for contests, and to give effect to whatever information was obtained. At most, according to the Commissioner's report, the clause was intended to serve merely as an additional safeguard; and its words suggest that its use was with an eye to future discoveries rather than to existing conditions.\n Coming to its effect in a patent, which is of more importance than how it came to be there, we find that this question came before the Land Department in the case of Re Spong, 5 Land Dec. 193. The tract in question had been patented to the Central Pacific Railroad Company under its grant, the patent containing the excepting clause. Spong applied at the local land office to enter the tract under the mining law, claiming that it was mineral and therefore excepted from the patent. The local officers refused his application, assigning as a reason that the title had passed to the company under the patent, and the Commissioner of the General Land Office affirmed their decision. The matter was then taken before Secretary Lamar, who sustained the decisions below, saying (p. 194): 'The issue of said patent was a determination by the proper tribunal that the lands covered by the patent were granted to said company, and hence, under the proviso of said act, were not mineral at the date of the issuance of said patent.' Again (p. 195): 'In the case of Deffeback v. Hawke, \n115 U.S. 393\n, 29 L. ed. 424, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 95, the court reviewed and commented on the several acts of Congress relative to the disposition of mineral lands, and held that the officers of the Land Department have no authority to insert in a patent any other terms than those of conveyance, with recitals showing a compliance with the law and the conditions which it prescribed.' And again (p. 196): 'While the exception of mineral lands from the grant to said company is clear and explicit, yet it does not appear from a careful consideration of the language of said grant that Congress intended to grant only such lands as may, \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 697]\n\u00a0\n after the lapse of an indefinite number of years, prove to be agricultural in character.' The question was also presented in Courtright v. Wisconsin C. R. Co. 19 Land Dec. 410. The land involved had been patented under a railroad land grant like that now before us, the patent containing the same exception. Courtright, claiming that the land was mineral, and was known to be such since before the patent, insisted that it remain public land, and sought to make entry of it. The local officers held that this could not be done in the presence of the patent, and their ruling was sustained by the Commissioner. On appeal, Secretary Smith affirmed the action of the other officers, saying (p. 413):\n'The issuing of patent is a determination by the Department that the lands embraced therein are of the character described in the grant.\n\n ... * *\n'If it was the intention of the officers of the government to leave as an open question the character of the lands embraced in the patent, then they acted without authority; for when patent issued, that was the end of the jurisdiction of the Department over the lands. The exception contained in the patent went beyond 'giving expression to the intent of the statute,' as construed by the supreme court, and added a restriction upon the grant which is not to be found in the granting act.\n\n'I am therefore of the opinion that the Department has not jurisdiction to determine the character of the land in controversy after issuance of patent. If it be true that the lands in question contain minerals in paying quantities, and that this fact was known to the officers or agents of the company at the date of selection, or date of patent, and they failed to make the fact known to the Department, such conduct was a fraud upon the government, and the courts can grant relief.'\n\n It thus appears that the Land Department has regarded \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 698]\n\u00a0\n the issuing of such a patent as a determination of the nonmineral character of the land, and as effectually and unconditionally passing the title. There has been no departmental decision to the contrary. Indeed, on December 10, 1903, the Secretary of the Interior directed that the excepting clause be omitted from future patents, because he regarded it as without any warrant in law and void. Re Northern P. R. Co. 32 Land Dec. 342.\n This clause was extensively considered by Circuit Judge Sawyer in Cowell v. Lammers, 10 Sawy. 246, 21 Fed. 200. The patent in that case had been issued under the Central Pacific grant. The suit was to enjoin a trespass in the nature of waste, the complainant being the grantee of the railroad company and the defendant a miner who had located part of the patented tract as a lode mining claim. He had applied to the Land Department to enter the claim under the mining law, and his application had been rejected because the patent was outstanding. In granting the injunction the court said (p. 206): 'The lands are either patentable under the act or they are not. If patentable, the issue of a patent is authorized. If not patentable, it is unauthorized, and the issue of a patent is, clearly, as conclusive evidence of the determination of the fact of patentability, upon a collateral attack, in the one case as in the other. Suppose it should afterwards turn out that all is mineral land. The exception would be as broad as the grant, and be void as an exception. Is it any the less so, in this class of cases, as to a part? . . . There must be some point in time when the character of the land must be finally determined; and, for the interest of all concerned, there can be no better point to determine this question than at the time of issuing the patent.' Again (p. 208): 'A patent upon its face should either grant or not grant. It must be seen from a construction of the language of the grant [patent] itself whether anything is granted or not, and, if anything be granted, what \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 699]\n\u00a0\n it is. There is no authority to issue a patent which, in effect, only says if the lands herein described hereafter turn out to be agricultural lands, then I grant them, but if they turn out to be mineral lands, then I do not grant them. Such a patent would be so uncertain that it would be impossible to determine, from the face of the patent, whether anything is granted or not.'\n In principle, the effect of the excepting clause in the patent is not an open one, under the decisions of this court. It is foreclosed by what has been held upon full consideration. In Deffeback v. Hawke, \n115 U.S. 392\n, 29 L. ed. 424, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 95, where was involved the right to certain valuable town-site improvements upon land patented as a placer mining claim, the contention was advanced that, as the owner of the improvements was the prior occupant, the patent should have contained a reservation excluding them and all rights necessary to their enjoyment from its operation; but the contention was declared untenable, the court saying (p. 406): 'The land officers, who are merely agents of the law, had no authority to insert in the patent any other terms than those of conveyance, with recitals showing a compliance with the law and the conditions which it prescribed.' The case of Davis v. Wiebbold, \n139 U.S. 507\n, 35 L. ed. 238, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 628, directly involved the validity of a clause in a town-site patent declaring that no title should be thereby 'acquired to any mine of gold, silver, cinnabar, or copper.' By the mining laws mineral lands were withdrawn from disposal under other laws, and the town-site law specially declared that no title to any mine of gold, silver, cinnabar, or copper should be acquired under its provisions. The defendant claimed under the town-site patent and a deed of release and quitclaim from the probate judge, who was the town-site trustee, and the plaintiff claimed under a later patent for a mining claim located upon part of the town site, and based upon an actual discovery of a valuable vein of gold after the issue of the town-site patent. \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 700]\n\u00a0\n The decision and the reasons for it are fully comprehended in the following extracts from the opinion:\n (P. 519.) 'The exceptions of mineral lands from pre-emption and settlement and from grants to states for universities and schools, for the construction of public buildings, and in aid of railroads and other works of internal improvement, are not held to exclude all lands in which minerals may be found, but only those where the mineral is in sufficient quantity to add to their richness and to justify expenditures for its extraction, and known to be so at the date of the grant.' (As shown in Barden v. Northern P. R. Co. \n154 U.S. 288\n, 38 L. ed. 992, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1030, the word 'grant' here means the patent, and not the act making the grant.)\n (P. 524.) 'It would seem from this uniform construction of that department4 of the government specially intrusted with supervision of proceedings required for the alienation of the public lands, including those that embrace minerals, and also of the courts of the mining states, Federal and state, whose attention has been called to the subject, that the exception of mineral lands from grant in the acts of Congress should be considered to apply only to such lands as were at the time of the grant [ patent] known to be so valuable for their minerals as to justify expenditure for their extraction. The grant or patent, when issued, would thus be held to carry with it the determination of the proper authorities that the land patented was not subject to the exception stated. There Las been no direct adjudication upon this point by this court, but this conclusion is a legitimate inference from several of its decisions. It was implied in the opinion in Deffeback v. Hawke, already referred to, and in the cases of the Colorado Coal & I. Co. v. United States, \n123 \nU.S. 307, 328\n, 31 S. L. ed. 182, 190, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 131, and United States v. Iron Silver Min. Co. \n128 \nU.S. 673, 683\n, 32 S. L. ed. 571, 575, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 195.' \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 701]\n\u00a0\n (P. 525.) 'It would in many instances be a great impediment to the progress of such towns if the titles to the lots occupied by their inhabitants were subject to be overthrown by a subsequent discovery of mineral deposits under their surface. If their title would not protect them against a discovery of mines in them, neither would it protect them against the invasion of their property for the purpose of exploring for mines. The temptation to such exploration would be according to the suspected extent of the minerals, and being thus subject to indiscriminate invasion, the land would be to one having the title poor and valueless, just in proportion to the supposed richness and abundance of its products. We do not think that any such results were contemplated by the act of Congress, or that any construction should be given to the provision in question which could lead to such results.'\n (Pp. 527, 528.) 'But we do not attach any importance to the exception, for the officers of the Land Department, being merely agents of the government, have no authority to insert in a patent any other terms than those of conveyance, with recitals showing compliance with the conditions which the law prescribes. Could they insert clauses in patents at their own discretion they could limit or enlarge their effect without warrant of law. The patent of a mining claim carries with it such rights to the land which includes the claim as the law confers, and no others, and these rights can neither be enlarged nor diminished by any reservations of the officers of the Land Department, resting for their fitness only upon the judgment of those officers. Deffeback v. Hawke, \n115 \nU.S. 392, 406\n, 29 S. L. ed. 423, 427, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 95. . . . The laws of Congress provide that valuable mineral deposits in lands of the United States shall be open to exploration and purchase. They do not provide, and never have provided, that such mineral deposits in lands which have ceased to be public, and become the property of \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 702]\n\u00a0\n private individuals, can be patented under any proceedings before the Land Department, or otherwise.'\n The case of Shaw v. Kellogg, \n170 U.S. 312\n, 42 L. ed. 1050, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 632, related to a claim or right, conferred by statute, entitling its owner to select in a body about 100,000 acres 'of vacant land, not mineral,' in New Mexico, it being the duty of the Surveyor General 'to make survey and location of the lands so selected,' and his action being subject to the supervision of the Commissioner of the General Land Office. The owner of the right, having made the selection, applied to the Surveyor General in 1862 for the survey and location of the tract, and that officer reported the application to the Commissioner, saying in that connection that he had theretofore been informed that the purpose of the owner was to make such a selection as 'would cover rich minerals in the mountains.' The Commissioner replied that it was essential to the approval of the application by him that 'it be accompanied by the certificates of the Surveyor General and the register and receiver that the land selected is vacant and not mineral.' Such certificates were furnished, but the Commissioner hesitated to act upon them because they were not based upon personal knowledge, but information informally elicited from others, the lands being remote and in an unsurveyed region. Finally, the Commissioner concluded that 'the difficulty' could 'be avoided' by directing the Surveyor General to proceed, and in approving the survey to add to his certificate of approval 'the special reservation stipulated by the statute, but not to embrace mineral land.' Being instructed accordingly, the Surveyor General, after the field notes and plat of the survey were completed, indorsed upon the field notes a mere approval, and upon the plat an approval qualified by the words, 'subject to the conditions and limitations' of the statute, naming it. The field notes and plat were then forwarded to and accepted by the Commis- \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 703]\n\u00a0\n sioner. No patent was issued, the approved survey taking the place of one under the statute. A few years later, when inquiries were made respecting the right of prospectors to take advantage of mineral discoveries in the tract, the Commissioner took the position that the approval of the survey operated as a determination that the land was of the class and character designated in the act; that the title had passed from the government, and that, notwithstanding the apparently conditional approval, the Land Department was without authority to reopen the question of the character of the land. The case, as presented to this court, involved the possession of a mine located within the tract after the approval of the survey. The plaintiff claimed under the selection of 1862 and the defendant under the mining laws, the controversy turning upon the effect to be given to the condition in the approval of the survey. In disposing of that question the court reaffirmed and applied its rulings in Deffeback v. Hawke and Barden v. Northern P. R. Co. supra, and said (p. 337):\n'What is the significance of, and what effect can be given to, the clause inserted in the certificate of approval of the plat that it was subject to the conditions and provisions of the act of Congress? We are of opinion that the insertion of any such stipulation and limitation was beyond the power of the Land Department. Its duty was to decide, and not to decline to decide; to execute, and not to refuse to execute, the will of Congress. It could not deal with the land as an owner and prescribe the conditions upon which title might be transferred. It was an agent, and not principal. Congress had made a grant, authorized a selection within three years, and directed the Surveyor General to make survey and location, and within the general powers of the Land Department it was its duty to see that such grant was carried into effect and that a full title to the proper land was made. Un- \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 704]\n\u00a0\n doubtedly it could refuse to approve a location on the ground that the land was mineral. It was its duty to decide the question,-a duty which it could not avoid or evade. It could not say to the locator that it approved the location provided no mineral should ever thereafter be discovered, and disapproved it if mineral were discovered; in other words, that the locator must take the chances of future discovery of minerals. It was a question for its action, and its action at the time. The general statutes of Congress in respect to homestead, pre-emption, and town-site locations provide that they should be made upon lands that are nonmineral, and in approving any such entry and issuing a patent therefor could it be tolerated for a moment that the Land Department might limit the grant and qualify the title by a stipulation that if thereafter mineral should be discovered the title should fail? It cannot in that way avoid the responsibility of deciding and giving to the party seeking to make the entry a full title to the land, or else denying it altogether.'\n\n (P. 341.) 'But, it is said, no patent was issued in this case, and therefore the holding in the Barden Case, that the issue of a patent puts an end to all questions, does not apply here. But the significance of a patent is that it is evidence of the transfer of the legal title. There is no magic in the word 'patent,' or in the instrument which the word defines. By it the legal title passes, and when, by whatsoever instrument, and in whatsoever manner, that is accomplished, the same result follows as though a formal patent were issued.'\n (P. 343) 'While the approval entered upon the plat by the Surveyor General under the direction of the Land Department was in terms 'subject to the conditions and provisions of  6 of the act of Congress, approved June 21, 1860' [12 Stat. at L. 72, chap. 167], such limitation was beyond the power of executive officers to impose.'\n According to the statute relating to placer mining claims \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 705]\n\u00a0\n the patent, save in an instance not material here, should contain an exception of any vein or lodeknown to exist within the boundaries of the claim at the date of the application for patent, but in the early patents the exception was so stated that it embraced any vein or lode claimed or known to exist at the date of the patent. The change was a material one, not only because of the difference between 'claimed' and 'known,' but also because a year or so sometimes elapsed between the date of the application and that of the patent, and in the meantime a vein or lode might be discovered within the boundaries of the placer claim. Ultimately cases presenting the question of the effect of the exception as stated in the patents came before this court, and it was held that 'the exception of the statute cannot be extended by those whose duty it is to supervise the issuing of the patent.' Sullivan v. Iron Silver Min. Co. \n143 \nU.S. 431, 441\n, 36 S. L. ed. 214, 217, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 555, and cases cited.\n These decisions are applicable and controlling here. The reasoning upon which they proceed compels their reaffirmance; and, besides, they have come to be recognized as establishing a rule of property. Not only has the Land Department accepted them as determinative of the invalidity of the excepting clause now before us, but innumerable titles within the limits of the western railroad land grants have been acquired with a like understanding and are now held in the justifiable belief that they are impregnable.\n We come now to a contention which seeks to distinguish patents under this grant from those under other railroad grants. It is that the insertion of the excepting clause in the former was expressly authorized by Congress. Evidently this has not been the view of the Land Department. It not only began to use the clause before this grant was made, but used it in all patents of this class; and when, in December, 1903, its use was discontinued, the order embraced this grant along with the others. But passing \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 706]\n\u00a0\n this as suggestive but not controlling, we turn to the joint resolution of June 28, 1870, upon which the contention is rested. Its chief purpose was to sanction a route which the Secretary of the Interior had disapproved. Southern P. R. Co. v. United States, \n183 \nU.S. 519, 523\n, 46 S. L. ed. 307, 310, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 154. It reads as follows (16 Stat. at L. 382, No. 87):\n'That the Southern Pacific Railroad Company of California may construct its road and telegraph line, as near as may be, on the route indicated by the map filed by said company in the Department of the Interior on the third day of January, eighteen hundred and sixty-seven; and upon the construction of each section of said road, in the manner and within the time provided by law, and notice thereof being given by the company to the Secretary of the Interior, he shall direct an examination of each such section by commissioners to be appointed by the President, as provided in the act making a grant of land to said company, approved July twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred and sixty-six [14 Stat. at L. 299, chap. 278], and upon the report of the commissioners to the Secretary of the Interior that such section of said railroad and telegraph line has been constructed as required by law, it shall be the duty of the said Secretary of the Interior to cause patents to be issued to said company for the sections of land coterminous to each constructed section reported on as aforesaid, to the extent and amount granted to said company by the said act of July twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, expressly saving and reserving all the rights of actual settlers, together with the other conditions and restrictions provided for in the third section of said act.'\n\n It will be observed that there is no direct mention of mineral lands, nor any indirect reference to them save such as is involved in the general mention of the 'conditions and restrictions' of  3 of the granting act.\n As stated in one of the briefs, the contention is this: 'The resolution provided in express terms that these \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 707]\n\u00a0\n patents should cover all of the lands coterminous with the constructed sections of the railroad, and in effect provided that the patents should save and reserve the lands excepted by the provisions of  3 of the original granting act, which included the exception of mineral lands.' In other words, it is meant that the resolution required that all the oddnumbered sections within the primary limits of the grant, and coterminous with the constructed road, should be patented to the railroad company without any inquiry or investigation to determine which of those sections were sold, reserved, occupied by homestead settlers, pre-empted, or otherwise disposed of at the date of definite location, or were mineral, and that a general exception conforming to that in the granting act was to be inserted in the patents. This would mean that lands already sold were to be patented to the company, that reserved lands were to be patented to it, that lands occupied by homestead settlers or pre-empted were to be dealt with in the same way; in short, that the grant, instead of being administered and adjusted in an orderly way by the officers customarily charged with that duty and in possession of the records and data without which little could be done, was to be administered and adjusted in the courts through the ordinary channels of litigation. Manifestly, that is not what Congress contemplated. It did not intend that the company's title should be so uncertain, and clearly it did not intend that the title to lands already sold or those reserved should be thus beclouded, or that homesteaders and preemptioners should be placed in a situation which would be so embarrassing and discouraging to them. What would become of the indemnity provisions under that theory? Certainly, it was not intended that the company should receive a patent for lands in the place limits and also indemnity for the same lands. We think there is a more reasonable view of the provision in the resolution than the one suggested. Omit- \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 708]\n\u00a0\n ting its saving clause, the provision is not materially different from  4 of the original act, being the section providing for patents. As already said, the chief purpose of the resolution was to sanction a route-the one indicated on the map mentioned. The Secretary of the Interior had disapproved it because not within prior authorization. If it was to be approved, it was but reasonable that the existing right to the patents should be applied to it. This evidently is what was intended. Another matter also claimed consideration. Three years had passed since the filing of the map, and in the meantime the situation had been complicated by a withdrawal of the adjacent lands, a revocation of the withdrawal, and a suspension of the revoking order. The validity of the route shown on the map and of the withdrawal had been the subject of differing opinions, and some of the lands had come to be occupied by settlers, whose status was uncertain in view of the withdrawal. See 16 Ops. Atty. Gen. 80. As reported to the Senate by one of its committees, the resolution was in its present form without the saving clause. That was added when the resolution was under consideration. \n5\n Without it the resolution had two purposes; one, to sanction the route which had been pronounced unauthorized, and the other, to make secure the right to patents along that route. What was the purpose of the saving clause? Its words and the situation just mentioned leave no doubt that one purpose was to take care of the actual settlers then on the lands. Another, equally plain, was to require that the conditions and restrictions, that is, the exclusions and exceptions, of  3 (the granting section) of the original act, be applied to that route. But how were these purposes to be accomplished? Was it to be by patenting all the lands to the railroad company, even those occupied by \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 709]\n\u00a0\n actual settlers, and inserting saving clauses in the patents? Or was it to be by giving effect to the rights of the settlers and to the exclusions and exceptions in the normal and rational way; that is, by patenting to the company no lands occupied by actual settlers or otherwise excluded or excepted from the grant? The latter seems to us the only admissible conclusion. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Lastly, it is urged that the railroad company accepted the patent with the mineral exception therein, and also expressly agreed that the latter should be effective as one of the terms of the patent, and so is bound by it, or at least estopped to deny its validity. There are insuperable objections to this contention. The terms of the patent whereby the government transfers its title to public land are not open to negotiation or agreement. The patentee has no voice in the matter. It in no wise depends upon his consent or will. He must abide the action of those whose duty and responsibility are fixed by law. Neither can the land officers enter into any agreement upon the subject. They are not principals, but agents of the law, and must heed only its will. Deffeback v. Hawke, \n115 \nU.S. 392, 406\n, 29 S. L. ed. 423, 427, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 95; Davis v. Wiebbold, \n139 \nU.S. 507, 527\n, 35 S. L. ed. 238, 245, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 628; Shaw v. Kellogg, \n170 \nU.S. 312, 337\n, 343 S., 42 L. ed. 1050, 1059, 1061, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 632. Nor can they indirectly give effect to what is unauthorized when done directly. Of course, if they enter into any forbidden arrangement whereby public land is transferred to one not entitled to it, the patent may be annulled at the suit of the government; but they cannot alter the effect which the law gives to a patent while it is out standing.\n Taking up the several questions in the light of what we have here said, we answer them as follows:\n\n 1. \nDid the said grant to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company include mineral lands which were known to \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 710]\n\u00a0\n be such at or prior to the date of the patent of July 10, 1894?\n Answer.-Mineral lands, known to be such at or prior to the issue of patent, were not included in the grant, but excluded from it, and the duty of determining the character of the lands was cast primarily on the Land Department, which was charged with the issue of patents.\n\n 2. \nDoes a patent to a railroad company under a grant which excludes mineral lands, as in the present case, but which is issued without any investigation upon the part of the officers of the Land Office or of the Department of the Interior as to the quality of the land, whether agricultural or mineral, and without hearing upon or determination of the quality of the lands, operate to convey lands which are thereafter ascertained to be mineral?\n Answer.-A patent issued in such circumstances is irregularly issued, undoubtedly so; but, as it is the act of a legally constituted tribunal, and is done within its jurisdiction, it is not void, and therefore passes the title (Noble v. Union River Logging R. Co. \n147 \nU.S. 165, 174\n, 175 S., 37 L. ed. 123, 126, 127, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 271), subject to the right of the government to attack the patent by a direct suit for its annulment if the land was known to be mineral when the patent issued (McLaughlin v. United States, \n107 U.S. 526\n, 27 L. ed. 621, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 862; Western P. R. Co. v. United States, \n108 U.S. 510\n, 27 L. ed. 806, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 802).\n\n 3. \nIs the reservation and exception contained in the grant in the patent to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company void and of no effect?\n Answer.-The mineral land exception in the patent is void.\n\n 4. \nIf the reservation of mineral lands as expressed in the patent is void, then is the patent, upon a collateral attack, a conclusive and official declaration that the land is agricultural, and that all the requirements preliminary to the issuance of the patent have been complied with?\n Answer.-It is conclusive upon a collateral attack. \n\n[234 U.S. 669, 711]\n\u00a0\n 5. Is petroleum or mineral oil within the meaning of the term 'mineral,' as it was used in said acts of Congress reserving mineral land from the railroad land grants?\n Answer.-Petroleum lands are mineral lands within the meaning of that term in railroad land grants.\n\n 6. \nDoes the fact that the appellant was not in privity with the government in any respect at the time when the patent was issued to the railroad company prevent him from attacking the patent on the ground of fraud, error, or irregularity in the issuance thereof as so alleged in the bill?\n Answer.-It does.\n\n 7. \nIf the mineral exception clause was inserted in the patent with the consent of the defendant, Southern Pacific Railroad Company, and under an understanding and agreement between it and the officers of the Interior Department that said clause should be effective to keep in the United States title to such of the lands described in the patent as were in fact mineral, are the defendants, Southern Pacific Railroad Company and the Kern Trading & Oil Company, estopped to deny the validity of said clause?\n Answer.-No; such an agreement is of no greator force as an estoppel than the exception in the patent. The latter being void, the patent passes the title and is not open to collateral attack, or to attack by strangers whose only claim was initiated after the issue of the patent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Circular July 15, 1873, Copp's Mineral Lands, 61; Letter of Commissioner Burdett, January 30, 1875, Sickles's Mining Laws, 491; Maxwell v.

Marcellus Geeen, Garner Wynn Green, and Marcellus Green, Jr., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 124, 126]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lovick P. Miles, Luke E. Wright, Sam P. Walker, and Roane Waring for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 124, 128]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Action for libel brought in the circuit court of Hinds county, first district, state of Mississippi. Plaintiff in error (as he was plaintiff in the action, we will so refer to him), alleged himself to be a citizen of the state of Mississippi; that defendant in error, Commercial Publishing Company (referred to herein as defendant), published a libel against him in its 'newspaper called the Commercial Appeal, in the city of Memphis, state of Tennessee, but that the said Commercial Appeal has a large circulation throughout the state of Mississippi and of adjoining states and among foreign cities, and also in foreign countries.' $10,000 actual damages were prayed and $10,000 punitive damages.\n Summons was issued and returned, served by the sheriff of the county, as: 'Executed personally on the Commercial Publishing Company' by delivering a copy to E. K. Williams, described as 'its agent, at Jackson, Mississippi,' and to A. C. Walthall, described as 'its correspondent, at Jackson, Mississippi.'\n Defendant filed a petition for removal of the action to the district court of the United States, which petition stated the nature of the action, that plaintiff was a resident and citizen of Mississippi, that defendant was a corporation chartered under and by virtue of the laws of Tennessee, that the time for answering or pleading to the declaration had not expired, that defendant had not appeared therein, and that defendant appeared only specially, and for the sole purpose of requesting the removal of the cause to the district court of the United States, and that it did not waive any objections or exceptions to the jurisdiction. A bond, as required by law, was duly given, which was approved, and an order of removal was duly made. The copy of the record was duly filed in the \n\n[232 U.S. 124, 129]\n\u00a0\n district court of the United States. The defendant then filed in the latter court a plea to the jurisdiction over the person of defendant, appearing specially for that purpose. The plea alleged that the state court had not acquired jurisdiction of the defendant, because (a) it was a corporation of the state of Tennessee, and that it had never taken out a license to do business in Mississippi, nor, at the time of the service of the summons, did it have an agent, office, or place of business in Hinds county, state of Mississippi; (b) the persons upon whom service was made were neither agents nor officers of, nor in any relation to, defendant, for the reason that defendant was not doing business in the state of Mississippi.\n Plaintiff demurred to the plea, stating as grounds (1) that it was directed to the service of process, and not to the declaration, as required under  29 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1095, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 142]; (2) no right exists to enter a special appearance in the Hinds county circuit court under the laws of the state of Mississippi, all appearances being general, even though process be invalidly served.\n The demurrer was overruled and issue joined on the plea to the jurisdiction, and the court, having heard the evidence, decided that neither of the persons upon whom summons was served was such an agent of defendant that service upon him would give jurisdiction over the person of defendant, and thereupon found the issue for defendant.\n Before judgment was entered, plaintiff called up his motion for judgment for default because defendant had not pleaded or demurred to the declaration within thirty days after the filing of the copy of the record of removal, as required by  29 of the Judicial Code. The motion was overruled, the court reciting in its order that it was of 'opinion that defendant was not required to plead or demur to the declaration unless the process of summons in the state court was duly served upon an agent of defend- \n\n[232 U.S. 124, 130]\n\u00a0\n ant upon whom service of process was authorized to be made.'\n Judgment was then entered, quashing the service of process and dismissing the action 'without prejudice to the right of plaintiff to sue upon the causes of action set up in the declaration.'\n Plaintiff prayed a writ of error to this court upon the question of jurisdiction. It was allowed in open court, the court reciting that it was allowed on the question of jurisdiction only, the court having dismissed the action 'on the sole question that the court had no jurisdiction of the action.'\n The question in the case is the simple one of what is the effect of  29 and 38 of the Judicial Code. Section 29 provides for the filing of a petition for the removal of a suit from a state court to the district court of the United States at any time before the defendant is required by the laws of the state to answer or plead, and the filing therewith of a bond for 'entering in such district court, within thirty days from the date of filing said petition, a certified copy of the record in such suit.' It provides that, this being done, the state court shall accept the petition and bond and 'proceed no further in such suit.' It provides further that notice of the petition and bond shall be given to the adverse party, and that 'the said copy being entered within said thirty days, as aforesaid, in said district court of the United States, the parties so removing the said cause shall, within thirty days thereafter, plead, answer, or demur to the declaration or complaint in said cause, and the cause shall then proceed in the same manner as if it had been originally commenced in the said district court.'\n Section 38 provides that the district court, in suits so removed, shall 'proceed therein as if the suit had been originally commenced in said district court and the same proceedings had been taken in such suit in said \n\n[232 U.S. 124, 131]\n\u00a0\n district court as shall have been had therein in said state court prior to its removal.'\n The argument is that these sections abolish the practice declared in Goldey v. Morning News, \n156 U.S. 518\n, 39 L. ed. 517, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 559, and Wabash Western R. Co. v. Brow, \n164 U.S. 271\n, 41 L. ed. 431, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 126. In the former case the following propositions were laid down : (1) The right and procedure of removal of actions from a state court are to be determined by the Federal law. (2) The legislature or the judiciary of a state can neither defeat the right nor limit its effect. (3) The act of Congress by which the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding in actions at law in the courts of the United States are required to conform as near as may be to those existing in the state courts applies only to cases of which the court has jurisdiction according to the Constitution and laws of the United States. (4) A suit must be actually pending in a state court before it can be removed, but its removal to the court of the United States does not admit that it was rightfully pending in the state court, or that the defendant could have been compelled to answer therein; but enables the defendant to avail himself in the United States court of any and every defense duly and seasonably reserved and pleaded to the action \"in the same manner as if it had been originally commenced in said circuit court.\" The words quoted, it will be observed, are repeated in  29, 'district court' being substituted for 'circuit court.'\n In Wabash Western R. Co. v. Brow, \n164 \nU.S. 271, 279\n, 41 S. L. ed. 431, 434, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 126, it is said: 'By the exercise of the right or removal, the petitioner refuses to permit the state court to deal with the case in any way, because he prefers another forum to which the law gives him the right to resort. This may be said the to challenge the jurisdiction of the state court, in the sense of declining to submit to it, and not necessarily otherwise.\n'We are of opinion that the filing of a petition for \n\n[232 U.S. 124, 132]\n\u00a0\n removal does not amount to a general appearance, but to a special appearance only.'\n\n Subsequent cases have applied this ruling. Mechanical Appliance Co. v. Castleman, \n215 U.S. 437\n, 54 L. ed. 272, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 125, and cases cited therein.\n It is contended, however, as we have seen, that  29 and 38 of the Judicial Code have instituted a new and more expeditious practice. This is deduced from that part of  29 which provides that the party desiring to remove a case shall make and file with his petition a bond for entering in the district court, within thirty days from the date of filing his petition, a certified copy of the record, written notice thereof to be given the adverse party, and the copy of the record being so entered, 'the parties so removing the said cause shall, within thirty days thereafter, plead, answer, or demur to the declaration or complaint in said cause. . . . '\n The purpose of these provisions, which are an amendment to the prior law, it is contended, is to expedite trials and preclude a defendant from preventing a speedy trial in the state court by removal proceedings and 'then consume the time and expense and exercise of jurisdiction of the Federal court by invoking, by motion, the court's jurisdiction to dismiss the cause, and thus compel plaintiff to go upon a fool's errand.' To prevent this consequence, it is further insisted, the record was required to be filed within thirty days from the date of filing the petition for removal, which, necessarily, it is said, would be in vacation, and that therefore the requirement that within thirty days after it is filed the defendant 'shall plead, answer, or demur to the declaration or complaint in said cause' necessarily means 'a plea or demurrer to the declaration, and cannot mean a plea in abatement to the service of the writ.'\n It may be conceded that the purpose of the amendment was to secure expedition in the disposition of the \n\n[232 U.S. 124, 133]\n\u00a0\n case, but a revolution in the practice and efficacy of the right of removal is not lightly to be inferred. And a revolution it would be. It would take from the Federal courts the power they have possessed under the cases cited,-a power not only to pass upon the merits of the case, but upon the validity of the service of process; that is, upon the question of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant. How essential this power is to the right of removal is obvious. Without it a state could prescribe any process or notice, or a plaintiff, as in the pending case, serve process on a person having no relation with a defendant, and compel him to submit to it and to a jurisdiction not of his residence, or give up his right to take the case to what, in contemplation of law, may be a more impartial tribunal for the determination of the action instituted against him, and which it is the purpose of the removal proceedings to secure to him; and, it must be assumed, completely, not by surrender of any of his rights, but in protection and security of all of them.\n The weakness of plaintiff's contention is demonstrated not only when we consider all of the language of  29, but the language of  38, which provides that in all suits removed the district court shall proceed therein as if the suit had been originally commenced in the district court, 'and the same proceedings had been taken in such suit in said district court as shall have been had therein in said state court prior to its removal.' In other words, the cause is transferred to the district court as it stands in the state court and the defendant is enabled to avail himself in the latter court of any defenses, and, within the time designated, plead to the action 'in the same manner as if it had been originally commenced in said district court.' And these words, we have seen, were explicitly given such effect in the cited cases.\n It is clear, therefore, that plaintiff gives too restrictive a meaning to the word 'plead' in  29. It must be con- \n\n[232 U.S. 124, 134]\n\u00a0\n strued to include a plea to the jurisdiction, and, so construing it, all of the provisions for removal of causes become accordant and their purposes fulfilled,-the right of a speedy disposition of the suit to the plaintiff, and the right of the defendant to have all questions determined by the Federal tribunal.\n Plaintiff further contends that, under the Mississippi Code, the filing of the petition for removal constitutes a general entry of appearance; that therefore, if  29 does not compel the removing party to plead to the declaration within thirty days, 'then, under  914, U. S. Rev. Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 684, the 'practice, pleadings, forms, and modes of proceeding' in the state court, adopted in the Federal Court, would make the plea to the jurisdiction here in the district court a general entry of appearance, and would require a plea to the merits at the next term of the district court under the Code of the state,' because 'a special is a general entry of appearance under  3946, Code of 1906.'\n The contention is untenable.

CALAF Y RIVERA(1914)\nNo. 199\nArgued: January 26, 1914Decided: February 24, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. Manuel Rodriguez-Serra and Charles Hartzell for appellants. \n\n[232 U.S. 371, 372]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Paul Fuller and Frederic R. Coudert for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit brought by the appellants against the testamentary heir of Salvator Calaf, seeking to have the institution of the defendant as heir declared void and the intestate testate succession of Salvator Calaf opened. The appellants alleged that four of them were natural children and the fifth the natural grandson of Ramon Calaf, and that they were his ab-intestate heirs; that Ramon was born on August 31, 1840, and died on October 9, 1895, his parents being Salvador Calaf and Maria Antonia Martinez, who, in short, had legal capacity to marry, and that Salvador recognized Ramon as his natural son; that Salvador died on February 11, 1903, leaving a will by which the defendant, a natural son, was instituted universal heir and the plaintiffs were ignored. The answer denied most of the allegations of the complaint, and alleged that Maria Martinez was a negro slave; that the plaintiff had brought a previous suit against the defendant, claiming one half of the said Salvador's estate as his successor, which was dismissed on demurrer without leave to amend; and that the cause of action was prescribed by articles 199 and 1840 of the Civil Code in force, and 1964, 1939, and 137 of the original Civil Code. The supreme court of Porto Rico held that in a suit to nullify the institution of an heir the recognition of Ramon could be proved only by a judgment or an act in solemn and authentic form, and that there was no such proof; and also that the matter was res judicata and barred. On these grounds it ordered the complaint to be dismissed.\n The former ground was established by this court in Cordova v. Folgueras y Rijos, \n227 U.S. 374\n, 57 L. ed. 556, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 350, in which it was decided that 'while, under the laws of Toro, the acts of \n\n[232 U.S. 371, 373]\n\u00a0\n recognition alleged, although not amounting to a solemn recognition, may have entitled a natural child to sue for her share of the inheritance, and to prove the acts in the same suit, the Code requires a preliminary proceeding to prove those acts and to declare their effect, and limits the time within which such proceeding can be brought.' It was added: 'This hardly can be called an interference with vested rights, when a reasonable time for bringing the preliminary proceeding is allowed.' The change was not a denial of any rights previously acquired, but only a change in the procedure by which such alleged rights were to be proved (as, if disputed, they had to be proved in some proceeding in order to be enjoyed), with a limitation of the time for doing it. We hardly understand it to be asserted that there was any solemn act or authentic instrument satisfying the requirements of the Code for the purposes of the present suit. At all events, we see no reason for doubting the decision of the court below on this point. This being so, the appellant could not prove in this action by private acts of Salvador that Ramon was his natural son, and the supreme court seems to be plainly right in its intimation that the time for a proceeding in which the filiation might be established by such acts has gone by. See Burnet v. Desmornes y Alvarez, \n226 U.S. 145\n, 57 L. ed. 159, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 63.\n Another defense is that the same matter has been adjudged between the parties. The Civil Code in force, article 1219, requires identity 'between the things, causes, and persons of the litigants,' according to the translation in the record. It was said by the court below that there was identity of things, because the end of both suits was to share in the inheritance of Salvador Calaf; that the cause of action was the same; that is, recognition of Ramon as a natural son, asked for in one case and taken for granted in the other; and (with immaterial changes) that the persons were the same. We understand the Codes and the court to assert a doctrine substantially that of our own \n\n[232 U.S. 371, 374]\n\u00a0\n law. The filiation decided against in the former case is a material fact in this one, and is res judicata unless it is avoided by distinctions as to which we will say a word.\n In the former suit the appellants alleged the same descent, but instead of alleging express and solemn recognition of Ramon by Salvador as his natural son, sought to have him declared such, and therefore entitled to inherit one half of Salvador's estate. Its immediate object was to establish filiation by a judgment, while the immediate object here is to nullify a will. The theory put forward was so far different, that unless the complaint in this case had been interpreted as alleging a recognition in solemn form, it would have been held bad on its face. In the former suit also the mother was alleged to have been a slave. But these differing allegations are simply different means to reach the same result,-the possession by Ramon of the rights of a natural son; and the evidence offered in this case like the allegations in the former one was only of private acts. In these circumstances the true principle has been declared by this court to be that a judgment or decree bars all grounds for the relief sought. Northern P. R. Co. v. Slaght, \n205 \nU.S. 122, 130\n, 131 S., 51 L. ed. 738, 741, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 442; United States v. California & O. Land Co. \n192 \nU.S. 355, 358\n, 48 S. L. ed. 476, 478, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 266. The supreme court of Porto Rico has applied the principlehere, and we should require the clearest suthority before we overruled an application that seems to us so obviously correct. It is urged further that there was no final judgment in the former case. Upon a question of that sort we follow the local court unless stronger reasons against it are produced than can be shown here.

Gans for petitioner.\n\n\n[231 U.S. 710, 712]\n\u00a0\n Massistant Attorney General Denison and Mr. Francis H. McAdoo for respondent.\n\n\n[231 U.S. 710, 714]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a writ of certiorari to the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit. The case concerns a prose- \n\n[231 U.S. 710, 715]\n\u00a0\n cution commenced in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York by the finding of two indictments against the petitioner herein, charging perjury in a bankruptcy proceeding. Upon trial the defendant, Cameron, was convicted and sentenced, and upon writ of error the judgment of the circuit court was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals, 113 C. C. A. 20, 192 Fed. 548.\n The first indictment, after setting forth the proceedings in bankruptcy against the Knickerbocker Piano Company, of which the defendant was president and treasurer, alleged that he, upon inquiry, under oath before a special examiner and commissioner, appointed under  21a of the bankruptcy act, prior to adjudication, testified:\n'First. That he, the said Albert B. Cameron, the aforesaid witness, shortly prior to the filing of the aforesaid petition in bankruptcy against the said Knickerbocker Piano Company, had sold a number of pianos to William C. Smith, the petitioner in bankruptcy aforesaid.\n\n'Second. That he, the said Albert B. Cameron, the witness aforesaid, had a conversation with the said William C. Smith, concerning the sale to him of pianos by him, the said Albert B. Cameron.\n\n'Third. That he, the said Albert B. Cameron, the aforesaid witness, had sold to the said William C. Smith, eight pianos for the sum of $668.' And it alleged that the defendant thereby committed perjury.\n\n By the second indictment the defendant is said to have committed perjury in a proceeding before the referee in testifying:\n'First. That he, the said Albert B. Cameron, had not been able to obtain the address of the said William C. Smith, and had never known the said address.\n\n'Second. That he, the said Albert B. Cameron, had \n\n[231 U.S. 710, 716]\n\u00a0\n had a conversation or conversations with the said William C. Smith in regard to his, the said William C. Smith's, buying pianos of and from the said alleged bankrupt.'\n\n The two indictments were consolidated, and, the defendant pleading not guilty, trial was had, and a verdict of guilty returned upon which judgment was rendered.\n The petitioner contends that the bankruptcy act does not authorize the proceeding before the commissioner prior to the adjudication. The record discloses that a receiver had been duly appointed of the assets and effects of the bankrupt, and that he had applied to the court under  21a of the bankruptcy act of 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 552, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3430] for an order requiring the bankrupt, its officers and directors, to appear before a special examiner and commissioner, to be examined concerning the property of the bankrupt and the acts and conduct of its officials. The court made the order requested, and appointed the special examiner and commissioner, before whom Cameron appeared and testified, giving, in the course of his examination, the testimony charged in the first indictment to be false. This proceeding was prior to the adjudication in bankruptcy, which followed a few days later. Whether the examination of Cameron upon oath at that stage of the proceedings was authorized by the bankruptcy act depends upon a construction of clause a,  21, of the act, which provides, in part, as follows:\n'A court of bankruptcy may, upon application of any officer, bankrupt, or creditor, by order require any designated person, including the bankrupt and his wife, to appear in court or before a referee or the judge of any state court, to be examined concerning the acts, conduct, or property of a bankrupt whose estate is in process of administration under this act.' [As amended, 32 Stat. at L. 798, chap. 487,  7, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1498.]\n\n The controversy is over the meaning of the phrase, 'a bankrupt whose estate is in process of administration under this act.' The construction of this provision dif- \n\n[231 U.S. 710, 717]\n\u00a0\n fers in the Federal courts, some of them having held that there can be no such examination until after adjudication, as it is only then that the bankrupt can be subjected to such proceeding. Of this class are Skubinsky v. Bodek, 24 L.R.A.(N.S.) 985, 97 C. C. A. 116, 172 Fed. 332, 19 Ann. Cas. 1035; Podolin v. McGettigan, 113 C. C. A. 668, 193 Fed. 1021; Re Thompson, 179 Fed. 874; Re Davidson, 158 Fed. 678; Re Crenshaw, 155 Fed. 271. To the opposite view are Re Fixen & Co. 96 Fed. 748; Re Fleischer, 151 Fed. 81; Ex parte Bick, 155 Fed. 908; Wechsler v. United States, 86 C. C. A. 37, 158 Fed. 579; United States v. Liberman, 176 Fed. 161. We are of opinion that the estate was in process of administration at the time when the examination before the commissioner was ordered, and the testimony of Cameron given. This court has decided that the filing of the petition in bankruptcy operates to place the property of the alleged bankrupt in custodia legis, and prevents any creditor from attaching it; and, although, by the terms of the act, the estate does not vest in the trustee until the date of the adjudication, it is placed at the time of the filing of the petition under the control of the court with a view to its ultimate distribution among creditors. Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman Lumber Co. \n222 U.S. 300\n, 307 56 L. ed. 208, 213, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 96; and see Mueller v. Nugent, \n184 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 46 S. L. ed. 405, 411, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269; Everett v. Judson, \n228 \nU.S. 474, 478\n, 479 S., 57 L. ed. 927, 929, 46 L.R.A.(N.S.) 154, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 568. And this is true, notwithstanding, as contended by the petitioner, that should the attempt to obtain an adjudication of bankruptcy fail upon the subsequent hearings, the receivership would necessarily be vacated and the property turned back to the alleged bankrupt.\n In order to arrive at the true meaning of  21a other provisions as well as the purpose of the act must be had in view. The object of the examination of the bankrupt and other witnesses to show the condition of the estate is to enable the court to discover its extent and whereabouts, and to come into possession of it, that the rights of creditors may be preserved. If such examination is postponed \n\n[231 U.S. 710, 718]\n\u00a0\n until after adjudication, which may not take place for at least twenty days, within which the bankrupt in involuntary bankruptcy is given leave to appear and plead, the estate may be concealed and disposed of, and the purpose of the act to hold it and to distribute it for the benefit of creditors defeated. The importance of such early examination of bankrupts was emphasized in Re Fleischer, 151 Fed. 81. By subdivision 9 of  7 of the act, it is provided that the bankrupt shall, 'when present at the first meeting of his creditors, and at such other times as the court shall order, submit to an examination concerning the conducting of his business, the cause of his bankruptcy, his dealings with his creditors and other persons, the amount, kind, and whereabouts of his property, and, in addition, all matters which may affect the administration and settlement of his estate.' Here is found authority to examine the bankrupt at such other times than the first meeting of creditors as the court may direct. This section should be read with  21a, and throws light upon its proper construction. In this case the petitioner had invoked the jurisdiction of the court, a receiver had been appointed to take possession of the property, the court was so far in possession of it as to prevent other courts from seizing it, and thus defeating the bankruptcy jurisdiction. We are of opinion that the estate was then in process of administration, and the examination ordered was within the jurisdiction of the court.\n Other questions in the case relate to alleged violations of immunity afforded the defendant under statutes of the United States, which were invoked by him at the trial in the circuit court. Records were there offered in evidence showing the testimony given by Cameron before the examiner and before the referee. Cameron claimed that this testimony was incompetent for the purpose of establishing his guilt beyond showing that it was in fact given. \n\n[231 U.S. 710, 719]\n\u00a0\n Counsel for petitioner relies upon the immunity clause of  7 of the bankruptcy act, and upon  860 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 661) in force at the time the testimony was given, but repealed by the act of May 7, 1910 (36 Stat. at L. 352, chap. 216, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 272). Section 7, subdivision 9, of the bankruptcy act, cited above, concludes: 'But no testimony given by him shall be offered in evidence against him in any criminal proceeding.' This section was before this court, so far as the immunity provided is concerned, in Glickstein v. United States, \n222 U.S. 139\n, 56 L. ed. 128, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 71, where it was held not to prevent a prosecution for perjury in the giving of testimony by a bankrupt, and the immunity was held to apply to past transactions concerning which the bankrupt might be examined. In the opinion in that case, Edelstein v. United States (circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit) 9 L.R.A.(N.S.) 236, 79 C. C. A. 328, 149 Fed. 636, which had held that the words 'any criminal proceeding' in which immunity is provided are limited to such criminal proceedings as arise out of the conduct of the bankrupt's business or the disposition of his property, etc ., concerning which he may be examined, was cited with approval. In Ensign v. Pennsylvania, \n227 \nU.S. 592, 600\n, 57 S. L. ed. 658, 662, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 321, it was held that full effect could be given to the immunity provision by confining it to the testimony given under subdivision 9, to which it was immediately subjoined. As the present prosecutions was based upon alleged false swearing in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings,  7 of the bankruptcy act can have no application.\n Petitioner also invokes the protection of  860 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 661), which reads:\n'No pleading of a party, nor any discovery or evidence obtained from a party or witness by means of a judicial proceeding in this or any foreign country, shall be given in evidence, or in any manner used against him of his property or estate, in any court of the United States, in any criminal proceeding, or for the enforcement of any \n\n[231 U.S. 710, 720]\n\u00a0\n penalty or forfeiture: Provided, that this section shall not exempt any party or witness from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in discovering or testifying as aforesaid.'\n\n The government contends that the subsequent repeal of this section deprives the petitioner of the immunity afforded. We cannot agree with this contention. It would be subversive of principles of right and justice to give such effect to a statute upon the protection of which the petitioner had the right to rely at the time when called upon to testify in the bankruptcy court, and in consequence of which he may be presumed to have given his testimony. A retrospective operation of statutes is not to be given except in clear cases, unequivocally evidencing the legislative intent to that effect. Union P. R. Co. v. Laramie Stock Yards Co., \n231 \nU.S. 190, 199\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 101, and previous cases in this court, cited in the opinion in that case. Summers v. United States, \n231 U.S. 92\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 38. In the absence of a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary, the court will presume that the law-making power is acting for the future, and does not intend to impair obligations incurred or rights relied upon in the past conduct of men when other legislation was in force. White v. United States, \n191 \nU.S. 545, 552\n, 48 S. L. ed. 295, 298, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 171.\n The circuit court of appeals in the instant case was of opinion that the petitioner was entitled to the immunity afforded in  860 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 661), but failed to find in the record any instance of its violation. Section 860 by its express terms does not exempt a party from prosecution for perjury committed in testifying in the instances named. It was held in Glickstein v. United States, supra, of  7 of the bankruptcy act, that this immunity was not intended to put a premium upon perjury by giving protection against the use of the testimony in prosecutions for that crime; and we cannot agree with petitioner's contention that the use of such testimony is limited to proving that \n\n[231 U.S. 710, 721]\n\u00a0\n it was in fact given. In prosecutions for perjury the statute saved the right to use such testimony for any legitimate purpose in establishing the charge made. While this is true, the statute by its terms protects the party from the use of such testimony in any court of the United States in any criminal proceeding.\n The subsequent prosecution of Cameron for perjury in the two bankruptcy proceedings was a criminal proceeding in a court of the United States, and the testimony given in the one bankruptcy proceeding, not tending to establish perjury in that proceeding, should not have been received to establish the crime charged in the other proceeding. In this case it will be noted from the statement already made, that the indictment based upon the testimony before the referee charged that Cameron falsely swore that he had not been able to obtain and had never known the address of William C. Smith, the man with whom it was charged the fraudlent transactions regarding the pianos were had. In the first indictment based upon the testimony before the commissioner, there is no such charge. The government having put in evidence the proceedings before the referee showing that Cameron there testified that he did not know Smith's address, and that he was not acquainted with his friends, and that he did not know anyone who knew him, the record of Cameron's testimony before the commissioner was offered in evidence, and, over specific objections calling attention to the lack of such charge in the first indictment based on the proceedings before the commissioner, the government was permitted to read:\n'Q. Did you, shortly prior to the filing of the petition, sell some pianos and realize cash on them?\n\n'A. Yes, I did.\n\n'Q. To whom were they sold?\n\n'A. They were sold to W. C. Smith.\n\n'Q. Where is his place of business? \n\n[231 U.S. 710, 722]\n\u00a0\n 'A. He is not in business. 'Q. Who is he? 'A. Why, an acquaintance of mine. 'Q. Where does he live? 'A. On St. Nicholas avenue, I don't recall the address. 'Q. What number? 'A. I don't remember. 'Q. Between what streets? 'A. Above 125th. 'Q. Is it an apartment or a private house? 'A. Why, I think just a furnished room, or rooms.' Mr. McManus: I object to this as immaterial and not within the issues. There is no allegation in the indictment, or the assignment of perjury, as to the alleged address of William C. Smith, and in the proceedings before the commissioner-- Mr. Smith: I am reading so the jury will get some sort of a comprehensive idea as to what the man testified to. This is the beginning of this alleged transaction with William C. Smith. The Court: Cut it down closer. Mr. Smith: I have cut it down to about two pages. Objection overruled. Exception by defendant. Mr. Smith (reading): 'Q. How long have you known him? 'A. Oh, three or four years. 'Q. Do you know whether he is employed by anybody? 'A. Yes, sir, but I don't know where. 'Q. You haven't any idea in what capacity he is employed? 'A. No. 'Q. How often do you meet him? 'A. Not very often. 'Q. How often did you meet him before this last transaction? 'A. Oh, two or three times. \n\n[231 U.S. 710, 723]\n\u00a0\n 'Q. How long do you know him? 'A. Three or four years, I think. Mr. McManus: This is another line, subject to the last exception. 'Q. Where did you first meet him? 'A. New York. 'Q. Where? 'A. I don't recall that. 'Q. Do you know anybody else other than yourself who knows Mr. Smith? 'A. He has a number of friends. 'Q. Do you know of anybody? 'A. My brothers. 'Q. Outside of your family? 'A. No. 'Q. Is he related to you? 'A. No. 'Q. Is he related to any member of your family? 'A. No. 'Q. Do you know how he can be located? 'A. Why, yes, I could get hold of him. 'Q. How could you get hold of him today? 'A. I'd go and ask my brother. 'Q. You think he could give you the address? 'A. Yes, sir, I think so. 'Q. Did you send to Mr. Smith to come to the place and buy some pianos? 'A. I had to sell some pianos to get some money. 'Q. Where did you send to get him? 'A. I got him through my brother.'\n\n The effect of this testimony was to distinctly contradict the testimony which Cameron had given before the referee, and which was the subject-matter of the indictment based on the proceedings before that officer. It did not tend to establish the charge growing out of his testimony before \n\n[231 U.S. 710, 724]\n\u00a0\n the commissioner, which related solely to the sale of pianos and conversations between Cameron and Smith concerning the sales. The district attorney contended that this testimony was competent in order that the jury might get some sort of comprehensive idea as to what the man testified to, and, in view of that statement and the expressed view of the court that anything that threw light on the event was admissible, the testimony was admitted. It is contended that it was competent as showing the relations of Cameron the Smith and to identify Smith, but there was no question in the case as to who Smith was. He was a witness called to establish the charge of perjury, and he was the person with whom it was charged the fraudulent dealings in pianos were had by the bankrupt. The testimony offered as to what Cameron swore to before the examiner, while not tending to establish the charge of perjury based upon testimony in that instance, did contradict the testimony which he had given before the referee, and directly tended to establish the charge under that indictment. We think to permit the use of the testimony for that purpose was to permit the testimony given in the one instance to be used in a criminal proceeding based upon testimony given in the other instance, and therefore to violate the immunity given in  860 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 661), then in force.\n Other errors are alleged, and it is contended that there was no adequate proof of the charges made, but these questions were submitted to the jury and cannot be re-examined here. We are of the opinion that error was committed in the use given to the testimony taken before the commissioner in the manner we have stated, and for that reason the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming the conviction of Cameron in the court below, should be reversed.\n Reversed and remanded to the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCARLESI v.

Vandiver, George Gordon Battle, John Caldwell Myers, James E. Brande, Joseph Weber, and J. Joseph Lilly for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 51, 55]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert S. Johnstone, Stanley L. Richter, and Charles S. Whitman for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error was accused of the crime 'of forgery in the second degree as a second offense.' The indictment contained a recital of the prior offense relied on, that is, a conviction in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York, and a sentence for three and one-half years in the penitentiary for the crime of selling and having in possession counterfeit coin. The statute of the state of New York, which was the authority for referring to the prior conviction, was as follows:\n'A person who, after having been convicted within this state, of a felony, or an attempt to commit a felony, or of petit larceny, or, under the laws of any other state, government, or country, of a crime which, if committed within this state, would be a felony, commits any crime, within this state, is punishable, upon conviction of such second offense, as follows:\n\n'1. If the subsequent crime is such that, upon a first conviction, the offender might be punished, in the discretion of the court, by imprisonment for life, he must be sentenced to imprisonment in a state prison for life. \n\n[233 U.S. 51, 56]\n\u00a0\n\n'2. If the subsequent crime is such that, upon the first conviction, the offender would be punishable by imprisonment for any term less than his natural life, then such person must be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not less than the longest term, nor more than twice the longest term, prescribed upon the first conviction.' [Penal Laws (Consol. Laws, chap. 40 )  1941.]\n\n\n The accused pleaded not guilty, and while admitting the truth of the recitals in the indictment as to his prior conviction, sentence, and service of time in the penitentiary, moved to strike from the indictment all reference to those subjects, and insisted on his right to be tried without at all considering or in any manner referring to the prior conviction and sentence on the ground of a pardon granted to him by the President of the United States after he had completed his term of service under the prior conviction. The pardon relied upon was offered in evidence. On the trial which followed the refusal of the court to grant the motion to strike out or to rule as requested, the alleged Federal right based upon the pardon was further urged upon the court in every conceivable form, and was adversely acted upon, and after conviction was also pressed and adversely passed upon in both the appellate division (154 App. Div. 481, 139 N. Y. Supp. 309) and in the court of appeals of New York (208 N. Y. 547, 101 N. E. 1114). And it is the adverse ruling of the court of appeals concerning such asserted Federal right which forms the sole basis for this writ of error, addressed to the trial court because of the action of the court of appeals in remitting the entire record to that court.\n The arguments at bar cover a wider field than is essential to be considered in order to pass upon the question for decision. As the state courts held that the statute directed the consideration of the prior conviction despite the pardon, we must treat the case as if the statute so expressly commanded, and test its repugnancy to the Constitution \n\n[233 U.S. 51, 57]\n\u00a0\n of the United States upon that assumption. The issue is a narrow one, and involves not the determination of the operation and effect of a pardon within the jurisdiction of the sovereignty granting it, but simply requires it to be decided how far a pardon granted as to an offense committed against the United States operates, so to speak, extraterritorially as a limitation upon the states, excluding them from considering the conviction of the prior and pardoned offense against the United States in a prosecution for a subsequent state offense. It may not be questioned that the states are without right directly or indirectly to restrict the national government in the exertion of its legitimate powers. It is therefore to be conceded that if the act of the state in taking into consideration a prior conviction of an offense committed by the same offender against the laws of the United States despite a pardon was in any just sense a punishment for such prior crime, that the act of the state would be void because destroying or circumscribing the effect of the pardon granted under the Constitution and laws of the United States. And of course, conversely, it must be conceded that if it be that the act of the state in taking into consideration a prior offense committed against the United States after pardon under the circumstances stated was not in any degree a punishment for the prior crime, but was simply an exercise by the state of a local power within its exclusive cognizance, there could be no violation of the Constitution of the United States. The whole controversy therefore is to be resolved by fixing the nature and character of the action of the state under the circumstances for the purpose of deciding under which of these two categories it is to be classed. When the issue is thus defined and limited its solution is free from difficulty, as it has been repeatedly and conclusively foreclosed by the prior adjudications of this court.\n In McDonald v. Massachusetts, \n180 U.S. 311\n, 45 L. ed. 542, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 389, the court \n\n[233 U.S. 51, 58]\n\u00a0\n considered and adversely disposed of a contention that a statute of the state of Massachusetts was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States because it provided for a punishment as an habitual criminal of any person convicted of a felony in Massachusetts who was found to have been 'twice convicted of crime, sentenced and committed to prison, in this or any other state, or once in this and once at least in any other state, . . . ' In holding that the statute was not in conflict with the Constitution, the court said:\n'The fundamental mistake of the plaintiff in error is his assumption that the judgment below imposes an additional punishment on crimes for which he had already been convicted and punished in Massachusetts and in New Hampshire.\n\n'But it does no such thing. The statute under which it was rendered is aimed at habitual criminals; and simply imposes a heavy penalty upon conviction of a felony committed in Massachusetts since its passage, by one who had been twice convicted and imprisoned for crime for not less than three years, in this or in another state, or once in each. The punishment is for the new crime only, but is the heavier if he is an habitual criminal. . . . It is within the discretion of the legislature of the state to treat former imprisonment in another state as having the like effect as imprisonment in Massachusetts, to show that the man is an habitual criminal. . . . The statute, imposing a punishment on none but future crimes, is not ex post facto. It affects alike all persons similarly situated, and therefore does not deprive anyone of the equal protection of the laws. Moore v. Missouri, \n159 U.S. 673\n, 40 L. ed. 301, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 179; Ross's Case, 2 Pick. 165; Com. v. Graves, 155 Mass. 163, 16 L.R.A. 256, 29 N. E. 579; Sturtevant v. Com. 158 Mass. 598, 33 N. E. 648; Com. v. Richardson, 175 Mass. 202, 55 N. E. 988.\n\n'The statute does not impair the right of trial by jury \n\n[233 U.S. 51, 59]\n\u00a0\n or put the accused twice in jeopardy for the same offense, or impose a cruel or unusual punishment.' (pp. 312, 313.) The subject again came under consideration in Graham v. West Virginia, \n224 U.S. 616\n, 56 L. ed. 917, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 583, and was re-examined in all its aspects, and after a full reference to the English and American authorities, the doctrine announced in the McDonald Case was re-expounded and reapplied so as to now leave no room for any further controversy whatsoever on the subject. Applying the principles thus settled, the case before us clearly comes within the second category which we have stated, and therefore the contention as to the effect of the pardon here pressed is devoid of all merit, and the court below was right in so holding.\n\n Determining as we do only the case before us, that is, whether the granting of a pardon by the President for a crime committed against the United States operates to restrict and limit the power of the state of New York to punish crimes thereafter committed against its authority, and in so doing to prescribe such penalties as may be deemed appropriate in view of the nature of the offense and the character of the offender, taking in view his past conduct, we must not be understood as in the slightest degree intimating that a pardon would operate to limit the power of the United States in punishing crimes against its authority to provide for taking into consideration past offenses committed by the accused as a circumstance of aggravation, even although for such past offenses there had been a pardon granted.\n Indeed, we must not be understood as intimating that it would be beyond the legislative competency to provide that the fact of the commission of an offense after a pardon of a prior offense should be considered as adding an increased element of aggravation to that which would otherwise result alone from the commission of the prior offense.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","29":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCARLSON v. STATE OF WASHINGTON(1914)\nNo. 307\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 103, 104]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Corwin S. Shank for plaintiff in error.\n No counser appeared for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n Plaintiff in error was adjudged by the superior court of Thurston county, in the state of Washington, to be in contempt of that court, in that, with notice of a decree made by it, restraining and enjoining any further excavation of the Lake Washington canal, or any lowering of the waters of Lake Washington, he proceeded to blow out an embankment at the head of the canal, which, until that \n\n[234 U.S. 103, 105]\n\u00a0\n time, held the waters of the lake at their natural level, so as to permit these waters to flow into the canal and thereby lower the level of the lake. The supreme court of the state affirmed the judgment (66 Wash. 639, 120 Pac. 104), and the case comes here under  237, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 227], upon the ground that the acts done by plaintiff in error, and because of which he was held to be in contempt of court, were done under the direction and authorization of officers of the War Department of the United States, acting in the performance of their duties in constructing a public improvement consisting of a ship canal extending from Lake Washington to Salmon bay, in pursuance of statutes of the United States.\n Our examination of the Federal question is somewhat embarrassed because the findings and statements of fact by the state courts contain no finding respecting some of the facts that are alleged as the basis of the present contention of plaintiff in error. The inadequacy is attributable, no doubt, to the mode in which the alleged Federal right was asserted. Plaintiff in error having been brought before the trial court upon an order to show cause, based upon a sworn complaint or information made by the relator, setting forth circumstantially the blowing out of the embankment in question by one Erickson and by plaintiff in error as his foreman, the latter in his answer denied that he blew out the embankment upon the orders of Erickson, and on the contrary averred that he 'did so by express orders of the engineering department of the United States government,' There was testimony tending to support this averment, but the trial court, while making no specific finding upon the subject, in effect held that the work was done in behalf of the state of Washington, one of the parties to the cause in which the restraining decree was made. To its findings numerous exceptions were taken, but in none of these was any Federal right asserted, nor was any deficiency in the findings suggested. The su- \n\n[234 U.S. 103, 106]\n\u00a0\n preme court, however, instead of disregarding the claim of Federal right upon the ground that it had been abandoned in the trial court, recognized the contention of plaintiff in error that the 'work was done under the direction of the United States engineers who had charge of the work for the government,' and by its decision necessarily overruled it. We must therefore deal with the Federal question. North Carolina R. Co. v. Zachary, \n232 \nU.S. 248, 257\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 305.\n Among the assignments of error is one based upon the refusal of the supreme court to find as a fact that the acts for the performance of which plaintiff in error was held guilty of contempt were done under the direction and authorization of officials of the War Department of the United States, acting in pursuance of and in accordance with the acts of Congress. While, in ordinary cases, we are bound by the findings of the state court of last resort respecting matters of fact, it is hardly necessary to say that that court cannot, by omitting to pass upon the basic questions of fact, deprive a litigant of the benefit of a Federal right, any more than it could do so by making findings that were wholly without support in the evidence. And just as this court, where its appellate jurisdiction is properly invoked and all the evidence is brought before it, will, if necessary for a decision of a Federal question, examine the entire record in order to determine whether there is evidence to support the findings of the state court, so it is our duty, in the absence of adequate findings, to examine the evidence in order to determine what facts might reasonably be found therefrom, and which would furnish a basis for the asserted Federal right. Southern P. Co. v. Schuyler, \n227 \nU.S. 601, 611\n, 57 S. L. ed. 662, 669, 43 L.R.A.(N.S.) 901, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 277, and cases cited.\n Since the present record appears to contain all the evidence that was submitted to the state courts, we proceed to supplement the statement made by the supreme court by adding such further facts pertaining to the asserted \n\n[234 U.S. 103, 107]\n\u00a0\n claim of Federal right as might reasonably have been found, with the following result:\n One Erickson, a general contractor, had entered into a contract for excavating a part of the Lake Washington canal. The contract was in writing, dated August 16, 1910, and was made between 'Arthur Williams, Captain Corps Engineers, United States Army, hereinafter represented as the contracting officer representing the state of Washington, on the one part, and C. J. Erickson, of Seattle, in the county of King, state of Washington, hereinafter designated as the contractor, of the second part.' The work covered by the contract was nearing completion when, on October 22, 1910, in an action pending in the superior court in and for the county of Thurston, between William L. Bilger and others, plaintiffs, and the state of Washington, King county, and Erickson, defendants, upon the application of the plaintiffs for an order enjoining defendants from removing the embankment between the excavated portion of the canal and Lake Washington, the court, being satisfied that such removal might tend to lower the waters of the lake to the detriment and damage of the plaintiffs, announced that a restraining order would issue. In accordance with this announcement a formal decree was made under date October 28. Erickson had notice of the announced decree, and plaintiff in error, who was acting as his foreman upon the work, had written notice of it on October 26, after which he proceeded to blow up the embankment, contrary to the prohibition. Under the state practice, the decree bound them from the time they were informed of it, although it was not yet formally entered. There was evidence tending to show that plaintiff in error acted under orders coming not from Erickson, but from Captain Williams; and his own testimony was to this effect. Other evidence tended to show that the canal strip or right of way was in the control of the War Department, with a watchman actually upon \n\n[234 U.S. 103, 108]\n\u00a0\n the ground. The contract was not introduced in evidence, and there was only meager testimony as to its contents, which left it doubtful whether the final work of excavating the opening between the head of the canal and the lake was within its provisions. Since there is no distinct finding upon this subject, we will consider the case in both aspects.\n The act of Congress especially invoked as authority for what was done by plaintiff in error under direction of Captain Williams is the river and harbor act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. at L. 630, 666, chap. 382), which contains the following:\n'Puget sound-Lake Washington waterway: Continuing improvement by the construction of a double lock, with the necessary accessory works, to be located at 'the Narrows,' at the entrance to Salmon bay, in accordance with the project set forth in House Document numbered nine hundred and fifty-three, Sixtieth Congress, first session, one hundred and fifty thousand dollars; and the Secretary of War may enter into a contract or contracts for such material and work as may be necesary to complete said lock and accessory works, to be paid for as funds may be provided from time to time by law, not to exceed in the aggregate two million, two hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars, including the amount herein appropriated; Provided, that before beginning said work, or making such contract or contracts, the Secretary of War shall be satisfied that King county, or some other local agency, will do the excavation in the waterway above the lock to the dimensions recommended in said project, and will also secure the United States from liability for any claims or damages on account of the grant made to James A. Moore or his assigns by the act of Congress approved June eleventh, nineteen hundred and six [34 Stat. at L. 231, chap. 3072, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1535], or on account of the lowering of the level of Lake Washington, raising the level of Salmon bay, or any other alteration of the level of any part of said waterway.' \n\n[234 U.S. 103, 109]\n\u00a0\n In order to correctly appreciate the meaning and effect of this language, it is necessary to refer to House Document No. 953, 60th Cong., 1st Sess. (vol. 20), and to certain previous acts of Congress therein mentioned; and while reviewing these acts we may at the same time consider whether any of them contains any justification of what was done by plaintiff in error.\n\n By way of preface, it should be stated that the city of Seattle lies between the tidal waters of Puget sound and Lake Washington, the latter being a body of fresh water 2 miles or more in width and 19 miles or more in length, and having a natural level 30 feet or more above mean low water in the sound. Between this lake and the sound is Lake Union, a smaller body of fresh water (covering about 1,000 acres), and having a natural level much lower than that of Lake Washington, yet considerably above the tide. The lakes had independent natural outlets. Salmon bay is a small body of water connected through Shilshole bay with Puget sound, and is (or was) affected by the ebb and flow of the tide. The outlet of Salmon bay is known as 'the Narrows.' Salmon bay and Lake Union are wholly within the exterior limits of Seattle, and the city has also a considerable frontage on Lake Washington. This lake, as well as the city, lies within the limits of King county.\n As early as the year 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 452, chap. 907, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3527), Congress authorized a survey and estimate to be made for a ship canal to connect the waters of these lakes with Puget sound. A survey and report were made accordingly, but nothing resulted until 1894 ( 28 Stat. at L. 360, chap. 299), when Congress appropriated $25,000 for dredging Salmon bay, and the improvement of the waterway connecting its waters with the lakes, but with a proviso that no part of the money should be expended upon the improvement of the connecting waterway until the entire right of way and a release \n\n[234 U.S. 103, 110]\n\u00a0\n from all liability to adjacent property owners had been secured to the United States free of cost and to the satisfaction of the Secretary of War. By act of March 2, 1895 (28 Stat. at L. 948, chap. 189), $5,000 of this amount was authorized to be expended in making a definite survey and location of the improvement and in preparing a cadastral map showing each property required to be deeded to the United States, or from which a release was required. The act of June 3, 1896 (29 Stat. at L. 234, chap. 314, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1540), appropriated $150,000, again with the proviso that no part of it should be expended on the improvement of the waterway connecting the sound with the lakes until the entire right of way and a release from all liability to adjacent property owners had been secured to the United States; and with the further declaration that the canal might be constructed either by the Smith's cove route or by the Shilshole bay route, in the discretion of the Secratary of War.\n In 1898 a Board of Engineer Officers was appointed to determine the choice, and recommended the Shilshole bay route, with a lock at the Narrows, near the foot of Salmon bay. This recommendation was approved by the Secretary of War April 14, 1899, and right of way proceedings were completed and deeds obtained and accepted by the Secretary of War in 1900\n\n\n The legislature of Washington, by act approved February 8, 1901 (Sess. Laws, p. 7), granted to the United States the right to construct and operate the ship canal upon any lands belonging to and waters of the state in King county, within limits to be defined by the plans and specifications for the improvement as approved by the Secretary of War, with the right to raise the waters of Salmon bay and to lower the waters of Lake Washington in the prosecution of the improvement.\n Congress was still unwilling to sanction any particular project for the canal, and by act of June 13, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 347, chap. 1079), while an appropriation of $160,000 was \n\n[234 U.S. 103, 111]\n\u00a0\n made under the usual designation for 'improving waterway connecting Puget sound with Lakes Union and Washington,' it was provided that this sum, together with the unexpended balance to the credit of the improvement, should be expended in dredging a low-water channel 10 feet in depth from Shilshole bay through Salmon bay to the wharves at Ballard (at the head of the bay); with a further proviso that a board of engineers should be appointed by the Secretary of War to make surveys, examinations, and investigations to determine the feasibility and advisability of constructing a canal with necessary locks and dams, connecting Puget sound with the lakes, of sufficient width and depth to accommodate the largest commercial and naval vessels, to examine the route for a similar canal connecting Elliott bay with the lakes, and to report upon the relative advantages of all proposed routes; and it was declared that 'nothing herein shall be construed as the adoption of any project for the construction of a waterway connecting Puget sound with Lakes Union and Washington.' The board reported, January 6, 1903, that a canal sufficient to accommodate the largest commercial and naval vessels was feasible, but not advisable, chiefly because of the great cost, estimated at over $8,000, 000.\n The act of March 3, 1905 (33 Stat. at L. 1144, chap. 1482), made a further appropriation of $125,000, limited to dredging the channel to Ballard.\n Meanwhile, it appears, the people of Seattle had become discouraged about the prospect of obtaining government aid, and therefore accepted the proposition of one James A. Moore to build upon the government right of way a canal with a suitable timber lock, if the county of King would contribute $500,000 toward it; and an act of Congress of June 11, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 231, chap. 3072, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1535), was secured, authorizing him to proceed with this work, subject to such conditions and stipulations as should be imposed by the \n\n[234 U.S. 103, 112]\n\u00a0\n Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of War for the protection of navigation and the property and other interests of the United States, to include provision for the discharge of waters from Lakes Union and Washington, and afford adequate protection against claims for damages for changing the level of Lake Washington, and subject to provisos which required that plans and specifications should be approved by the Secretary of War, that Moore and his assigns should be liable for any damage occasioned by the construction of the lock and canal by overflow, by a lowering of the waters affected, or otherwise, and that the canal and lock when completed should be turned over to the United States ready for use and free of all expense.\n The Moore plan included a timber lock between the lakes, and seems to have contemplated another lock to be constructed by the government at the mouth of Salmon bay. Shortly after the passage of the act just mentioned King county pledged its credit to the extent of $500,000 in aid of the Moore project. A little later however, the local interests inaugurated a movement for the installation of a permanent masonry lock in place of the timber lock, and legislative authorization was procured (act of March 18, 1907, Sess. Laws, p. 582) for the establishment of an assessment district in order to impose upon the shore lands benefited a part of the cost of the improvement. The same legislature supplemented the act of 1901 by a specific grant of a right of way over state lands between the lakes (act of March 16, 1907, Sess. Laws, p. 498).\n About the same time Congress was again appealed to, and by act of March 2, 1907 (34 Stat. at L. 1108, chap. 2509), the Secretary of War was authorized to 'make a survey and estimate of cost of said waterway or canal with one lock, with a view to the construction of the same, in conjunction with the county authorities of King county or other agency, of sufficient size to accommodate the largest commercial or naval vessels afloat; or, if deemed more \n\n[234 U.S. 103, 113]\n\u00a0\n advisable, with a view to the construction of a canal of less dimensions, and to submit dimensions and estimate of cost of same, together with a report upon what portion of said work will be done or contribution to be made by said county or other agency.' And the provisions of the act of June 11, 1906, were thereby so modified as to permit Moore or his assigns to excavate a channel from deep water in Puget sound at the mouth of Salmon bay to deep water in Lake Washington, in lieu of constructing the canal and timber lock specified in that act. In June, 1907, Moore assigned his rights to a corporation created for the purpose of taking them over and co-operating with the assessment district in carrying out the work proposed to be done by local agencies; and it appears that some preliminary work was done upon the ground. By act of Congress of February 6, 1909 (35 Stat. at L. 613, chap. 83), the time allowed to moore or his assigns for completion of the canal was extended until June 11, 1912.\n In view of the history of the matter, the phrase 'waterway or canal with one lock' in the act of 1907 evidently indicated a lock at the Narrows, and a continuous waterway thence to Lake Washington; and so it was canstrued. Pursuant to the authorization of Congress, an elaborate report of a survey and estimate of the cost of the proposed waterway was made by Major Chittenden, of the Engineer Corps, under date December 2, 1907, and submitted with the approval of the Division Engineer to the Chief of Engineers at Washington. It was reviewed by the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors, and approved by them under date March 30, 1908, transmitted by the Chief of Engineers, with his approval, to the Secretary of War, and by the Acting Secretary transmitted to Congress under date May 20, 1908. It is this report and the accompanying documents which constitute House Doc. No. 953, 60th Congress, 1st Sess., vol. 20, referred to in the act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. at L. 666, chap. 382), above quoted. \n\n[234 U.S. 103, 114]\n\u00a0\n The project as thus submitted contemplated the construction of a double lock, to be located at the Narrows at the entrance to Salmon bay, and an unbroken waterway through Salmon bay and Lakes Union and Washington, the differences in level to be overcome by raising Salmon bay and lowering Lake Washington approximately to the level of Lake Union. With reference to that part of the act of 1907 requiring report to be made as to what portion of the work would be done or contribution made by King county or other agency, the recommendation was that, in lieu of a cash contribution, the local interests should be asked to do a specific portion of the work. Major Chittenden proposed that the government should build the lock, and that the local agency should excavate the canal. His recommendation to this effect was concurred in by the Division Engineer and by the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors, and the board further recommended: 'That the undertaking of the project by the United States be made contingent upon the furnishing to the Secretary of War of satisfactory evidence: First. That King county or other local agency will do the excavation in the waterway above the lock to the dimensions recommended. Second. That the said King county or other local agency will hold the United States free from any claims or damages on account of the grant made to James A. Moore or his assigns on account of the act of June 11, 1906. Third. That the said King county or other local agency will hold the United States free against any claims or damages on account of lowering the level of Lake Washington, raising the level of Salmon bay, or any other alteration of the level of any part of said waterway.'\n As will appear by reference to the act of 1910, these recommendations were approved and adopted by Congress as a part of the project, and the appropriation, as well as the authorization of the contract, was confined to the construction of a double lock at the Narrows. From the fore- \n\n[234 U.S. 103, 115]\n\u00a0\n going review, it becomes evident that prior to this act all that was done by authority of Congress on the part of the Federal government (aside from surveys and estimates and the acceptance of a conveyance of lands for the right of way of the canal) consisted of dredging work in Salmon bay; and that the first construction work authorized in aid of the ship canal proper was that provided by the act of 1910, and was limited to the construction by the government of a lock at the Narrows. It is further evident that at all times, and notably in the act of 1910, Congress has scrupulously refrained from authorizing anything to be done on the part of the Federal government with reference to lowering the level of Lake Washington, raising the level of Salmon bay, or otherwise altering the level of any part of the waterway, and that by the act of 1910 it was expressly provided that all responsibility for this should be assumed by King county or some other local agency.\n Now, the Bilger suit, as appears by the decree therein already mentioned, was brought by parties who were owners of shore lands abutting upon Lake Washington, and riparian rights pertaining thereto, and the action was based upon the injury threatened to their property and rights by the material lowering of the water of that lake, which was a necessary part of the public improvement. The defendants were the state, the county, and the contractor, and the object of the decree forbidding the further excavation of the canal was to prevent the lowering of the water to the detriment of plaintiffs' property rights. There is nothing to show that the United States had acquired any rights as against these plaintiffs or other property owners of the same class, and any assumption by the War Department of responsibility for interfering with the natural level of the lake is inconsistent with the whole course of legislation to which reference has been made, and especially with the act of 1910. And this renders more \n\n[234 U.S. 103, 116]\n\u00a0\n clear, what would probably be sufficiently plain from the language above quoted from the instrument, that the contract of August 16, 1910, between Captain Williams and Erickson, was made not in behalf of the United States, but in behalf of the state of Washington. An engineer officer of the United States Army was probably selected to represent the state as a matter of convenience, in view of the fact that before acceptance of the finished work by the government, the approval of the Secretary of War was a necessary prerequisite. But this did not in any wise enlarge the authority of Captain Williams with respect to the performance of the agreement. The act of Congress gave him no authority to act in behalf of the Federal government with respect to the work of excavating the canal, or making a connection between it and Lake Washington which would necessarily lower the level of this lake. Hence it is a matter of no moment, for present purposes, whether the work for which plaintiff in error was held guilty of contempt of court, and which he claims was done under order of Captain Williams, was within or without the Erickson contract.\n We are aware that the supreme court of the state of Washington, upon review of the decree in the Bilger suit, held that while the actual work of dredging the canal was done by the state and the county, it was done on behalf of the United States. It was for this reason, in part, this the decree awarding an injunction to restrain the further excavation of the canal was reversed. 63 Wash. 457, 467, 116 Pac. 19. So far as this view may have influenced the court in declaring the policy of the state, we have no concern with it. But we deem it clear that, under the acts of Congress, no agency for the Federal government could arise with respect to anything done in the construction of the canal or the lowering of the level of Lake Washington. Neither the fact that the title to the right of way was vested in the United States, nor \n\n[234 U.S. 103, 117]\n\u00a0\n the presumed purpose that the Secretary of War should take charge of the work when finished, can override the evident policy of Congress that the canal should be accepted only when completed and ready for use, free of cost to the United States, and that the local interests should do the work of excavation and assume sole responsibility for lowering the level of the water.\n Since we are of the opinion that Captain Williams derived no authority from the acts of Congress, it follows that the immunity here asserted with respect to acts done under his command is without legal to consider whether plaintiff in error, being to considet whether plaintiff in error, being subject to the restraint of the decree of the state court in the Bilger suit as an agent of Erickson, one of the parties thereto, could, without modification of that decree, have successfully claimed immunity for a violation of the restraint upon the plea that he acted under the authority of the Federal government. Upon this question, therefore, we express no opinion.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","30":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCARONDELET CANAL & NAVIGATION CO. v. STATE OF LOUISIANA(1914)\nNo. 78\nArgued: Decided: April 20, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 362, 363]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edgar H. Farrar, Benjamin T. Waldo, and W. C. Dufour for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 362, 366]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ruffin G. Pleasant, Attorney General of Louisiana, and Mr. Daniel Wendling for defendant in error.\n\n\n[233 U.S. 362, 370]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Mckenna delivered the opinion of the court.\n The state of Louisiana brought this suit in the civil district court of the parish of Orleans, state of Louisiana, against the Carondelet Canal & Navigation Company of New Orleans (herein called the canal company) for the recovery from the company, through its liquidators, of the Carondelet canal, Bayon St. John, and Old Basin, a water way used by vessels for the transportation of freight and merchandise, and for its improvements and appurtenant properties.\n The suit was dismissed by the civil district court as premature. On appeal to the supreme court of the state, that court reversed the judgment dismissing the suit, and ordered that a judgment be entered against the canal company, in liquidation, ordering the delivery to the state of the canal and water way in their entirety, as they stood on March 10, 1908, together with all the property and improvements appurtenant thereto, including the roadway or roadways upon the side or sides of the canal.\n The claims of the state to a triangular strip of ground hereafter mentioned, or to the proceeds thereof, or to any other property, movable or immovable, not appurtenant to the water way and roadways, were reserved for further adjudication in the proceedings. And an accounting was ordered of the receipts and disbursements in the management of the property since March 10, 1908, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings on all questions reserved as above stated, and 'that the right of the plaintiff to obtain judgment for such \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 371]\n\u00a0\n amount as may be found due upon defendant's accounting, and to take such further proceedings and obtain such further orders as may be required for the execution of this judgment, be reserved.' 129 La. 279, 56 So. 137.\n We refer to the opinion of the supreme court for the history of the canal, which, while interesting, is quite long. There is no question of the source and orgin of the rights of the canal company; no question of the right of the state to take possession of the canal and its appurtenant properties upon complying with the contract alleged to exist between the state and the company. There is a question as to the extent of the rights of the company under the contract, and for what property the state must make compensation, and the factors in the solution of the question require quite an extended discussion.\n We are met, however, at the outset, by a motion to dismiss, on the ground that the judgment is not final.\n The judgment disposes of and orders the delivery of practically all of the property sued for: (1) The water way in its entirety; (2) all the property and improvements appurtenant to it, including the roadway or roadways upon the sides of it. It reserves property not appurtenant and an accounting of certain disbursements. The reservation concerns only a small piece of ground upon which there was a dispute as to whether it was appurtenant to the canal,-a question the court apparently could not determine, as it was a question of fact. All else will be taken from the canal company and delivered to the state. That is, all was decreed that it was the purpose of the suit to have decreed, and which not only constituted its success, but which involved and disposed of the Federal right asserted by the canal company. The judgment, therefore, has a substantial finality. Is it not as well in form?\n Cases are cited which, the state contends, require a negative answer to the question. They are distinguishable from that at bar. \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 372]\n\u00a0\n In Haseltine v. Central Nat. Bank, \n183 U.S. 130\n, 46 L. ed. 117, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 49, the action was against a national bank to recover under  5198 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3493), for usurious interest alleged to have been charged. There was judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the action. It was reversed by the supreme court of the state on the ground that he had neither paid nor tendered the principal sum, and the case was remanded for further proceedings. The case, therefore, was remanded for a new trial in its entirety. It was ruled that the face of the judgment is the test of its finality, and that this court, cannot be called on to inquire whether, when a cause is sent back, the defeated party might or might not make a better case.\n This rule was again expressed in Schlosser v. Hemphill, \n198 U.S. 173\n, 49 L. ed. 1000, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 654, in a case where a right to amend the pleadings existed and a new case could have been made.\n In Missouri & K. Interurban R. Co. v. Olathe, \n222 U.S. 185\n, 56 L. ed. 155, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 46, a demurrer was sustained to the plaintiff's pleadings in the trial court and the supreme court, but the latter court did not direct a dismissal of the suit, but left it stand in the court below. We held that the judgment sought to be reviewed was not one which finally determined the cause, and that we were without jurisdiction.\n In Louisiana Nav. Co. v. Oyster Commission, \n226 U.S. 99\n, 57 L. ed. 138, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 78, we repeated the test of finality to be the face of the judgment, and expressed the reason to be that this court cannot be called upon to review an action of the state court piecemeal. The language was appropriate to the condition presented by the case, for the pleading in the case was left open for amendment.\n In the case at bar there is distinct and explicit finality, and the further proceedings are directed to apply only to the 'questions reserved.' And it is to be assumed this was purposely done to give finality to the questions not reserved, so that the decree could be immediately executed \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 373]\n\u00a0\n upon the property involved requiring it to be delivered into the possession and administration of the state. This disposition, we can easily conceive, the court considered necessary to the rights which the state was adjudged to have, and the remedy commensurate with them. The decree, therefore, had a definiteness which did not exist in the cited cases, the Federal rights asserted by the canal company were injuriously disposed of. The ground of dismissal of the writ of error based on the judgment is not, therefore, sustained.\n There are other grounds urged, to wit, that no Federal question is shown, and that, besides, the decision of the court below was rested on a non-Federal ground sufficient to sustain it. A consideration of this involves the issues in the case and their determination.\n The suit involves, as we have said, the right to the canal and its appurtenant properties, and the controversy between the parties turns upon the construction of two acts of the legislature of the state, passed, respectively, in 1857 and 1858. Those acts will be referred to hereafter with some particularity. By virtue of those acts the canal company derived its rights and its corporate existence. The petition of the state presents the following propositions: (1) The act of 1857 gave the canal company a corporate existence of twenty-five years from October 17, 1857, with power in the state to take possession of the canal and appurtenant properties. If the state should not exercise such right at such time, then the company was to have existence for a second term of twenty-five years, at which time the canal and its appurtenant properties were to be surrendered to the state without compensation to be paid to the company. (2) By the act of 1858 the charter existence of the company was extended to fifty years, and at the expiration of such period the property was to be surrendered to the state without the necessity of compensation being made \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 374]\n\u00a0\n therefor. (3) In 1906, in order that the state should be in a position to assume control and take possession of the property, the legislature passed an act creating a board of control of the canal, to be appointed by the governor. This board was appointed and the property demanded. (4) The company refused to comply with the demand on the ground that the state had not complied with certain alleged contract obligations which the canal company claimed under  4 of the act of 1858, and which gave it greater rights to the property than did the act of 1857, and until such obligations were performed the company would refuse to deliver the property. (5) If such was the effect of the act of 1858, the act was void as being in violation of the constitution of the state; especially of articles 108 and 109, which prohibited the granting of aid by the state to companies and corporations formed for the purpose of making works of public improvement. And further, if the company have the right to demand compensation, it has no right to claim against the state the property and improvements connected with or which belong to the Carondelet canal, the Bayou St. John, and the Old Basin on Toulouse street, the state being sole owner of that part of the property. (6) The New Orleans Terminal Company, in a suit to expropriate a triangular piece of ground upon which stood the office building of the company, was condemned to pay $3,000, which sum was deposited in bank by agreement to await the determination of whether the state or the company should be entitled thereto. (7) The company has collected tolls through its liquidators since the expiration of its charter.\n The state prayed an accounting of the revenues of the property after the expiration of the charter of the company, and that all the property and improvements connected with and appurtenant thereto, including the $3, 000, the proceeds of the triangular piece of ground \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 375]\n\u00a0\n referred to above, be delivered to the board of control created by the act of 1906, to be administered through the board.\n Exceptions were filed to the petition of the state, and having been overruled an answer was filed. We need give only its basic allegations. They present, after denying the allegations of the petition of the state, the following propositions: (1) The state had no interest in the canal except under the contract between the canal company and the state, constituted of the acts of 1857 and 1858. (2) In 1857 the legislature, after anticipating the inability of a company called the New Orleans Canal & Navigation Company to carry out the terms of the purchase of the property under an act passed in 1852, passed the act of 1857, and that under those acts the canal company became possessed of the property. By  4 of the act of 1858 (hereafter set out) it was provided that the company should have corporate existence during fifty years from the date of the act, after which time it might revert to the state upon due compensation being made according to award by three commissioners. (3) If the act of 1906 can be construed to authorize the board of control to take possession of the property without compensating the company therefor, it violates the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States. (4) The state never claimed any right or property in or to the canal and the improvements respectively made thereon by the Orleans Navigation Company and its successors, and whatever rights the state has are derived solely from the contracts between it and the canal company, as defined in the acts of 1857 and 1858. The state never spent a dollar on the canal, the basin, or the bayou, but the canal company has spent thereon a sum exceeding $750,000.\n The state, as we have said, made a motion to dismiss on two grounds, one of which we have decided; the other is \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 376]\n\u00a0\n that no Federal question is presented by the record, the canal company failing to distinguish, it is contended, between a subsequent act of the legislature impairing the contract, and the decision of the court construing it. The question, then, is whether the act of 1906, appointing the board of control and investing it with powers, was an act which impaired the obligation of the contract; and in the solution of the question we must assume that the act of 1858 constituted a contract between the state and the canal company. The negative of the question is urged by the attorney general in an argument of strength in which he contends the court did not consider or give any effect to the act of 1906, but considered only the act of 1858, and decided that the canal company did not acquire the rights under it which the company contends for. In other words, decided that the act of 1858 gave no rights which the state did not already have, and which it was entitled to possess upon the expiration of the charter of the canal company. There is, as we have said, strength in the contention; but, of course, the fact that the supreme court did not refer to the act of 1906 does not put it aside from consideration. If it was the assertion of legislative power against the contract of the company, and a legislative provision against the obligation of the contract, and was an essential, although unmentioned, element of the decision under review, it is a basis in the Federal question set up. Nor need bad motives be imputed to the legislature. It is not the motive which caused the enactment of the law which is of account, but the effect of the enactment, impairing the rights resting in the contract. And this, we think, was the effect of the act of 1906. It was treated as an important factor in the state's petition in both the charging part and the prayer. The board of control had something else to do besides to wait. It was an agency of invasion, and it was by its especial command that the attorney general made demand upon the com- \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 377]\n\u00a0\n pany. And in this the board exercised the power given it; and to remove the impediments to the exercise of the power, 'all laws and parts of laws in conflict with' the act of 1906, which conferred the power, were repealed. The repeal of a law which constitutes a contract is an impair-\n'Messrs. A. J. Davidson, J. H. Elliott, and Hans Widmer, liquidators of the Carondelet Canal & Navigation Company, of New Orleans, Louisiana:\n\n'Dear Sirs:--\n\n'In view of the fact that the time during which the Carondelet Canal & Navigation Company of New Orleans has had the right to enjoy the possession and control of the Carondelet canal and Bayou St. John, together with the Old Basin, with all of the revenue derived therefrom, has expired, and that it becomes the duty of the state of Louisiana, through the board of control for the Bayou St. John and Carondelet canal and Old Basin, to take possession of the said Carondelet cannal, Bayou St. John, and Old Basin, together with all the property and improvements connected therewith, or in any wise thereto belonging or appertaining, in order that the same may be controlled, managed, and administered by said board, for the use and benefit of the state, and in view of the further fact that, at a meeting of said board of control, held on the 1st day of October, 1908, a resolution was adopted requesting me, as attorney general of the state, to take such action as, in my judgment, would be proper to 'have the state put into possession of the Bayou St. John, Carondelet canal, and Old Basin, and all its properties and rights,' I now hereby make formal demand upon you to deliver into the possession and control of the said board of control of the Bayou St. John and Carondelet canal and Old Basin the said Bayou St. John and Carondelet canal and Old Basin, together with all the properties and improvements connected therewith or in any wise thereto belonging or appertaining. In default of your complying with this formal demand within a reasonable delay, I now notify you that I will institute suit for the purpose of recovering for the state, to be controlled, managed, and operated by the board of control aforesaid, the said Carondelet canal and Bayou St. John and Old Basin, together with all the properties and improvements connected therewith or thereto belonging or appertaining.\n\n'Be pleased to let me hear from you at your earliest convenience, and oblige,\n\n'Yours truly,\n\n (Signed) 'Walter Guion.\n'Attorney General.' \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 378]\n\u00a0\n ment of its obligation. 'It may be laid down as a general principle that whenever a law is in its own nature a contract, and absolute rights have vested under it, a repeal of it cannot divest those rights, or annihilate or impair the title so acquired.' 2 Story, Const.  1391. The provision of the Constitution against the impairment of the obligation of contracts was intended 'to prohibit every mode or device having such purpose. The prohibition is universal. It attempted no enumeration of the modes by which contracts might be impaired. It would have been unwise to have made such enumeration, since it might have been defective.' Id.  1386. The precaution was necessary. The prohibition is directed against the exertions of sovereignty which the citizens, unless protected by the organic law, would be impotent to resist, whether boldly declared in an explicit law or disguised in an ambiguous form. This case is an illustration. Here is a property sought to be taken from the canal company, and there can be no doubt that the board of control, through the affirmative and repealing provisions of the act of 1906, was to be the instrument and moving agency. The motion to dismiss must, therefore, be denied, and we are brought to the merits of the controversy-Did the acts of 1857 and 1858 constitute a contract?\n\n In the consideration of that question we do not think it is necessary to discuss with any particularity the contributions, respectively, of the state and the canal company and its predecessors to the construction of the canal and its appurtenant properties. The case exhibits from the first conception and commencement of the enterprise by Governor Carondelet through its successive development and extension the interest the state had in its accomplishment and the difficulties which had to be overcome, two corporations going down to insolvency in the undertaking, the state being compelled to resume the \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 379]\n\u00a0\n powers it had conferred, and make provision for granting them to more efficient instruments. In these circumstances we find the impelling causes of the act of 1857\n\n\n A word or two of the act of 1852 becomes pertinent. It provided that in case of a judgment of forfeiture against the Orleans Navigation Company a liquidating commissioner should be appointed who should take possession of the entire property of the company, real and personal, movable and immovable, and, after advertisement, sell the same in block at public auction. The conditions of sale were that the purchasers should 'organize themselves into a corporation under the laws of the state for the period of twenty-five years for the purpose of carrying out and effecting all the improvements detailed and described in the reports and plans known as Harrison's reports and plans, including the construction of a new basin at the junction of Canal Carondelet and Bayou St. John, of the depths and dimensions set forth in said reports,' and to actually complete them within the term of three years from the date of the charter of the corporation. It was provided that at the end of the term of twenty-five years the state should have the option of granting a renewal of the right of receiving the tolls for a second term of twenty-five years, or of purchasing for itself 'the property and the improvements of the company' at the appraised value thereof, and provided further that if the said term of twenty-five years be granted, the whole property should revert to the state at the end of the second term, without any payment of compensation made to the company. Work and improvements were to be commenced within six months and completed within six years, otherwise the right, title, and interest acquired, together with the improvements that might be made, should vest in and belong to the state. The purchasers organized themselves into a corporation called the New Orleans Canal & Navigation Company.\n * \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 380]\n\u00a0\n Then came the act of 1857. It organized the present canal company, making the capital stock of the company $500,000. The company was authorized to take possession of the canal for the purpose of completing the works of improvement undertaken and commenced by the New Orleans Canal & Navigation Company under the provisions of the act of 1852. The canal company was given authority to depart from the plan 'of the improvement of said canal and bayou,' designated as 'Harrison's plan,' so far as the plan proposes a basin at the junction of the said canal with the bayou, if the board of directors should determine that such works were not demanded by the interests, safety, or convenience of commerce.\n It was provided that in case of the New Orleans Canal & Navigation Company's failure to perform the obligations undertaken by it, suit should be instituted to forfeit its coarter, franchises, and privileges and property, including the interest in the Canal Carondelet and Bayou St. John and the works done and effected therein, which, after appraisement, should be sold and payment made therefor in the stock of the new corporation, the canal company. With expressions of detail, it was provided that the new company might take and have all and singular the rights, privileges, franchises, immunities, powers, and authority which had been at any time granted to and possessed and exercised by the Orleans Navigation Company under  9-13 of the act of 1805, and those possessed and exercised under the acts of 1850 and 1852 by the New Orleans Canal & Navigation Company. The new company was to assume all of the debts and obligations imposed on the old one by the act of 1852, except in so far as the provisions of said act were modified or changed in and by the act of 1857.\n The canal company was required to complete the works required by the act of 1852 within three years from and after the 17th of October, 1857, subject to the \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 381]\n\u00a0\n modification provided, and in the case of failure the franchise, rights, privileges, and immunities granted should cease and be forfeited to and become the property of the state.\n The canal company was given an existence of twenty-five years from and after the 17th of October, 1857, 'provided that the state of Louisiana shall have the right to take possession of said Canal Carondelet and Bayou St. John, and all the property connected therewith, at the expiration of the term above mentioned, should the legislature determine so to do, paying to this corporation the value of said property, to be appraised by five competent persons, as experts, two to be appointed by this corporation and two by the governor, and the four thus appointed shall appoint a fifth; said experts shall be required to take an oath to discharge their duty faithfully. In the event that the state shall not determine to take possession of said property, as herein provided, then this corporation shall be in existence for twenty-five years from and after the expiration of the term in this section mentioned aforesaid, and at the end of such second term of twenty-five years, the said property shall become absolutely the property of the state of Louisiana, and no compensation required to be made to this corporation.'\n The act of 1858 comes next to be considered. It gives the right to construct layouts, basins, and half moons, for steam and any other water craft on the Bayou St. John, the basin and canal, and to extend them, provided public roads be constructed around them and be kept subject to the ordinance of the city of New Orleans.\n The company was given ( 2) the right to construct a railroad, with single or double track, on either side of the basin, canal, and Bayou St. John from the head of the basin, on Toulouse street, to the lake end, and transport freight and passengers for hire, and employ steam loco- \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 382]\n\u00a0\n motives within such limts of the city as the common council may prescribe.\n After five years from the passage of the act, the city was prohibited from draining in the bayou except upon payment of indemnity. And the city is given the right to build bridges over the canal and bayou.\n Section 4 is as follows: 'That the said company shall enjoy corporate succession during fifty years from this date; after which time it [italics ours] may revert to the state, upon due compensation being made according to award, by three commissioners, one appointed by the governor of the state, one by the company, and the third by any court of record of New Orleans.'\n By subsequent section the company is given the right to tow vessels; exclusive power to carry out their works in conformity with such plan or plans as it may at any time adopt and deem best calculated to forward the interests of commerce; to impose fines for violation of its rules; to issue bonds and to secure them by hypothecating and mortgaging 'all its property, privileges, and immunities whatever,' the amount of bonds not to exceed $250,000; and the company shall be exempt from taxation.\n The controversy centers in  4 and turns upon the antecedent to the pronoun 'it' in the sentence 'after which time it may revert to the state.'\n The natural and grammatical use of a relative pronoun is to put it in close relation with its antecedent, its purpose being to connect the antecedent with a descriptive phrase. In the provision under discussion 'it' stands in the place of something that is to revert to the state, and following, therefore, the natural and grammatical use of 'it,' its antecedent would be the noun 'company' (said company). The supreme court of the state, however, considered that there was ambiguity in the relation of 'it' and rejected 'company' as the antecedent, and observed \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 383]\n\u00a0\n that it could not relate to any of the things provided for in succeeding sections nor to the 'layouts, basins, and half moons' mentioned in  1, and decided that the antecedent was the railroad authorized to be constructed by the canal company by  2. The court, after elaborate argument, expressed the view that the company could not revert to the state, and, as it had no property in the canal and its appurtenances, the only thing which could revert to the state was the railroad. 'Whether this be the true solution of the problem or not,' the court said, 'we are unable to find anything else in the act of 1858 than the railroad to which the relative 'it,' as used in  4, can in any way be made to relate.' And it was further said that there being nothing else to which 'it' could relate other than the railroad, and that, 'having never been built, can afford no basis for . . . [its] demand for compensation and for a continuance of its possession of public property.'\n We are unable to concur in the learned court's conclusion. We have already pointed out that the first companies organized went down successively in bankruptcy. Neither the rights given them nor the purpose for which they were given averted financial disaster. The same rights and property, in the main contingent upon the same conditions, were conferred upon the canal company, the record shows, by the act of 1857, but they offered no prospect of success, and the company was about to abandon its charter, when the act of 1858 was passed. It was effective, and its effectiveness must have been due to the additive rights which it conferred and the security which it gave them. We have stated its provision and those of the acts which preceded it. Let us repeat them, for in them we shall find the answer to the question whether any property existed in the canal company which could revert to the state, under  4 of the act of 1858, except the railroad. For the answer we need not go farther back than \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 384]\n\u00a0\n 1852. In the act of that year the rights and property of the Orleans Navigation Company were conveyed through its liquidators after proper legal proceedings to certain individuals who were to organize themselves into a corporation for the term of twenty-five years, which was to undertake the construction of the work, with an option on the part of the state to grant a renewal of rights for another term of twenty-five years, 'or of purchasing for itself the property and improvements of the company at the appraised value thereof.' In case of the grant of a second term, at its end 'the whole property' was to revert to the state 'without any payment or compensation made to said company.'\n These provisions are a recognition of a property interest in the canal which would be acquired by the corporation that was to be organized. This is put beyond doubt by a subsequent provision. If the corporation did not complete the work in the time the act designated, it was provided that 'all right, title, and interest acquired by the purchaser, under the provisions of this act, together with any improvements that may be made, shall vest in and belong to the state.'\n The corporation was organized, as we have said, and became the New Orleans Canal & Navigation Company. The latter company failing to perform its undertaking, the Carondelet Canal & Navigation Company, plaintiff in error, was, under the act of 1857, organized, and possession of the property was given to it for the purpose and with the rights, powers, and privileges as provided in the act of 1857. There was a provision in that act, as we have seen, as in the act of 1852, for successive corporate terms of twenty-five years. At the end of the first term the state should 'have the right to take possession of said Canal Carondelet and Bayou St. John, and all the property and improvements connected therewith, . . . should the legislature determine so to do, upon paying the value \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 385]\n\u00a0\n thereof,' to be appraised in the manner provided. If the state did not elect to purchase the property as provided, the second term of twenty-five years began, at the end of which it was provided that the 'said property may still become absolutely the property of the state of Louisiana, and no compensation required to be made' to the canal company.\n These provisions were idle-barren of everything but mischief and misleading effect-if the contention now made is tenable that the canal company, and necessarily as well its predecessors in the work, could acquire no property because the Bayou St. John was navigable water and the improvements had become appurtenant to it. Under the comprehensiveness of the contention there were no 'property and improvements' to appraise or purchase, although the act declared there were both; there was no property to revert to the state, although the act provided for it, and took the precaution of excluding the requirement of paying for it. These circumstantial provisions cannot be misunderstood. They were not a precaution against the assertion of unfounded rights; they were the recognition of rights to be purchased and paid for in one contingency, to revert to the state without 'compensation made' in the other contingency.\n There was something more, then, than a prospective railroad for 'it' to relate to, and we might consider the contention of the state disposed of without the necessity of further discussion. The supreme court recognized that as 'the act of 1858 contains no repealing clause, and the act of 1857 is in pari materia, the search for the vagrant antecedent [it was so considered by the court] might be prosecuted in the last-mentioned statute.' The court, however, did not locate the antecedent there because of the view that the railroad was the only property that the canal company had which could revert to the state. But, we have seen, there was property provided \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 386]\n\u00a0\n for in the act of 1857 substantial enough to have value to be appraised and purchased; substantial enough, therefore, to revert to the state. Not, it may be, property to be considered the antecedent looked for, but significantly determining it to be something else than the railroad, which was but a subordinate instrument in the scheme, and which might or might not be built.\n The rights and property conveyed and provided for by the act of 1857 were then of substance and value, and yet the enterprise halted. We need not conjecture the cause. It is manifest that the failures of the past warned against the conditions of the act of 1857. A large sum of money was necessary. It was conceived it might be as much as $500,000, and to encourage its investment the act of 1858 was passed. This being its purpose, whatever changes it made in the act of 1857 it must be construed as having been adopted to effect such purpose. A prominent fact in it was that it contemplated a greater expenditure than the capital of the company, and authorized an issue of bonds of not exceeding $250,000. It is true that it was provided that the sum should be employed upon the improvement of the navigation of the canal and the building of the railroad; but, notwithstanding, the authorization of the bonds indicates the conception of the amount necessary for the undertaking.\n The act of 1858 made other changes to which we have referred, and it may be assumed that all of them were of some value to the state or to the company or to both. The supreme court assigned a special value to the power given to the company to adopt its own plans instead of being confined to the Harrison report and plans. The record, however, affords no basis of estimating the importance of this choice; besides, by the act of 1857, the company had been authorized to depart from Harrison's plans in certain particulars, and what would have remained of them after exercises of the right we have no means of* \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 387]\n\u00a0\n knowing. But it was certainly not intended by the discretion conferred to give the company power to construct the works in a cheap and inefficient manner, and it is not intimated that the discretion was not wisely conferred or not wisely exercised.\n We must look, therefore, for some other motive for the act of 1858, and we think, as said by Mr. Justice Provosty in his dissenting opinion, that it 'will be sought for in vain, unless it is to be found in the purpose of prolonging the unconditional life of the company and the doing away with the clause for the reversion of its property without compensation.' This conclusion is fortified by the structure of the act and the relation of its parts. We have seen that the natural and grammatical antecedent of 'it' in  4 is 'said company,' and that it was the intentional antecedent is clear from the French version of the statute, the practice of the state at that time being to publish statutes in French and English.\n The use of 'elle' in the French version is of strong significance. There is no neuter gender in the French language, every noun is masculine or feminine, and the pronoun which stands for it must agree with it in gender as in English; but in French there is more certain indication of the ante cedent. The neuter it relative to a noun is il or elle, and therefore the use of elle in French version points unmistakably to an antecedent of the same gender-to 'cette compagnie,' and not to 'un chemin de fer.' Thus, wholly aside from which text is controlling, the context of both versions removes all doubt as to the meaning of the laws.\n It is true, in a sense, that the company could not revert, for as a legal entity it would expire; but what it represented and possessed could revert,-the result of its investments and energies, the property it had acquired under legislative sanction and the property it had created under like sanction. The company stood for its attributes and property. \n\n[233 U.S. 362, 388]\n\u00a0\n It may be that it did not own the canal, or the bayou, or the old basin. Indeed, ownership of their soil was disclaimed at the bar. But, we repeat, there was valuable property which the statute contemplated could revert and could be compensated for. Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United States, \n148 U.S. 312\n, 37 L. ed. 463, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 622.\n The attorney general separates in his argument the canal, the bayou, and the old basin from the other properties, and urges that at least as to them the state is entitled to take possession. And he seems to concede that the act of 1858 contemplated payment to the canal company not only for the railroad, but also for the 'layouts, basins, and half-moons,'- giving 'it' an antecedent of greater scope than did the supreme court. To the contention, however, that a distinction may be made between the properties, it must be answered that neither the act of 1857 nor that of 1858 makes such a distinction. The language of the act of 1858 is comprehensive and provides that all which is represented by 'it' 'may revert to the state upon due compensation being made according to award.' And the same answer must be made to the contention that the company only has a lease of the properties, and that its relation to the state being that of lessee, it, therefore, 'has no defense to the state's demand for possession of the property.' Whatever the relation created, payment of compensation was a condition precedent of the reversion to the state. It certainly was not intended to remit the canal company to a claim against the state. How would it be enforced against the resistance of the state, the sovereignty of the state giving immunity from suit?\n Judgment is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","31":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHAPMAN & DEWEY LUMBER CO. v. BOARD OF DIRECTORS ST FRANCIS LEVEE(1914)\nNo. 82\nArgued: Decided: June 22, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. Samuel Adams, H. F. Roleson, J. C. Hawthorne, and N. F. Lamb in support of petition.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n Leave to file a petition for rehearing is sought in this case. The petition has been examined, and we find it so wanting in merit that leave to file it must be denied. Doubtless a formal denial would suffice, but we prefer to notice two statements in the petition.\n As our opinion (\n232 U.S. 186\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 297) shows, the controlling question was whether a patent issued to the state of Arkansas in 1858 under the swamp-land act embraced all the lands within the exterior boundaries of a designated \n\n[234 U.S. 667, 668]\n\u00a0\n township, or only the lands lying without certain meander lines shown upon the official plat which, by reference, was made part of the description in the patent. The plat showed that large areas in the township, amounting to 8,000 acres or more, were meandered as bodies of water called 'sunk lands,' and that the remaining areas were surveyed into sections and parts of sections, the aggregate of which, according to an inscription upon the plat, was 14,329.97 acres. Deducting from the latter 514.30 acres in fractional section 16, which had passed to the state under the school-land grant, left 13,815.67 acres, and this was the acreage given in the patent, from which section 16 was excepted. The mode of claiming lands under the swampland act was by presenting selection lists to the surveyor general, and, as bearing upon what was intended to be conveyed by the patent, we stated that the list in this instance 'described the township as containing 14,329.97 acres, the total of the surveyed areas as inscribed upon the plat,' and that this, less the 514.30 acres in fractional section 16, was the area given in the patent.\n One of the statements in the petition for rehearing is that our opinion 'proceeds on the hypothesis, unsupported by the record,' that the governor of Arkansas, in his request for the patenting of the township in question, stated its acreage. In assuming that it is our duty to deal with the case as it is disclosed by the record, counsel are clearly right. A like obligation rests upon counsel. The record (p. 207) contains a certificate from the General Land Office, introduced in evidence without objection, saying: 'The original selection list of swamp lands in T. 12 N., R. 7 E., [the township in question] gives the area of the township as 14, 329.97 acres, and that amount was also given in the approved list. Section 16, which passed to the state under the school grant, contains 514.30 acres, and as such lands were not granted under the swamp-land laws, the area of section 16 was deducted from the \n\n[234 U.S. 667, 669]\n\u00a0\n total of the township, leaving 13,815.67 acres, which amount was accounted for in the patent.' The certificate stood uncontradicted in the record and was accepted by the supreme court of the state as determinative of the facts recited in it (100 Ark. 97, 139 S. W. 625). Nothing more need be said upon this point.\n Another statement in the petition is that we erred in treating the meandered areas embodying the lands in controversy as unsurveyed lands. The record (p. 1) shows that the complaint filed in the court of first instance, and which counsel seek to maintain, alleged that these lands 'were left unsurveyed by the United States government.' The sunk lands were also described by the representative of the state as 'not yet surveyed,' when the state's claims under the swamp-land grant were being adjusted and settled in 1895. H. R. Rep. No. 1634, 54th Cong. 1st Sess. pp. 5 and 32. This will suffice upon this point. Leave to file petition denied. \n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHAPMAN & DEWEY LUMBER CO. v. ST FRANCIS LEVEE DIST(1914)\nNo. 82\nArgued: December 12, 1913Decided: January 26, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 186, 187]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry D. Ashley and William S. Gilbert for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 186, 190]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Samuel Adams, H. F. Roleson, J. C. Hawthorne, and N. F. Lamb for defendant in error.\n\n\n[232 U.S. 186, 194]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n The chief controversy in this case is over the title to about 1,500 acres of unsurveyed lands in Poinsett county, Arkansas, which were part of the public domain at the date of the swamp-land act of September 28, 1850 ( 9 Stat. at L. 519, chap. 84), and the Federal question to be considered is whether, under the operation and administration of that act, these lands have passed from the United States, or are still its property.\n Although within the exterior lines of a township surveyed in 1840 and 1841, they, with other lands, were excluded from the survey, were meandered as if they were a lake, and were designated upon the official plat as a meandered body of water called 'Sunk Lands,'-a name frequently applied in that region to areas which subsided during the New Madrid earthquake, a little more than a century ago, and subsequently became submerged. Other unsurveyed areas, designated as meandered bodies of water, were also shown upon the plat. The township was approximately 6 miles square, and the plat bore an inscription to the effect that the total of the surveyed areas was 14,329.97 acres, so the unsurveyed areas represented as water must have amounted to 8,000 acres or more.\n After the enactment of the swamp-land act, the state requested that the township be listed as swamp lands, and patented to it under that act, both of which were done, the former in 1853 and the latter in 1858. In requesting the listing, the state described the township as containing 14, 329.97 acres, the total of the surveyed areas as inscribed upon the plat, and in making the list, the Secretary of the Interior took the same total and deducted 514.30 acres in fractional section 16, which already had passed to the state under the school-land grant, \n\n[232 U.S. 186, 195]\n\u00a0\n thereby making the listed area 13,815.67 acres. The patent embraced lands in several townships, the portion of the description material here being: 'Township 12 north of range 7 east. The whole of the township (except section 16), containing thirteen thousand, eight hundred and fifteen acres and sixty-seven hundredths of an acre . . . according to the official plats of survey of said lands returned to the General Land Office by the Surveyor General.'\n In the state courts the levee district, the plaintiff, claimed title to the lands in controversy under the swamp-land act and an act of the state legislature in 1893 (Laws [Ark.] 1893, p. 172), granting to the levee district 'all the lands of this state' lying within the boundaries of the district; and the defendants opposed this claim upon two grounds: One, that if these lands had passed to the state, the defendants had succeeded to the title by riparian right in virtue of their ownership, under conveyances from the state in 1871, of the fractional sections and subdivisions abutting on the meandered area called 'Sunk Lands;' and the other, that the lands in controversy had not passed to the state, but were still the property of the United States. The trial court sustained the plaintiff's claim and entered a decree accordingly, which was affirmed by the supreme court of the state, the chief justice dissenting. 100 Ark. 94, 139 S. W. 625.\n Both courts found as matter of fact from the evidence produced at the trial that at the time of the survey and at the date of the swamp-land act the unsurveyed area designated upon the plat as 'Sunk Lands' was not a lake or permanent body of water, but only temporarily overflowed, and was not distinctly lower or materially different from the adjoining lands; and with this as a premise it was held that the lands in controversy did not pass to the state or to the defendants with the adjoining lands as an incident of riparian ownership, but were con- \n\n[232 U.S. 186, 196]\n\u00a0\n veyed to the state by the patent issued in 1858, and thence to the levee district by the state act of 1893\n\n\n If the patent conveyed these lands to the state, we are not concerned with their subsequent disposal, for that is a question of local law. But did the patent include them? This, of course, is a Federal question. In answering it in the affirmative, the state courts regarded the words 'Sunk Lands,' shown upon the plat, as meaning that unsurveyed area to which they were applied was land, and not water, and also regarded the words, 'The whole of the township (except section 16),' as used in the patent, as embracing all that was within the exterior lines of the township, except section 16, whether surveyed or unsurveyed, and even although meandered and excluded from the survey. We are unable to accede to this view of either the plat or the patent.\n Had the plat shown that all the lands were surveyed, it doubtless is true that the words 'Sunk Lands' would not have indicated the presence of a body of water, but would have been taken in much the same way as would such words as 'valley,' 'broken hills,' or 'level plateau.' But the plat showed, as did also the field notes, that the area to which the words were applied was not included in the survey, but was excluded therefrom, and meandered as a body of water, and also that the adjoining sections and subdivisions were surveyed as fractional, as is usual with lands abutting on a lake or similar body of water. Thus, what appeared upon the plat had the same meaning as if this area had been called 'Sunk Lands Lake.' And that the officers of the state and of the United States so understood is shown by the fact that in the proceedings preliminary to the issuance of the patent, as also in the patent, this and similar areas were excluded in specifying the amount of land in the township.\n Of course, the words in the patent, 'The whole of the township ( except section 16),' are comprehensive, \n\n[232 U.S. 186, 197]\n\u00a0\n but they are only one element in the description, and must be read in the light of the others. The explanatory words, 'according to the official plats of survey of said lands, returned to the General Land Office by the Surveyor General,' constitute another element, and a very important one; for it is a familiar rule that where lands are patented according to such a plat, the notes, lines, landmarks, and other particulars appearing thereon become as much a part of the patent, and are as much to be considered in determining what it is intended to include, as if they were set forth in the patent. Cragin v. Powell, \n128 \nU.S. 691, 696\n, 32 S. L. ed. 566, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 203; Jefferis v. East Omaha Land Co. \n134 \nU.S. 178, 194\n, 33 S. L. ed. 872, 878, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 518. The specification of the screage is still another element; and, while of less influence than either of the others, it is yet an aid in ascertaining what was intended; for a purpose to convey upwards of 22,000 acres is hardly consistent with a specification of 13,815.67 acres. Ainsa v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 208, 229\n, 40 S. L. ed. 673, 680, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 544; Security Land & Exploration Co. v. Burns, \n193 \nU.S. 167, 180\n, 48 S. L. ed. 662, 671, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 425; 3 Washb. Real Prop. 5th ed. 427. Giving to cach of these elements its appropriate influence, and bearing in mind that the terms of description are all such as are usually employed in designating surveyed lands, we are of opinion that the purpose was to patent the whole of the lands surveyed, except fractional section 16, and not the areas meandered and returned, as shown upon the plat, as bodies of water. That it is now found, as shown by the decisions below, that these areas ought not to have been so meandered and returned, but should have been surveyed and returned as land, does not detract from the effect which must be given to the plat in determining what was intended to pass under the patent. Niles v. Cedar Point Club, \n175 \nU.S. 300, 306\n, 44 S. L. ed. 171, 173, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 124; Hardin v. Shedd, \n190 \nU.S. 508, 520\n, 47 S. L. ed. 1156, 1158, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 685.\n As, then, the lands in controversy were not included in the patent, and, under the findings below, did not pass to the state or to the defendants by riparian right with the \n\n[232 U.S. 186, 198]\n\u00a0\n adjoining fractional sections and subdivisions, it follows that they remain the property of the United States.

Burns, supra.\n But it is said on behalf of the levee district that, even though the lands were not included in the patent, they passed to the state under the swamp-land act independently of any patent, and passed thence to the district under the state act of 1893. The contention is not tenable. The lands were never listed as swamp lands, and their listing does not appear to have been even requested; doubtless because they were not surveyed. Assuming that in fact they were swamp lands, the state's title under the swamp-land act was at most inchoate, and never was perfected. Not only so, but the state relinquished its inchoate title to the United States as part of a compromise and settlement negotiated in 1895, and the relinquishment is binding upon the levee district as a subordinate agency of the state.

THOMPSON(1914)\nNo. 751\nArgued: Decided: June 22, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. F. Barron Grier, W. K. Miller, and T. P. Cothran for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. William H. Fleming for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff, Lizzie Thompson, sued the railroad company, the plaintiff in error, to recover for personal injuries inflicted upon her while she was a passenger upon a train that was carrying her from South Carolina to Georgia. The railroad pleaded that she was traveling on a free \n\n[234 U.S. 576, 577]\n\u00a0\n pass that exempted the company from liability, the same having been issued to her gratuitously under the Hepburn act of June 29, 1906, chap. 3591,  1 [34 Stat. at L. 584, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1288], as wife of an employee. This plea was struck out, subject to the defendant's exception. The defendant also asked for an instruction that if the plaintiff was traveling on a free pass providing that the railroad should not be liable for negligent injury to her person, she could not recover. This was refused and was made a ground for a motion for a new trial, referring to the act of Congress. The motion was overruled seemingly on the notion that by the state law the defendant was liable within the conditions of the free pass. The court of appeals held such a stipulation binding in a free pass, but held that the Hepburn act created an exception, and that a so-called free pass under that act, issued to a member of an employee's family, really was not a free pass, but was issued upon consideration of the services of the employee. After this writ of error was taken it modified its statement so as to say that the jury might infer that the pass was issued for value. But no such issue was before the jury, as the defense had been excluded altogether, and apart from other objections we are of opinion that the change does not help the decision. The railroad company assigns the construction of the court of appeals and the two rulings below as error. There is a motion to dismiss, but we are of opinion that a question is presented under the act.\n The main question is whether, when the statute permits the issue of a 'free pass' to its employees and their families, it means what it says. The railroad was under no obligation to issue the pass. It may be doubted whether it could have entered into one, for then the services would be the consideration for the duty and the pass, and by  2 it was forbidden to charge 'a greater or less or different compensation' for transportation of passengers from that in its published rates. The antithesis in the statute is \n\n[234 U.S. 576, 578]\n\u00a0\n between the reasonable charges to be shown in its schedules and the free passes which it may issue only to those specified in the act. To most of those enumerated the free pass obviously would be gratuitous in the strictest sense, and when all that may receive them are grouped in a single exception, we think it plain that the statute contemplates the pass as gratuitous in the same sense to all. It follows, or rather is saying the same thing in other words, that even on the improbable speculation that the possibility of getting an occasional free pass entered into the motives of the employee in working for the road, the law did not contemplate his work as a conventional inducement for the pass, but, on the contrary, contemplated the pass as being what it called itself, free.\n As the pass was free under the statute, there is no question of the validity of its stipulations. This was conceded by the court of appeals, as we have stated, and is established by the decisions of this court. Northern P. R. Co. v. Adams, \n192 U.S. 440\n, 48 L. ed. 513, 24 Sup. Ct.

Byrd for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 146, 149]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an action begun in the circuit court of Clark county, Kentucky, by an administrator, to recover \n\n[232 U.S. 146, 150]\n\u00a0\n damages for the death of his intestate, the defendants being a railway company and the engineer and fireman of one of its trains which struck and fatally injured the intestate at or near a public crossing in Winchester, Kentucky. The administrator, engineer, and fireman were citizens of Kentucky, and the railway company was a Virginia corporation. The latter in due time presented to the court a verified petition and proper bond for the removal of the cause into the circuit court of the United States, but the court declined to surrender its jurisdiction, and, over the company's protest, proceeded to a trial which resulted in a judgment against the company, and the court of appeals of the state affirmed the judgment, including the ruling upon the petition for removal. 144 Ky. 137, 137 S. W. 1066\n\n\n The sole question for decision here is, whether it was error thus to proceed to an adjudication of the cause notwithstanding the company's effort to remove it into the Federal court.\n Rightly understood and much abbreviated, the plaintiff's petition, after stating that the train was being operated by the engineer and fireman as employees of the railway company, charged that the injury and death of the intestate were caused by the negligence of the defendants (a) in failing to maintain an adequate lookout ahead of the engine, (b) in failing to maintain any lookout upon the left or fireman's side, from which the intestate went upon the track, (c) in failing to give any warning of the approach of the train, and (d) in continuing to run the train forward after it struck the intestate, and was pushing her along, until it eventually ran over and fatally injured her, when it easily could have been stopped in time to avoid material injury. There was a prayer for a judgment against the three defendants for $25,000, the amount of damages alleged.\n The railway company's petition for removal, while not \n\n[232 U.S. 146, 151]\n\u00a0\n denying that the engineer and fireman were in the employ of the company, or that they were operating the train when it struck and injured the intestate, did allege that the charges of negligence (all being specifically repeated) against the defendants were each and all 'false and untrue, and were known by the plaintiff, or could have been known by the exercise of ordinary diligence, to be false and untrue, and were made for the sole and fraudulent purpose of affording a basis, if possible, for the fraudulent joinder' of the engineer and fireman with the railway company, and of 'thereby fraudulently depriving' the latter of its right to have the action removed into the Federal court; and that none of the charges of negligence on the part of the engineer or fireman could be sustained on the trial.\n It will be perceived that but for the joinder of the two employees as codefendants with the railway company, the latter undoubtedly would have been entitled to remove the cause into the Federal court on the ground of diverse citizenship, there being the requisite amount in controversy; and that the railway company attempted in the petition for removal to overcome the apparent obstacle arising from the joinder. Whether the petition was sufficient in that regard is the subject of opposing contentions.\n The right of removal from a state to a Federal court, as is well understood, exists only in certain enumerated classes of cases. To the exercise of the right, therefore, it is essential that the case be shown to be within one of those classes; and this must be done by a verified petition setting forth, agreeably to the ordinary rules of pleading, the particular facts, not already appearing, out of which the right arises. It is not enough to allege in terms that the case is removable or belongs to one of the enumerated classes, or otherwise to rest the right upon mere legal conclusions. As in other pleadings, there must be a statement of the facts relied upon, and not otherwise appearing, \n\n[232 U.S. 146, 152]\n\u00a0\n in order that the court may draw the proper conclusion from all the facts, and that, in the event of a removal, the opposing party may take issue, by a motion to remand, with what is alleged in the petition.

Rep. 264.\n A civil case, at law or in equity, presenting a controversy between citizens of different states, and involving the requisite jurisdictional amount, is one which may be removed by the defendant, if not a resident of the state in which the case is brought; and this right of removal cannot be defeated by a fraudulent joinder of a resident defendant having no real connection with the controversy. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Wangelin, \n132 \nU.S. 599, 601\n, 33 S. L. ed. 474, 475, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 203; Alabama G. S. R. Co. v. Thompson, \n200 \nU.S. 206, 218\n, 50 S. L. ed. 441, 447, 26 Sup. Ct.

So, when in such a case a resident defendant is joined with the nonresident, the joinder, even although fair upon its face, may be shown by a petition for removal to be only a fraudulent device to prevent a removal; but the showing must consist of a statement of facts rightly engendering that conclusion. Merely to traverse the allegations upon which the liability of the resident defendant is rested, or to apply the epithet 'fraudulent' to the joinder, will not suffice: the showing must be such as compels the conclusion that the joinder is without right and made in bad faith, as was the case in Wecker v. National Enameling & Stamping Co. \n204 U.S. 176\n, 51 L. ed. 430, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 184, 9 Ann. Cas. 757. See Illinois C. R. Co. v. Sheegog, \n215 \nU.S. 308, 316\n, 54 S. L. ed. 208, 211, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 101; Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Dowell, \n229 \nU.S. 102, 114\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1090, 1096, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 684.\n Here the plaintiff's petition, as is expressly conceded, not only stated a good cause of action against the resident defendants, but, tested by the laws of Kentucky, as it \n\n[232 U.S. 146, 153]\n\u00a0\n should be, stated a case of joint liability on the part of all the defendants. As thus stated the case was not removable, the joinder of the resident defendants being apparently the exercise of a lawful right. And while the plaintiff's statement was not conclusive upon the railway company, it did operate to lay upon the latter, as a condition to a removal, the duty of showing that the joinder of the engineer and fireman was merely a fraudulent device to prevent a removal. Of course, it was not such unless it was without any reasonable basis.\n Putting out of view, as must be done, the epithets and mere legal conclusions in the petition for removal, it may have disclosed an absence of good faith on the part of the plaintiff in bringing the action at all, but it did not show a fraudulent joinder of the engineer and fireman. With the allegation that they were operating the train which did the injury standing unchallenged, the showing amounted to nothing more than a traverse of the charges of negligence, with an added statement that they were falsely or recklessly made and could not be proved as to the engineer or fireman. As no negligent act or omission personal to the railway company was charged, and its liability, like that of the two employees, was, in effect, predicated upon the alleged negligence of the latter, the showing manifestly went to the merits of the action as an entirety, and not to the joinder; that is to say, it indicated that the plaintiff's case was ill founded as to all the defendants. Plainly, this was not such a showing as to engender or compel the conclusion that the two employees were wrongfully brought into a controversy which did not concern them. As they admittedly were in charge of the movement of the train, and their negligence was apparently the principal matter in dispute, the plaintiff had the same right, under the laws of Kentucky, to insist upon their presence as real defendants as upon that of the railway company. We conclude, therefore, that the petition for \n\n[232 U.S. 146, 154]\n\u00a0\n removal was not such as to require the state court to surrender its jurisdiction.\n While this conclusion requires an affirmance of the judgment, we would not be understood as approving the reasoning upon which the action of the trial court was sustained by the court of appeals of the state. That court, apparently assuming that the petition for removal contained a sufficient showing of a fraudulent joinder, held that the questions of fact arising upon the petition were open to examination and determination in the state court, and that no error was committed in refusing to surrender jurisdiction, because, upon the subsequent trial, the evidence indicated that the showing in the petition was not true as to the fireman. In so holding the court of appeals fell into manifest error, for it is thoroughly settled that issues of fact arising upon a petition for removal are to be determined in the Federal court, and that the state court, for the purpose of determining for itself whether it will surrender jurisdiction, must accept as true the allegations of fact in such petition. Stone v. South Carolina, \n117 \nU.S. 430, 432\n, 29 S. L. ed. 962, 963, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 799; Crehore v. Ohio & M. R. Co. \n131 \nU.S. 240, 244\n, 33 S. L. ed. 144, 145, 9 Sup. Ct.

L. ed. 1090, 1096, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 684. In this case had the petition contained a sufficient showing of a fraudulent joinder, accompanied as it was by a proper bond, the state court would have been in duty bound to give effect to the petition and surrender jurisdiction, leaving any issue of fact arising upon the petition to the decision of the Federal court, as was done in Wecker v. National Enameling & Stamping Co. \n204 U.S. 176\n, 51 L. ed. 430, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 184, 9 Ann. Cas. 757. And had the state court refused to give effect to the petition, it and the bond being sufficient, the railway company might have obtained a certified transcript of the record, resorting, if necessary, to a writ of certiorari for that purpose, and, upon filing the transcript in the Federal court, might have invoked the authority of the latter to protect its jurisdiction by enjoining the plaintiff from tak- \n\n[232 U.S. 146, 155]\n\u00a0\n ing further proceedings in the state court, unless the cause should be remanded.

A statute of South Dakota, after making the railroad company absolutely responsible in such cases, goes on to make it liable for double the amount of damage actually sustained unless it pays the full amount within sixty days from notice. If, within sixty days, it shall 'ofter in writing to pay a fixed sum, being the full amount of the damages sustained, and the owner shall refuse to accept the same, then in any action thereafter brought for such damages, when such owner recovers a less sum as damages than the amount so offered, then such owner shall recover only his damages, and the railway company shall recover its costs.' S. D. Laws 1907, chap. 215. The plaintiff got a verdict for $780. The railroad had offered $500; less, that is, than the amount of the verdict, while the plaintiff, on the other hand, demanded more. In his demand, his declaration, and his testimony, he set the damage at $838.20. A judgment for double damages was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 26 S. D. 378, 128 N. W. 472.\n The defendant in error presented no argument, probably because he realized that under the recent decisions \n\n[232 U.S. 165, 168]\n\u00a0\n of this court the judgment could not be sustained. No doubt the states have a large latitude in the policy that they will pursue and enforce, but the rudiments of fair play required by the 14th Amendment are wanting when a defendant is required to guess rightly what a jury will find, or pay double if that body sees fit to add 1 cent to the amount that was tendered, although the tender was obviously futile because of an excessive demand.

The defendant answered, denying the validity of \n\n[233 U.S. 334, 340]\n\u00a0\n the order, and also filed a cross petition to set it aside, alleging that it was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, as an attempt to regulate interstate commerce and to deprive the company of its property without due process of law, and, further, that the Commission was without authority under the laws of the state to make the order. Judgment, sustaining the action of the Commission and directing compliance, was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 152 Iowa, 317, 130 N. W. 802.\n It appeared that the railway company, in 1909, had refused to accept shipments of coal in carload lots at Davenport, Iowa, for points in that state when tendered in cars of other railroad companies by which the coal had been brought to Davenport from points in Illinois. The railway company insisted that it was entitled to furnish its own cars. The Clark Coal & Coke Company, operating a branch at Davenport, complained of this rule to the Railroad Commission, stating that it was a departure from the practice which had obtained for several years with respect to such shipments, that the Clark Company paid all charges to Davenport, and on receiving orders from its customers tendered written billing for transportation from Davenport to the designated points, and that it was unreasonable for the railway company to require in such cases that the coal should be unloaded and reloaded in its own cars. A hearing was had before the Commission at which other shippers intervened, adopting the coal company's complaint. The facts were presented in an agreed statement, as follows:\n'The Clark Coal & Coke Company of Davenport, Iowa, have been making shipments of coal from points in Illinois to Davenport by the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company and the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railroad Company; that said coal is then placed by the railroad bringing it into Iowa on an interchange track at Davenport; that all charges from point of origin \n\n[233 U.S. 334, 341]\n\u00a0\n in Illinois to Davenport, Iowa, are paid by the Clark Coal & Coke Company to the railroad company bringing said coal; that thereupon complainant has notified the respondent railway company of the placement of said coal, and that it desired to ship said coal by the respondent railway company to different points on its own line, and tendered a written billing from Davenport to the point so designated; that thereupon respondent railway company has accepted said billing from Davenport to said point, and taken said cars from said interchange track to its own line, and transported the same in accordance with said written billing; that the respondent railway company has changed its method of doing business in the above respects by its printed order, and now refuses to accept said written billing and take said cars from said interchange track and transport them over its own line to the point designated by said billing, unless said coal is loaded in equipment belonging to respondent railway company. Respondent railway company, by its answer to the complaint, alleges that it 'will furnish cars for shipment of coal from Davenport to any point in Iowa, as provided by Iowa Distance Tariff, but will not accept shipments originating at Davenport, billed from Davenport, in the equipment of other carriers,' and its readiness and ability to furnish cars of its own for shipment is not controverted and will therefore be taken to be true. It will thus be observed that before the respondent railway company will take coal for transportation on its own line, in equipment other than its own, it requires that the same shall be unloaded and reloaded into its own cars.'\n\n Thereupon, the Commission rendered a decision in favor of the shipper and entered the following order, to which this controversy relates:\n'In accordance with the conclusions heretofore expressed, it is therefore ordered by the Board of Railroad Commissioners of Iowa that upon arrival of loaded cars of \n\n[233 U.S. 334, 342]\n\u00a0\n coal at the city of Davenport, upon any line of railroad, when said cars are placed upon the interchange track at Davenport, as ordered or requested by the owner or consignee of said cars, and the freight paid thereon, and the ordinary billing in use by the respondent railway is tendered to it for a billing of said cars so placed to a point on its own line within the state of Iowa, that the respondent railway company be and is hereby ordered and required to accept said billing, receive said car or cars so billed, and transport them on its own line to the point designated by the owner or consignee in said billing; and that it receive said car or cars in whatever equipment the same may be loaded, without requiring an unloading and reloading into its own equipment, and transport said car or cars over its own line to points within this so loaded, without unloading and reloading as above set forth, in the same manner that it receives cars from connecting lines, loaded in its own equipment. It is expressly understood, however, in this order, that no questions in relation to switching charges are determined.'\n\n The railway company contended, both before the Commission and in the state court, that the shipments in question were interstate; and it was alleged in its answer that the method of transportation resorted to was a device of shippers to secure, by adding the rate from the initial point in Illinois to Davenport to the rate established by the Iowa distance tariff from Davenport to other points in the state, a lower rate than that applicable to an interstate shipment from the point in Illinois to the point of final destination.\n The Railroad Commission held that the transportation desired from Davenport was a purely intrastate service, saying: 'Under the admitted facts, the city of Davenport became a distributing point for coal shipped by the consignor. The certainty in regard to the shipments of coal ended at Davenport. The point where the same was to be \n\n[233 U.S. 334, 343]\n\u00a0\n shipped beyond Davenport, if at all, was determined after the arrival of the coal at Davenport. The coal was under the control of the consignee, and he could sell it in transit or at Davenport, or reconsign it to a point on respondent's railway, or any other railway, at his own discretion.' Upon the trial of the present suit in the state court, the state introduced in evidence the proceedings, decision, and order of the Commission, and without further evidence both parties rested. The supreme court of the state took the same view of the facts that the Commission had taken, and accordingly held that the shipments were intrastate. The court said that the facts showed that the coal was originally consigned to the coal company in Davenport, that it was there held until sales were made, that the consignee had taken delivery, paying the freight to the initial carrier, and assuming full control. 152 Iowa, 317, 319, 130, N. W. 802.\n The record discloses no ground for assailing this finding. It is undoubtedly true that the question whether commerce is interstate or intrastate must be determined by the essential character of the commerce, and not by mere billing or forms of contract. Railroad Commission v. Worthington, \n225 U.S. 101\n, 56 L. ed. 1004, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 653; Texas & N. O. R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co. \n227 U.S. 111\n, 57 L. ed. 442, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229; Railroad Commission v. Texas & P. R. Co. \n229 U.S. 336\n, 57 L. ed. 1215, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 837. But the fact that commodities received on interstate shipments are reshipped by the consignees, in the cars in which they are received, to other points of destination, does not necessarily establish a continuity of movement, or prevent the reshipment to a point within the same state from having an independent and intrastate character. Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Texas, \n204 U.S. 403\n, 51 L. ed. 540, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 360; Railroad Commission v. Worthington, \n225 \nU.S. 101, 109\n, 56 S. L. ed. 1004, 1008, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 653; Texas & N. O. R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co. \n227 \nU.S. 111, 129\n, 130 S., 57 L. ed. 442, 449, 450, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229. The question is with respect to the nature of the actual movement in the particular \n\n[233 U.S. 334, 344]\n\u00a0\n case; and we are unable to say upon this record that the state court has improperly characterized the traffic in question here. In the light of its decision, the order of the Commission must be taken as referring solely to intrastate transportation originating at Davenport.\n In this view, the validity of the Commission's order is challenged upon the ground that at common law the carrier was entitled to use its own equipment, and that the statute of the state of Iowa as to the receiving of cars from connecting carriers (Code,  2116) is inapplicable for the reason that, with respect to the transportation in question, the plaintiff in error was the initial carrier. But the obvious answer is that what is required by the law of Iowa has been determined by the supreme court of that state. That court, examining the various provisions of the Iowa Code which have relation to the matter, has held that the order was within the aughority of the Railroad Commission. 152 Iowa, 317, 320, 321, 130 N. W. 802.\n Further, the plaintiff in error insists that the enforcement of the order would deprive it of its liberty to contract, and of its property, without due process of law, and would deny to it the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the 14th Amendment. We find these objections to be without merit. It was competent for the state, acting within its jurisdiction, and not in hostility to any Federal regulation of interstate commerce, to compel the carrier to accept cars which were already loaded and in suitable condition for transportation over its line. The requirement was a reasonable one. It cannot be said that the plaintiff in error had a constitutional right to burden trade by insisting that the commodities should be unloaded and reloaded in its own equipment. Upon this point the case of Wisconsin, M. & P. R. Co. v. Jacobson, \n179 U.S. 287\n, 45 L. ed. 194, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 115, is decisive. There is no essential difference, so far as the power of the state is concerned, between such an order as we have here and one compelling the \n\n[233 U.S. 334, 345]\n\u00a0\n carrier to make track connections, and to receive cars from connecting roads, in order that reasonably adequate facilities for traffic may be provided. See also Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n186 \nU.S. 257, 263\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1151, 1156, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 900; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. North Carolina Corp.

Rep. 152.\n It is argued that it was unreasonable to subject the railway company to the expense incident to the use of the cars of another carrier when it was ready to furnish its own. The record affords no sufficient basis for this contention. What the expense referred to would be was not proved, and, in the absence of a suitable disclosure of the pertinent facts, no case was made which would justify the conslusion that, in its practical operation, the regulation would impose any unreasonable burden. On the other hand, the agreed statement makes it evident that prior to the change which gave rise to this controversy it was the practice of the company to accept such shipments.\n Finally, it is said that the order of the Commission interferes with interstate commerce because the cars in question were the vehicles of that commerce, and were brought into the state as such. No question, however, is presented here as between the shippers and the owners of the cars, and no actual interference with interstate commerce is shown. Nor does it appear that any regulation under Federal authority has been violated.\n The plaintiff in error has failed to establish any ground for invalidating the order of the Commission and the judgment must be affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","38":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO, M. & ST.

The statement, in substance, shows:\n Within the limits of the city of Minneapolis are Lake Calhoun, Lake of the Isles, and Cedar lake, lying in close proximity to each other, and used by the public for pleasure boating and other recreations. The city, having acquired for park and parkway purposes the shores of Lake Calhoun and Lake of the Isles, and a portion of the shores of Cedar lake, together with large tracts of land in the vicinity, is engaged in constructing two canals which will connect the lakes and will greatly enhance their usefulness to the public. Between Lake Calhoun and Lake of the Isles is a strip of land, 600 feet wide in its narrowest part, through which one of these canals is to be opened. Along this strip and near its center lies the right of way-100 feet in width-of the appellant, the Chicago, Milwaukee, & St. Paul Railway Company, which is used by it in the operation of its road. The city, in order to provide for the canal and walks on either side, seeks to condemn an easement in a piece of land 100 feet wide across the right of way. The two lakes are now connected by a small water course which crosses the right of way about 59 feet from the center of the proposed canal, and is carried under the railway tracks by a pipe about 3 feet in diameter. The construction of the canal will render the water course and pipe useless and permit the closing of this channel. At the point where the land is to be taken by the city, the railway tracks are upon an artificial embankment about 18 feet above the established level of the \n\n[232 U.S. 430, 437]\n\u00a0\n water in the lakes. The city's improvement will require the construction of a bridge to carry the tracks across the canal and walks. The agreed value of the mere land proposed to be taken, irrespective of the cost of the bridge, is the sum of $10; and the estimated cost of building a bridge in accordance with plans prepared by the city and accepted by the railway company is the sum of $18,513. It is agreed that an adequate bridge for railway purposes, built according to the plans usually adopted by the railway company, would cost only $15,969. The difference in cost, or $2, 544, is due to ornamental features, and this amount it is agreed that, in any event, the city shall pay. For the purposes of this proceeding, the railway company conceded the authority of the city to take the described land under the power of eminent domain; and it was agreed accordingly that the city should take the land and construct the canal and walks, and that the railway company should build the bridge after the city's plans; but no claim for damages or compensation to which the railway company was entitled under the law by reason of the taking was waived.\n The controversy submitted was as to the amount which the company should receive. It was contended by the company that it should be paid (1) the sum of $10 as the agreed value of the land taken, (2) the entire cost of the bridge, and (3) such further sum as would be sufficient to maintain the bridge. It was also insisted that to divest it of its property without such payment would be a violation both of the state Constitution and of  1 of the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution. In the court of first instance it was held that the company was entitled to recover only the sum of $2,554, being the value of the land and the cost of the ornamental features of the bridge; and this judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 115 Minn. 460, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) --, 133 N.

Goldsboro, decided this day [\n232 U.S. 548\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 364]. The rule, as established in the state of Minnesota, was thus declared in the case of State ex rel. Minneapolis v. St. Paul, M. & M. R. Co. 98 Minn. 380, 28 L.R.A.(N.S.) 298, 120 Am. St. Rep. 581, 108 N. W. 261, 8 Ann. Cas. 1047 (see 115 Minn. p. 466): 'A railroad company receives its charter and franchise subject to the implied right of the state to establish and open such streets and highways over and across its right of way as public convenience and necessity may, from time to time, require. That right on the part of the state attaches by implication of law to the franchise of the railroad company, and imposes upon it an obligation to construct and maintain at its own expense suitable crossings at new streets and highways to the same extent as required by the rules of the common law at streets and highways in existence when the railroad was constructed.' In that case, it appeared that long after the construction of the railroad, the city of Minneapolis had laid \n\n[232 U.S. 430, 439]\n\u00a0\n out a street across the railroad right of way, building at its own cost a bridge over the railroad tracks. After the bridge had been maintained for several years by the city it was destroyed by fire, and the city then demanded that the railroad company should build a new one. This demand the state court sustained; and, mandamus having thereupon been awarded (101 Minn. 545, 112 N. W. 1142), the case was brought to this court, one of the grounds being that the action of the state deprived the company of its property without due process of law. The judgment was affirmed (St. Paul, M. & M. R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n214 U.S. 497\n, 53 L. ed. 1060, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 698), this conclusion being reached upon the authority of Northern P. R. Co. v. Duluth, \n208 U.S. 583\n, 52 L. ed. 630, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 341. Although the Duluth Case was earlier in this court, the decision therein by the supreme court of the state immediately followed that of the same court in the Minneapolis Case, and applied the principle which had been there announced. State ex rel. Duluth v. Northern P. R. Co. 98 Minn. 429, 108 N. W. 269. The facts were that after the railroad had been built, a street had been opened across the right of way, and subsequently a viaduct for the crossing had been constructed at the joint expense of the city and the railroad company, the former agreeing to maintain it. Later, the city, repudiating the agreement, insisted that the company should repair the viaduct at its own expense. The state court entered judgment for the city, holding that the obligation to construct and maintain the viaduct rested upon the railroad company, and that hence the contract was invalid. This court affirmed the judgment, saying: 'As the supreme court of Minnesota points out in the opinion in 98 Minn. 380, . . . the state courts are not altogether agreed as to the right to compel railroads, without compensation, to construct and maintain suitable crossings at streets extended over its right of way, after the construction of the railroad. The great weight of state au- \n\n[232 U.S. 430, 440]\n\u00a0\n thority is in favor of such right. See cases cited in 98 Minn. 380. There can be no question as to the attitude of this court upon this question, as it has been uniformly held that the right to exercise the police power is a continuing one; that it cannot be contracted away, and that a requirement that a company or individual comply with reasonable police regulations without compensation is the legitimate exercise of the power, and not in violation of the constitutional inhibition against the impairment of the obligation of contracts. . . . In this case the supreme court of Minnesota has held that the charter of the company, as well as the common law, required the railroad, as to existing and future streets, to maintain them in safety, and to hold its charter rights subject to the exercise of the legislative power in this behalf, and that any contract which undertook to limit the exercise of this right was without consideration, against public policy, and void. This doctrine is entirely consistent with the principles decided in the cases referred to in this court.'\n In Cincinnati, I. & W. R. Co. v. Connersville, \n218 \nU.S. 336, 343\n, 344 S., 54 L. ed. 1060, 1064, 1065, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 93, 20 Ann. Cas. 1206, a street was opened through an embankment upon which the railroad tracks were laid. At the time of the construction of the railroad that part of the embankment was outside the city limits. But the city was extended, and the intersecting street was laid out in order to provide a suitable means of communication between the parts of the city on either side of the embankment. On reviewing the judgment entered in the condemnation proceeding, it was held that there was no violation of the 14th Amendment in refusing to allow to the company the cost of building a bridge for its tracks over the opening made by the street. 'The question,' said the court, 'as to the right of the railway company to be reimbursed for any moneys necessarily expended in constructing the bridge in question is, we think, concluded \n\n[232 U.S. 430, 441]\n\u00a0\n by former decisions of this court. . . . The railway company accepted its franchise from the state, subject necessarily to the condition that it would conform at its own expense to any regulations, not arbitrary in their character, as to the opening or use of streets, which had for their object the safety of the public, or the promotion of the public convenience, and which might, from time to time, be established by the municipality, when proceeding under legislative authority, within whose limits the company's business was conducted. . . . Without further discussion, . . . we adjudge, upon the authority of former cases, that there was no error in holding that the city could not be compelled to reimburse the railway company for the cost of the bridge in question.'\n Under the doctrine of these decisions, it necessarily follows that if the city of Minneapolis had opened a public road through the embankment of the plaintiff in error, the latter would have had no ground to complain that its constitutional rights had been violated because it was compelled to bridge the gap at its own cost. No different rule could be applied because the highway was laid out in order to increase the advantages of a public park. In this aspect, it would be equally a crossing devoted to the public use (Shoemaker v. United States, \n147 \nU.S. 282, 297\n, 37 S. L. ed. 170, 184, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 361); and we see no basis for a distinction in principle in the case of an intersecting public road opened under competent authority because such a highway might lead to public recreation grounds instead of to places of business, or might connect lakes instead of avenues.\n If there is a distinction in the present case, it must lie in the fact that the crossing is an artificial waterway instead of a road. But it is none the less a public highway, established to afford an appropriate place of public passage. Walks are provided for those who go afoot, and it does not concern the plaintiff in error that others go in \n\n[232 U.S. 430, 442]\n\u00a0\n boats instead of vehicles. 'The way sought to be established,' said the supreme court of Minnesota, 'a canal or waterway, with walks along each side,' was 'clearly a public way, subject to the rules governing public ways.' It cannot make a difference in the constitutional rights of the railway company that this way was not constructed entirely, or chiefly, of solid earth; it is the fact, and not the mode, of public passage, that is controlling. The case must be regarded as being one of a public crossing provided by law; and the authorities we have cited lead to the conclusion that the state, without infringing the guaranties of the Federal Constitution, could require the railway company to make suitable provision for carrying its tracks over the crossing without compensation.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO, R.

Dillard for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 490, 492]\n\u00a0\n No appearance for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff, Cramer, sued the railroad company to recover $992, the amount of damage to a carload of 60 hogs shipped from Galt, Iowa, to Chicago, Illinois. The company defended on the ground that the plaintiff overloaded the car, and placed therein such an excessive quantity of hay as to overheat the animals, thereby damaging some and causing the death of others. It further contended that no agent of the company had any knowledge as to the value of the hogs, except what was stated by the shipper, who represented that their value did not exceed $10 per head, and thereby secured the benefit of the lower of two rates specified in the tariff on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission and at Galt. One of these rates applied where the value of the hogs did not exceed $10 per head, and the other, a higher rate, applied where the value exceeded $10 per head. The defendant claimed that the tariffs were binding on plain- \n\n[232 U.S. 490, 493]\n\u00a0\n tiff, and that he could not, in any event, recover beyond the valuation on which the freight was charged. This latter defense was stricken out on demurrer, and the trial resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for more than $600. On writ of error the supreme court affirmed the judgment and sustained the order, striking out the plea on the ground that such defense was prohibited by  2074 of the Iowa Code, which provides that:\n'No contract, receipt, rule, or regulation shall exempt any railway corporation engaged in transporting persons or property, from the liability of a common carrier or carrier of passengers, which would exist had no contract, receipt, rule, or regulation been made or entered into.'\n\n In Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Solan, \n169 U.S. 133\n, 42 L. ed. 688, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 289, decided in January, 1898, it was held that this statute was valid even as applied to interstate shipments. But in 1906 Congress passed the Hepburn bill [34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1288], which established in interstate commerce a uniform rule of liability. That rule of liability is to be enforced in the light of the fact that the provisions of the tariff enter into and form a part of the contract of shipment, and if a regularly filed tariff offers two rates, based on value, and the goods are forwarded at the low value in order to secure the low rate, then the carrier may avail itself of that valuation when sued for loss or damage to the property. The question has been so fully considered in cases determined since the decision herein of the supreme court of Iowa, that it is unnecessary to do more than refer to Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, \n227 U.S. 645\n, 57 L. ed. 685, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 391; Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Harriman, \n227 U.S. 657\n, 57 L. ed. 690, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397, where the facts were substantially like those here involved, and where it was held that a carrier had the right to make a defense like that filed in the court below.

The claim was based on the Oklahoma statute which provides for a gross revenue tax; and was resisted upon the ground (among others) that in reality the demand was for an occupation or privilege tax to which the appellant could not lawfully be subjected, because, as a Federal instrumentality acting under Con- \n\n[235 U.S. 292, 296]\n\u00a0\n gressional authority, it had leased and was operating mines to which the Indians held title. A general demurrer was sustained, and the cause is here by direct appeal.\n No objection has been interposed to the forum selected or the procedure adopted. Meyer v.

In the region formerly known as Indian Territory,-now within the state of Oklahoma,-the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians, as wards of the United States, own a large area of segregated and unallotted lands containing valuable coal deposits which are not subject to taxation by the state.

Rep. 769.\n The act of Congress approved June 28, 1898 (30 Stat. at L. 495, 510, chap. 517), 'Curtis act,' ratified, confirmed, and put into effect the Atoka agreement of April 23, 1897, between the United States and the Choctaws and Chickasaws, which provided that their coal lands should remain common property of the members of the tribes; that the revenues derived therefrom should be used for the education of their children; that the mines thereon should be under the supervision and control of two trustees appointed by the President, and subject to rules prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior; that all such mines should be operated and the royalties paid into the Treasury of the United States; that the royalty should be 15 cents per ton, with power in the Secretary of the Interior to reduce or advance the same according to the best interests of the tribes; and that all lessees should pay fixed sums as advanced royalties.\n In harmony with the provisions of the Curtis act appellant secured from the duly appointed trustees leases of certain mines, obligating itself to take out annually \n\n[235 U.S. 292, 297]\n\u00a0\n specified amounts of coal, and to pay the stipulated royalty. It proceeded actively to develop these, either directly or through its agent, and for some years before the present suit was begun took therefrom large qnantities of coal, and fully complied with the obligations assumed.\n Section 6 of the Oklahoma statute approved May 26, 1908, entitled, 'An Act Providing for the Levy and Collection of a Gross Revenue Tax from . . . Persons, Firms, Corporations, or Associations Engaged in the Mining or Production of Coal, . . .' provides: 'Every person, firm, association, or corporation engaged in the mining, or production, within this state, of coal . . . shall, within thirty days after the expiration of each quarter annual period expiring respectively on the 1st day of July, October, January, and April of each year, file with the state auditor a statement under oath, on forms prescribed by him, showing the location of each mine . . . operated by such person, firm, association, or corporation during the last preceding quarter annual period, the kind of mineral; . . . the gross amount thereof produced; the actual cash value thereof; . . . and shall, at the same time, pay to the state treasurer a gross revenue tax, which shall be in addition to the taxes levied and collected upon an ad valorem basis upon such mining . . . property and the appurtenances thereunto belonging, equal to 2 per centum of the gross receipts from the total production of coal therefrom . . .' An amendment of March 27, 1909, changed the quarterly periods and reduced the rate on receipts to 1\/2 & 1 per centum.\n Appellants furnished the auditor with a statement of the output of the mines operated, but declined to pay the tax assessed upon the gross receipts from sales. Thereupon the sheriff, under directions of the auditor, was \n\n[235 U.S. 292, 298]\n\u00a0\n about to enforce the demand by a levy, and the present bill was filed to restrain him.\n From the foregoing it seems manifest that the agreement with the Indians imposed upon the United States a definite duty in respect to opening and operating the coal mines upon their lands, and appellant is the instrumentality through which this obligation is being carried into effect. Such an agency cannot be subjected to an occupation or privilege tax by a state. M'Cullock v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 425, 4 L. ed. 579, 606; Farmers & M. Sav. Bank v. Minnesota, \n232 U.S. 516\n, 58 L. ed. 706, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 354. But it is insisted that the statute, rightly understood, prescribed only an ad valorem imposition on the personal property owned by appellant,-the coal at the pit's mouth,-which is permissible, according to many opinions of this court. Thomson v. Union P. R. Co. 9 Wall. 579, 19 L. ed. 792; Union P. R. Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 21 L. ed. 787; Central P. R. Co. v. California, \n162 U.S. 91\n, 40 L. ed. 903, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 766; Thomas v. Gay, \n169 U.S. 264\n, 42 L. ed. 740, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 340.\n The court below held that the effect of the act was to lay a valid tax on personalty, and the same result was subsequently reached by the supreme court of Oklahoma. McAlester-Edwards Coal Co. v. Trapp, 43 Okla. 510, 141 Pac. 794. The United States district court for the western district of Oklahoma arrived at a different conclusion. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Meyer, 204 Fed. 140.\n Neither state courts nor legislatures, by giving a tax a particular name, or by the use of some form of words, can take away our duty to consider its real nature and effect. Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 227\n, 52 S. L. ed. 1031, 1037, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638.\n It is unnecessary to consider the power of the state of Oklahoma to treat coals dug from mines operated by the appellant as other personalty, and to subject them to a uniform ad valorem tax, for it seems to us clear that the act of 1908 provided for no such imposition. Its very \n\n[235 U.S. 292, 299]\n\u00a0\n language imposes a 'gross revenue tax which shall be in addition to the taxes levied and collected upon an ad valorem basis.' We cannot, therefore, conclude that the gross receipts were intended merely to represent the measure of the value of property liable to a general assessment-provision is made for determining that upon a different basis. Meyer v. Wells, F. & Co. \n223 \nU.S. 298, 301\n, 56 S. L. ed. 445, 447, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 218. The requirement is not on account of property owned on a given day, as is the general custom where ad valorem taxes are provided for, and as the Oklahoma laws require; but the manifest purpose is to reach all sales and secure a certain percentage thereof,-a method commonly pursued in respect of license and occupation taxes.

Brewer for Ravenna National Bank.\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 360, 363]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n Upon a petition filed in the district court for the northern district of Ohio by one of her creditors, Cora M. Curtis was adjudged a bankrupt. In addition to matters not requiring notice, the petition charged that within four months next preceding its filing the respondent committed an act of bankruptcy, in that (a), while insolvent, she suffered and permitted the Citizens Banking Company to recover a judgment against her for $1,598.78 and costs, in the common pleas court of Erie county, Ohio, and to have an execution issued under the judgment and levied on real estate belonging to her, whereby the company obtained a preference over her other creditors, and (b) at the time of the filing of the petition which was one day less than four months after the levy of the execution, she had not vacated or discharged the levy and resulting preference.\n The company appeared in the bankruptcy proceedings and challenged the petition on the ground that it disclosed no act of bankruptcy, but the court, deeming that such an act was charged, overruled the objection, and, there being no denial of the facts stated in the petition, adjudged the respondent a bankrupt. The company appealed to the circuit court of appeals, and that court, having briefly reviewed the opposing views touching the point in controversy (121 C. C. A. 250, 202 Fed. 892), certified the case here, with a request that instruction be given on the following questions:\n'(1) Whether the failure by an insolvent judgment \n\n[234 U.S. 360, 364]\n\u00a0\n debtor, and for a period of one day less than four months after the levy of an execution upon his real estate, to vacate or discharge such levy, is a 'final disposition of the property' affected by the levy, under the provisions of  3a (3) of the bankruptcy act of 1898 [30 Stat. at L. 546, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3422].\n\n'(2) Whether an insolvent debtor commits an act of bankruptcy, rendering him subject to involuntary adjudication as a bankrupt under the bankruptcy act of 1898, merely by inaction for the period of four months after the levy of an execution upon his real estate.'\n\n It will be observed that no reference is made to an accomplished or impending disposal of the property in virtue of the levy, although the mode of disposal prescribed by the local law is by advertisement and sale. 2 Bates's Anno. Stat. (Ohio)  5381, 5393\n\n\n The answers to the questions propounded turn upon the true construction of  3a(3) of the bankruptcy act, which declares:\n'Acts of bankruptcy by a person shall consist of his having . . . (3) suffered or permitted, while insolvent, any creditor to obtain a preference through legal proceedings, and not having at least five days before a sale or final disposition of any property affected by such preference vacated or discharged such preference.' 30 Stat. at L. 544, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3418.\n\n Looking at the terms of this provision, it is manifest that the act of bankruptcy which it defines consists of three elements. The first is the insolvency of the debtor; the second is suffering or permitting a creditor to obtain a preference through legal proceedings; that is, to acquire a lien upon property of the debtor by means of a judgment, attachment, execution, or kindred proceeding, the enforcement of which will enable the creditor to collect a greater percentage of his claim than other creditors of the same class; and the third is the failure of the debtor to vacate or discharge the lien and resulting preference five days \n\n[234 U.S. 360, 365]\n\u00a0\n before a sale or final disposition of any property affected. Only through the combination of the three elements is the act of bankruptcy committed. Insolvency alone does not suffice, nor is it enough that it be coupled with suffering or permitting a creditor to obtain a preference by legal proceedings. The third element must also be present, else there is no act of bankruptcy within the meaning of this provision. All this is freely conceded by counsel for the petitioning creditor.\n The questions propounded assume the existence of the first two elements, and are intended to elicit instruction respecting the proper interpretation of the clause describing the third; namely, 'and not having, at least five days before a sale or final disposition of any property affected by such preference, vacated or discharged such preference.' It is to this point that counsel have addressed their arguments.\n Without any doubt this clause shows that the debtor is to have until five days before an approaching or impending event within which to vacate or discharge the lien out of which the preference arises. What, then, is the event which he is required to anticipate? The statute answers, 'a sale or final disposition of any property affected by such preference.' As these words are part of a provision dealing with liens obtained through legal proceedings, and as the enforcement of such a lien usually consists in selling some or all of the property affected, and applying the proceeds to the creditor's demand, it seems quite plain that it is to such a sale that the clause refers. And as there are instances in which the property affected does not require to be sold, as when it is money seized upon execution or attachment, or reached by garnishment, it seems equally\n See Turner v. Fendall, 1 Cranch, 117, 133, 2 L. ed. 53, 59; Sheldon v. Root, 16 Pick. 567, 28 Am. Dec. 266; Crane v. Freese, 16 N. J. L. 305; Green v. Palmer, 15 Cal. 411, 418, 76 Am. Dec. 492; 2 Bates's Anno. Stat. ( Ohio)  5374, 5383, 5469, 5470, 5483, 5531, 5548, 5555. \n\n[234 U.S. 360, 366]\n\u00a0\n plain that the words 'or final disposition' are intended to include the act whereby the debtor's title is passed to another when a sale is not required. No doubt, the terms 'sale or final disposition,' explained as they are by the context, are comprehensive of every act of disposal, whether by sale or otherwise, which operates as an enforcement of the lien or preference.\n But we do not perceive anything in the clause which suggests that the time when the lien is obtained has any bearing upon when the property must be freed from it to avoid an act of bankruptcy. On the contrary, the natural and plain import of the language employed is that it will suffice if the lien is lifted five days before a sale or final disposition of any of the property affected. This is the only point of time that is mentioned, and the implication is that it is intended to be controlling.\n To enforce a different conclusion counsel for the petitioning creditor virtually contends that the clause has the same meaning as if it read, 'and having failed to vacate or discharge the preference at least five days before a sale or final disposition of any of the property affected, or, at most, not later than five days before the expiration of four months after the lien was obtained.' But we think such a meaning cannot be ascribed to it without rewriting it, and that we cannot do. The contention puts into it an alternative which is not there, either in terms or by fair implication, and to which Congress has not given assent. Indeed, it appears that in the early stages of its enactment the bankruptcy bill contained a provision giving the same effect to a failure to discharge the lien within a prescribed period after it attached as to a failure to discharge it within a designated number of days before an intended sale; and that during the final consideration of the bill that provision was eliminated and the one now before us was adopted. This, of course, lends strength to the implication otherwise arising that the clause names the sole test of \n\n[234 U.S. 360, 367]\n\u00a0\n when the lien must be vacated or discharged to avoid an act of bankruptcy.\n The contention to the contrary is sought to be sustained by a reference to  3b, 67c, and 67f. But we perceive nothing in those sections to disturb the plain meaning of  3a(3). It defines a particular act of bankruptcy, and purports to be complete in itself, as do other subsections defining other acts of bankruptcy. Section 3b deals with the time for filing petitions in bankruptcy and limits it to four months after the act of bankruptcy is committed. It says nothing about what constitutes an act of bankruptcy, but treats that as elsewhere adequately defined. Sections 67c and 67f deal with the retrospective effect of adjudications in bankruptcy, the former declaring that certain liens obtained in suits begun within four months before the filing of the petition shall be dissolved by the adjudication, and the latter that certain levies, judgments, attachments, and other liens obtained through legal proceedings within the same period shall become null and void upon the adjudication. Both assume that the adjudication will be grounded upon a sufficient act of bankruptcy, as elsewhere defined, and give to every adjudication the same effect upon the liens described, whether it be grounded upon one act of bankruptcy or another. And what is more in point, there is no conflict between  3a(3) and the sections indicated. All can be given full effect according to their natural import without any semblance of interference between  3a(3) and the others.\n But it is said that unless  3a(3) be held to require the extinguishment of the lien before the expiration of four months from the time it was obtained the result will be that in some instances the lien will not be dissolved or rendered null through the operation of  67c and 67f, because occasionally the full four months will intervene before an act of bankruptcy is committed, and therefore before a petition can be filed. Conceding that this is so, \n\n[234 U.S. 360, 368]\n\u00a0\n it proves nothing more than what is true of all liens obtained through legal proceedings more than four months prior to the filing of the petition. And while it may be true, as is suggested, that if the debtor is not restricted to less than four months within which to extinguish the lien there will be instances in which general creditors will be affected disadvantageously, it must be reflected that there also will be instances in which an honest and struggling debtor will be able to extinguish the lien the requisite number of days before a sale or final disposition of any of the property affected, and thereby to avoid bankruptcy, without injury to any of his creditors. But with this we are not concerned. The advantages and disadvantages have been balanced by Congress, and its will has been expressed in terms which are plain and therefore controlling.\n Lastly, it is said that the term 'final disposition' is not used in the sense hereinbefore indicated, but as denoting the status which a lien acquires through the lapse of four months before the filing of a petition in bankruptcy. This is practically a reiteration of the contention already noticed, but probably is intended to present if from a different angle. It overlooks, as we think, the influsence which rightly must be given to the context, and also the manifest inaptness of the term to express the thought suggested. When one speaks of a sale or final disposition of property, he means by final disposition an act having substantially the effect of a sale,-a transfer of ownership and control from one to another,- and especially is this true when he is referring to a sale or final disposition in the enforcement of a lien. We regard it as entirely clear that the term is so used in this instance, and that it signifies an affirmative act of disposal, not a mere lapse of time which leaves the lien intact and still requiring enforcement. To illustrate, let us take the instance of a provisional attachment of real property, which the creditor is not entitled to enforce unless he sustains the demand which is the sub- \n\n[234 U.S. 360, 369]\n\u00a0\n ject of the principal suit; and let us suppose that the debtor defends against the demand, and that the suit is pending and undetermined four months after the levy. Of course, an adjudication in bankruptcy upon a petition filed thereafter would not disturb the attachment. But could it be said that the property attached was finally disposed of at the end of the four months? An affirmative answer seems quite inadmissible.\n We conclude that both of the questions propounded by the circuit court of appeals should be resolved in the negative.\n As shown by the reported cases, some diversity of opinion has arisen in other Federal courts in disposing of similar questions (Re Rome Planing Mill, 96 Fed. 812, 815; Re Vastbinder, 126 Fed. 417, 420; Re Tupper, 163 Fed. 766, 770; Re Windt, 177 Fed. 584, 586; Re Crafts-Riordon Shoe Co. 185 Fed. 931, 934; Folger v. Putnam, 114 C. C. A. 513, 194 Fed. 793, 797; Re Truitt, 203 Fed. 550, 554), and so we deem it well to observe that the conclusion here stated has been reached only after full consideration of those cases.\n Questions answered 'No.' \n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF LOUISVILLE v.

Boynton, and James Turner for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit was brought by the International Transit Company, a Canadian corporation, to restrain the enforce- \n\n[234 U.S. 333, 338]\n\u00a0\n ment of an ordinance adopted, in the year 1911, by the city of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The ordinance related to the maintaining of ferries from that city across the St. Mary's river to the opposite shore, in the province of Ontario; and the complainant contended that, as applied to it, the ordinance was a violation of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution and of article 1 of the treaty of January 11, 1909 (36 Stat. at L. 2449), between the United States and Great Britain. The district court granted the relief as prayed (194 Fed. 522); and this appeal is brought.\n The transit company holds a license from the Dominion government to operate a ferry between Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. It owns, and uses in this business, two steam ferryboats of British registry; it leases a private wharf in the city of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and there maintains an office where fares are received. The Canadian license prescribes the frequency of the service and fixes the maximum fares to be charged; it also provides that the licensee shall not 'infringe any of the laws or bylaws or of the regulations' of the United States or of the state of Michigan or 'of the town of Sault Ste. Marie, U. S. A.,' in reference to ferriage, 'which may be applicable to the said ferry or such portion thereof as may be within the jurisdiction of any of them.'\n The city of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, was authorized by its charter to 'establish, license, and regulate ferries to and from the city,' and to prescribe rates. The charter also provided: 'The council may regulate and license ferries from the city or any place or landing therein to the opposite shore . . . and may require the payment of such reasonable sum for such license as the council shall deem proper; and may impose such reasonable terms and restrictions in relation to the keeping and management of such ferries, and the time, manner, and rates of carriage and transportation of persons and property, as may be \n\n[234 U.S. 333, 339]\n\u00a0\n proper; and provide for the revocation of any such license, and for the punishment, by proper fines and penalties, for the violation of any ordinance prohibiting unlicensed ferries and regulating those established and licensed.' Under this authority, the city adopted the ordinance in question. Section 1 is as follows:\n'No person, persons, or company shall operate a ferryboat, or engage in the business of carrying or transporting persons or property thereon from the city of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and across the St. Mary's river to the opposite shore, without first obtaining a license therefor from the mayor, and by otherwise complying with the provisions of this ordinance.'\n\n The mayor was empowered to grant a license upon the payment of $50 annually for each ferryboat engaged in such transportation, and it was further provided that, before any license should be issued, the person or company desiring the same should make application setting forth a schedule of the rates proposed to be charged within the prescribed territory. Additional provisions fixed the period and frequency of service and the rates to be charged from the licensee's dock within the city to the opposite shore. The mayor was authorized to revoke the license if he was satisfied that any of the provisions of the ordinance were violated. After the passage of this ordinance, one Pocock, operating a ferryboat belonging to the transit company without a license having been obtained therefor, was arrested and fined. Alleging the purpose of the city to enforce the ordinance, and its invalidity, the transit company then brought this suit.\n It will be observed that the question is not simply as to the power of the state to prevent extortion and to fix reasonable ferry rates from the Michigan shore; it is not as to the validity of a mere police regulation governing the manner of conducting the business in order to secure safety and the public convenience. (See Port Richmond, & \n\n[234 U.S. 333, 340]\n\u00a0\n B. Point Ferry Co. v. Hudson County, decided this day [\n234 U.S. 317\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 821].) The ordinance goes beyond this. The ordinance requires a municipal license; and the fundamental question is whether, in the circumstances shown, the state, or the city, acting under its authority, may make its consent a condition precedent to the prosecution of the business. If the state, or the city, may make its consent necessary, it may withhold it. The appellee, having its domicil in Canada, is engaged in commerce between Canada and the United States. At the wharf which it leases for the purpose on the American shore, it receives and lands persons and property. Has the state of Michigan the right to make this commercial intercourse a matter of local privilege, to demand that it shall not be carried on without its permission, and to exact as the price of its consent-if it chooses to give it-the payment of a license fee?\n This question must be answered in the negative. It is urged, on behalf of the city, that the state, either directly or through its municipalities, may establish and license ferries,-may grant ferry franchises (Fanning v. Gregoire, 16 How. 524, 14 L. ed. 1043; Conway v. Taylor, 1 Black, 603, 17 L. ed. 191; Wiggins Ferry Co. v. East St. Louis, \n107 U.S. 365\n, 27 L. ed. 419, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 257). But, since the decision in Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 U.S. 196\n, 29 L. ed. 158, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 382, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 826, it has been clear that, whatever authority the state may have for this purpose, it does not go so far as to enable the state to interdict one in the position of the appellee from conducting the commerce in which it is engaged, or justify the state in imposing exactions upon that commerce in the view that business of this character may be carried on only by virtue of its consent, express or implied. In that case the ferry company was a New Jersey corporation, receiving and landing its passengers and property at its wharf in Philadelphia in substantially the same manner as the appellee transacts its business at its wharf in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. The court held that it was \n\n[234 U.S. 333, 341]\n\u00a0\n not within the power of the state to prevent the ferry company from so doing; that this was an essential part of the interstate transportation which the state could not forbid, or burden by a privilege tax. See Philadelphia & S. Mail S. S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326, 343\n, 30 S. L. ed. 1200, 1204, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 308, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1118. Referring to foreign commerce, the court said in Crutcher v. Kentucky, \n141 \nU.S. 47, 57\n, 35 S. L. ed. 649, 652, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 851: 'Would anyone pretend that a state legislature could prohibit a foreign corporation-an English or a French transportation company, for example-from coming into its borders and landing goods and passengers at its wharves, and soliciting goods and passengers for a return voyage without first obtaining a license from some state officer, and filing a sworn statement as to the amount of its capital stock paid in? And why not? Evidently because the matter is not within the province of state legislation, but within that of national legislation.' Ferry transportation is placed upon the same footing in this respect by the holding in the Gloucester Case (supra, pp. 203, 205), the point of the decision being that the transportation was within the protection of the constitutional grant to Congress. 'It matters not,' said the court, 'that the transportation is made in ferryboats, which pass between the states every hour of the day.'\n The fundamental principle involved has been applied by this court in recent decisions in a great variety of circumstances, and it must be taken to be firmly established that one otherwise enjoying full capacity for the purpose cannot be compelled to take out a local license for the mere privilege of carrying on interstate or foreign commerce.

A number of defenses were set up by the railroad companies, but we are concerned only with the alleged deprivation of Federal right, resulting from the decision of the state court. In the court of original jurisdiction, the common pleas, judgment was rendered in favor of the city. Upon proceedings in error, that judgment was affirmed by the state circuit court, and in the supreme court of the state of Ohio the judgment of the circuit court was affirmed without opinion.\n It is now undertaken to bring the case here, because of alleged violation of rights under the Federal Constitution arising by virtue of  10 of article I. of that instrument, preventing the impairment of contract rights by subsequent legislation.\n In order to bring a case here under  237 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, U.

Stat. 1901, p. 575]), it is well settled that the Federal right must have been set up and adjudicated against the claimant by the judgment of the state court. It is equally well settled that the contention made and passed upon in the state court cannot be enlarged by assignments of error made to bring the case to this court. This proposition is too well settled to need discussion. First Nat. Bank v. Kentucky, 9 Wall, 353, 19 L. ed. 701; Spies v. Illinois, \n123 U.S. 131\n, 31 L. ed. 80, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 21, 22; Zadig v.

L. ed. 1503, 1505, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 941; and cases cited on page 625. An examination of the record shows that the Federal right set up in the court of common pleas, and considered in the circuit court, the latter judgment being affirmed by the supreme court without opinion, concerned an alleged change of decision in the supreme court of Ohio, construing a statute concerning the contract upon which the railroad companies relied, the effect of which, it was alleged, would be to do violence to the contract clause of the Federal Constitution. It was not set up that subsequent legislation had impaired the obligation of the contract of the railroad companies. Therefore, in the light of the decisions of this court above quoted, no Federal right was alleged to be imparied within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States, and no such right was passed upon in the decisions of the courts.\n The contention is made that the presence of the Federal right set up and denied as violative of this clause of the Constitution is shown by the certificate of the Supreme Court, contained in its journal entry affirming the judgment of the circuit court. An examination of the certificate however, does not show that any contention that contract rights were impaired by subsequent state legislation was passed upon adversely to the railroad companies, but shows only that the contention was that the claim of the city, in respect to the contract of September 13th, 1849, sustained by the judgment of the circuit court, and affirmed by the supreme court was in contravention of the defendants' rights under said contract, and impaired their rights under said contract, in violation of the Constitution of the United States, particularly the \n\n[235 U.S. 50, 55]\n\u00a0\n 10th section of article I. thereof; 'which said claims fully appear in the pleadings and record herein, and that such claims were considered by the court and decided adversely to said plaintiffs in error.' The character of the claims thus made we have already described. Moreover a mere certificate of this character cannot bring an additional question into the record, where the record does not otherwise show it to exist. Marvin v.

Because Collins disposed of his crop without the consent of the agents of the pool, he was indicted. He demurred to the indictment upon both state and Federal grounds, setting forth as the latter that the statutes under which he was prosecuted contravened the 14th Amendment of the Federal Constitution, in that they denied to him the equal protection of the laws and deprived him of liberty and property without due process of law, and also were repugnant to the commerce clause and the Federal anti-trust act of July 2, 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 209, chap. 647, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p 3200). The demurrer was overruled and trial was had. There was evidence that the tobacco had been removed by Collins to Cincinnati, Ohio, and there sold; Collins was found guilty and sen- \n\n[234 U.S. 634, 636]\n\u00a0\n tenced to pay a fine. The court of appeals having affirmed the judgment ( 141 Ky. 565, 133 S. W. 233), this writ of error is prosecuted.\n The conviction was under the provisions of  3941a of the Kentucky statutes, being the act of March 21, 1906 (Laws 1906, chap. 117), as amended by the act of March 13, 1908 (Laws 1908, chap. 8). The act of 1906 permitted persons to 'pool or combine' the crops of 'tobacco, wheat, corn, oats, hay, or other farm products' raised by them 'for the purpose of obtaining a better or higher price therefor than could or might be obtained by selling said crops separately or individually.' The persons so agreeing were also allowed to select agents to receive and to sell or dispose of the crops, so placed, in order to accomplish the object of the combination. The amendment of 1908, in addition to giving remedies by way of injunction and damages, provided that the agent, 'when so selected,' should have 'the sole right to sell said crop so pooled or combined,' that it should be unlawful 'for any owner of such crop to sell or dispose of same, and for any person to knowingly purchase the same without the written consent of such agent,' and that 'upon conviction thereof,' a fine should be imposed.\n This statute, as construed by the court of appeals of Kentucky, is not to be regarded as an independent enactment, but is to be viewed in connection with the Kentucky anti-trust act of 1890 (Ky. Stat.  3915), and in the light of  198 of the Kentucky Constitution adopted in 1891. The statute of 1890 forbade the formation of pools or combinations for the purpose of regulating, controlling, or fixing the price of merchandise or property of any kind. Section 198 of the Constitution provided that it should be the duty of the general assembly from time to time to enact such laws as might be necessary 'to prevent all trusts, pools, combinations, or other organizations from combining to depreciate below its real value any article, \n\n[234 U.S. 634, 637]\n\u00a0\n or to enhance the cost of any article above its real value.' It was held that the constitutional provision did not repeal the act of 1890 (Com. v. Grinstead, 108 Ky. 59, 55 S. W. 720, 57 S. W. 471); and in Com. v. International Harvester Co. 131 Ky. 551, 133 Am. St. Rep. 256, 115 S. W. 703, it was further held (approving the views expressed in Owen County Burley Tobacco Soc. v. Brumback, 128 Ky. 137, 107 S. W. 710) that the act of 1906 did not violate  198 of the Constitution, in as much as it 'did not authorize a pool to enhance the cost of crops above their real value,' but that the effect of the last-mentioned act, 'when considered in connection with the act of 1890,  198 of the Constitution, and the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, was to confer, not only upon the farmer, but upon all others, the right to pool their products, skill, or capital for the purpose of obtaining the real value thereof.' See Com. v. Hodges, 137 Ky. 233, 241, 125 S. W. 689; International Harvester Co. v. Com. 144 Ky. 405, 410, 138 S. W. 248; 147 Ky. 557, 559, 144 S. W. 1070; 147 Ky. 564, 565, 144 S. W. 1064. Section 3941a is treated as an amendment to  3915; and, as was said in Com. v. International Harvester Co. 147 Ky. 573, 575, 144 S. W. 1068, the state court 'upheld the validity of both statutes, but also held that the last amended or modified the first to the extent of legalizing pools, trusts, combinations, agreements, etc., but that both statutes are so governed and restricted in their operation by  198, Constitution, as that they cannot be held to allow, but, on the contrary, prohibit, persons, associations, copartnerships, or corporations, engaged or participating in a pool, trust, combination, or agreement, by means thereof, to fix, control, or regulate the price of any commodity or article by raising or depreciating, or attempting to raise or depreciate, it above or below its real value.'\n As the present prosecution was under his legislation, thus construed as constituting in effect a single act, the \n\n[234 U.S. 634, 638]\n\u00a0\n question presented is the same as that decided by this court in International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, \n234 U.S. 216\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 853. It was found that the statute in its reference to 'real value' prescribed no standard of conduct that it was possible to know; that it violated the fundamental principles of justice embraced in the conception of due process of law in compelling men, on peril of indictment, to guess what their goods would have brought under other conditions not ascertainable.\n The Harvester Company was prosecuted for being a party to a price- raising combination; Collins, for breaking a combination agreement and selling outside the pool which he had joined. With respect to each, the test of the legality of the combination was said to be whether it raised prices above the 'real value.' If it did-in Collins' case-he would be subject to penalties for remaining in the combination; if it did not, he would be punishable for not keeping his tobacco in the pool. He was thus bound to ascertain the 'real value;' to determine his conduct not according to the actualities of life, or by reference to knowable criteria, but by speculating upon imaginary conditions and endeavoring to conjecture what would be the value under other and so-called normal circumstances with fair competition, eliminating the abnormal influence of the combination itself, and of all other like combinations, and of still other combinations which these were organized to oppose. The objection that the statute, by reason of its uncertainty, was fundamentally defective, was as available to Collins as it was to the Harvester Company.\n In this view, it is unnecessary to consider the objection under the commerce clause, or the alleged conflict, as to interstate transactions, with the Federal antitrust act.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCORNELL STEAMBOAT CO. v. PHOENIX CONST CO(1914)\nNo. 933\nArgued: Decided: May 11, 1914\n\n\n\n Mr. E. Crosby Kindleberger for defendant in error.[ Cornell Steamboat Co v. Phoenix Const Co \n233 U.S. 593\n (1914) ]\n\n\n[233 U.S. 593, 595]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The cases are before us on a motion to dismiss or affirm, and the facts essential to its consideration are these:\n The Phoenix Construction Company, defendant in error, brought three actions to recover damages alleged to have resulted from the negligence of the Cornell Steamboat Company, plaintiff in error, in permitting its tugs and canal boats on three separate occasions in the year 1908 to collide with certain scows and other property of the Construction Company on the Hudson river. The cases were tried by a referee, resulting in judgments against the \n\n[233 U.S. 593, 596]\n\u00a0\n Steamboat Company, which were affirmed by the appellate division of the supreme court (146 App. Div. 951, 131 N. Y. Supp. 1138), and by the court of appeals (210 N. Y. 113, 103 N. E. 891). These writs of error were then prosecuted to the court below, to which the records were remitted by the court of appeals, upon the theory that Federal questions were involved and wrongly decided.\n The Construction Company was a contractor for the Board of Water Supply of the City of New York, and in the year 1908 was engaged in making test borings in the bed of the Hudson river for the purpose of determining where it was best to tunnel under the river in the construction of the Catskill aqueduct. At the times of the collisions complained of boring operations were carried on simultaneously at four points on a line across the river near Storm King mountain, and it was with plants established at certain of these borings, consisting of pipes, drills, platforms, scows, and other property, that canal boats in tow of the Steamboat Company collided. The referee found in each case that the location of the borings was known to the masters of the tugs, who had many time passed between them with tows; that upon the nights of the accidents, lights which could be seen for more than a mile were displayed on the borings; that the collisions were the direct result of the negligence of the servants of the Steamboat Company in charge of its tugs, and that the Construction Company was in nowise negligent. In addition, considering the defense made by the Steamboat Company that it was not liable because the structures of the Construction Company were unlawful obstructions in the channel, erected and maintained without a lawful permit from the Secretary of War, and without authority of Congress, as required by  9 and 10 of the act of March 3, 1899 (chap. 425, 30 Stat. at L. 1151; U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3540, 3541), the findings of the referee were in substance these: In 1906, upon the application of the \n\n[233 U.S. 593, 597]\n\u00a0\n Board of Water Supply of New York City, a permit was issued by the Secretary of War, authorizing borings to be made in the bed of the Hudson river at certain points near New Hamburg, and that subsequently such permit was modified by communications signed by members of the corps of engineers of the United States Army located in New York city, and having charge of the district in which the work was being executed, so as to permit the borings to be carried on at points near Storm King. Under these facts the referee stated that, in his opinion, it was extremely doubtful whether the Construction Company was lawfully authorized to establish its boring plants in the river but held that even although the permits did not constitute lawful authority and the boring plants were unlawful obstructions in the river, the Steamboat Company was not, because of that circumstance, relieved of its duty to exercise ordinary care, and his decision in each case was based solely upon the fact that the collisions were caused by the exclusive negligence of the steamboat Company. In affirming the judgments the appellate division filed no opinion, although it appears that two of the justices concurred 'solely on the ground that authority was given by the Secretary of War to make the borings and anchor the barges in the river,' from which it is to be inferred that a majority of the court were of opinion that the judgments were amply sustained by the reasoning of the referee. The court of appeals, however, while stating that, as the actions were for common-law negligence, the ground of negligence stated by the referee was adequate to sustain the judgments, also considered the contention based upon the statute, and additionally placed the affirmance upon the conclusion that the facts found by the referee, which were concluded by the unanimous affirmance by the appellate division, were sufficient to establish authority given by the Secretary of War for the operations carried on by the Construction Company, and that the \n\n[233 U.S. 593, 598]\n\u00a0\n contention of the Steamboat Company that action by Congress was essential to authorize the Construction Company to do the work was without foundation.\n The assignments of error here insisted upon as involving a Federal question are directed to the conclusions of the court of appeals last stated.\n Clearly, the judgment of the court of appeals which is under review rests upon two propositions: (1) The sufficiency of the authority from a Federal point of view under which the Phoenix Construction Company was carrying on its work in the bed of the river, and in the execution of which work it had anchored in the river its barges and other appliances incidental to the boring operations in which it was engaged. (2) The absence of all negligence on the part of the Construction Company, resulting from the place where its appliances were anchored in the stream, or from any other cause, and the happening of the accident solely because of negligence on the part of the Steamboat Company. It is elementary that where the judgment of a state court which is under review by this court rests upon two or more grounds, one or more of which are Federal and others of which are not Federal, because resting solely upon state grounds independent of Federal rights, and which state grounds are therefore completely adequate to sustain the judgment under consideration, no jurisdiction obtains to review. This doctrine, it is insisted, is here applicable for the following reason: Because, conceding that the first proposition, that is, the rightfulness of the acts of the company in placing its appliances in the stream, involves Federal questions which are reviewable, the second proposition upon which the court based its decision, that is, the happening of the accident solely as the result of the negligent conduct of the Steamboat Company, is an independent state ground, broad enough to sustain the judgment without the necessity of considering the Federal question involved in the first proposition. \n\n[233 U.S. 593, 599]\n\u00a0\n But the mistake lies in the contention that the finding that there was no negligence on the part of the Construction Company and that the negligence of the Steamboat Company was the sole cause of the damage suffered involved purely questions of state cognizance, involving no Federal considerations whatever. We say this is the error because the determination of the issue of negligence upon the hypothesis that there was no Federal authority given to place the obstructions in the river necessarily involves a consideration of the nature of the obstructions and the ascertainment of whether, in and of themselves, they so interfered with or impeded the right to navigate the river, that is, to carry on interstate commerce by using the river, as to cause the mere presence of the obstructions to constitute negligence per se; that is, to render the conclusion necessary that their mere presence was the efficient and proximate cause of the accident complained of. Because the elements involved in the decision of this Federal question are intermingled with the elements necessary to be considered to determine whether there was negligence irrespective of the Federal Right affords no reason for not considering and disposing of the issue which the case presents from the Federal aspect, or to treat it as nonexisting. It is indeed true that the fact of negligence, in and of itself, abstractly considered, may be a state question, concerning which we would accept, and, indeed, it may be conceded, would be bound by, the conclusion of the state court. But when negligence involves and concerns a subject of Federal jurisdiction which it is our duty to decide, to the extent necessary to enable us to discharge that duty, we must consider and review the subject independent of the action of the state court. Southern P. Co. v. Schuyler, \n227 \nU.S. 601, 612\n, 57 S. L. ed. 662, 669, 40 L.R.A.(N.S.) 901, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 277.\n The motion to dismiss being thus adversely disposed of, it remains to consider the motion to affirm, which we think should be granted because of the entire want of \n\n[233 U.S. 593, 600]\n\u00a0\n foundation, that is, in substance, the frivolousness, of the proposition upon which the contention as to jurisdiction to review must rest, and we have reached this conclusion for the following reasons: (a) because, under the circumstances disclosed by the record, we are of the opinion that it is manifest that whether the ingredients of negligence be considered from the Federal point of view or from the point of view of the general law, it clearly results that the injury which the Construction Company suffered was purely and exclusively, as held by all the courts below, the result of the negligence of the Steamboat Company, unaffected in a legal sense by the act of the Construction Company in placing its works in the stream at the places and under the circumstances stances shown. (b) Because, reaching this conclusion, we are of the opinion that the question of the sufficiency or insufficiency of the Federal authority by which the appliances of the Construction Company were placed in the river becomes wholly negligible and need not be considered, because, even assuming the want of authority, such absence of authority conferred upon the Steamboat Company no right to negligently injure the property of the Construction Company. In other words, we are of the opinion that, conceding that the appliances and boats of the Construction Company were in the river at the points stated without authority, that fact did not endow the Steamboat Company with a license to become a wrongdoer free from responsibility, and did not exempt it, therefore, from liability for the consequences of a wrong inflicted solely by its own negligence, not contributed to in any way by the Construction Company.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","47":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCURRIDEN v. MIDDLETON(1914)\nNo. 152\nArgued: Decided: March 16, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. Lorenzo A. Bailey, William E. Chandler, and William L. Chambers for appellant.\n\n\n[232 U.S. 633, 635]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. Hilton Jackson for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill in equity against the defendant Middleton and two others not served, to which Middleton demurred. The demurrer was sustained and the bill dismissed by the supreme court of the District, and the decree was affirmed by the court of appeals. 37 App. D. C. 568. The allegations in brief are that Middleton was a patent lawyer and personal friend of the plaintiff, that he brought to the plaintiff's attention a patent fluid and apparatus, representing them to be valuable, with details of fact confirming the statement, and representing that Middleton was acting as agent of the patentees; that the plaintiff, relying upon the representations, paid money and incurred obligations, amounting in all to some $40,000, all he had, for purchase of the patent rights, with an agreement that a company should be formed to work them; that a company was formed, but that it turned out that the fluid and apparatus were worthless, that Middleton was interested in the patent, and that his representations were false. It is alleged further that Middleton got complete control of the company, that an arrangement was made with it by which the company was to assume and pay outstanding notes of the plaintiff, but that it failed to do so, and is now \n\n[232 U.S. 633, 636]\n\u00a0\n hopelessly insolvent; that all Middleton's acts were parts of a conspiracy to defraud the plaintiff, and that Middleton has all the books and papers of the company needed to prove the fraud. The prayers are for discovery and a decree that the defendants 'shall make due restitution [of his property] to the complainant by paying to him the amounts of money by him paid out as aforesaid,' and for general relief.\n As there is a prayer for final relief, the prayer for discovery must stand or fall with that; at least, in a case like the present; there is no need to consider whether or how far bills for discovery alone have been displaced by the powers now given in actions at law. The relief sought is simply a decree for damages,-for a large part of the moneys paid and obligations incurred were paid and incurred to others than Middleton, so that although the word 'restitution' is used, there is no attempt to rescind, to follow a specific fund, or to establish a trust. Being a suit for damages, the proper remedy is an action at law, as was held below. Buzard v. Houston, \n119 U.S. 347\n, 30 L. ed. 451, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249. It is said that the facts are complicated, but they are not so on the allegations of the bill, which merely disclose a series of acts alleged to have been parts of the plan to deceive; and further, mere complication of facts alone and difficulty of proof are not a basis of equity jurisdiction. See United States v. Bitter Root Development Co. \n200 \nU.S. 451, 472\n, 50 S. L. ed. 550, 560, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 318. It now is asked that if the suit cannot be maintained in equity, it may be transferred to the law side, and under equity rule 22; but that rule has no application to the case. Rev. Stat.  913, U. S.

Its purpose is to review a judgment for contempt against Curtin upon presentment of the Federal grand jury for refusing to answer certain questions in the same proceeding considered in the Burdick Case in regard to a certain article published in the New York Tribune. Curtin is a reporter on that paper. He declined to answer the questions, on the ground that the answers would tend to incriminate him. At a subsequent hearing a pardon issued by the President was offered him (it was the same in substance as that offered Burdick), and he was again questioned. He declined to receive the pardon or to answer the questions, on the same ground as before. He was, on presentment of the grand jury, adjudged guilty of \n\n[236 U.S. 96, 97]\n\u00a0\n contempt, fined as Burdick was, with the same leave to purge himself of the contempt, the court deciding that the pardon was valid and sufficient for immunity. Upon Curtin again refusing to answer, the judgment was made absolute and he was committed to the custody of the United States marshal.\n It will be observed, therefore, the case is almost identical in its facts with the Burdick Case and exactly the same in principle. On the authority of that case, therefore, the judgment is reversed and the case remanded, with instruction to dismiss the proceedings in contempt and discharge Curtin from custody.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","49":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nD.E. FOOTE & CO. v. STANLEY(1914)\nNo. 159\nArgued: January 16, 1914Decided: February 24, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 494, 495]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiffs are engaged in packing oysters taken from the waters of Maryland, Virginia, and New Jersey, and shipped to Baltimore, where they are inspected under the provisions of the Maryland oyster law. This comprehensive statute contains 82 sections, one of which ( 69) provides for the appointment of 20 special inspectors, to be paid $45 per month each, during the season. They are required to inspect all oysters in the district to which they are assigned, and to give a certificate to buyer and seller in substantially the following form:\n'I hereby certify that I have this day inspected for Captain ________ of the schooner ________, a cargo of oysters, sold to ________, and found the same to contain _____ bushels of merchantable oysters, and _____ bushels of unmerchantable oysters. . . .'\n\n The section further provides that 'a charge of 1 cent per bushel is hereby levied to help defray the expenses of such inspection and the other expenses of the State Fishery Force, upon all oysters unloaded from vessels at the place where said oysters are to be no further shipped in bulk in vessels.'\n The fee was to be charged equally to the buyer and seller, and in case it was not paid at the end of the week, the property of the party indebted was to be levied on and sold by the comptroller 'as in cases of taxes in default, without further process of law.' \n\n[232 U.S. 494, 496]\n\u00a0\n The four plaintiffs refused to pay the inspection fees charged against them between October, 1910, and April, 1911. The comptroller threatened to enforce collection by levy and sale, and they filed a bill in the circuit court of Baltimore city, seeking an injunction on the ground that the inspection fees were excessive and constituted a burden on interstate commerce and a violation of the provision of the Constitution that 'no state shall, without the consent of the Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws.' [Art. 1,  10.]\n The case was heard on an agreed statement of facts which, in addition to those above recited, showed that the act of April, 1910, was a re- enactment of sections of a prior statute (Code of Maryland, art. 72) which was substantially like the present law, with the same charge of 1 cent a bushel for measuring oysters.\n Extracts from various annual reports of the comptroller were stipulated into the record. They show that the salaries of the inspectors amounted to about $14,000 per annum. After the deduction of salaries of these inspectors there was for 1909 and 1910 respectively, an excess of $ 22,010 and $28,680. This annual excess was carried to the credit of the oyster fund, provided for both in the repealed and re-enacted oyster law. In the report of the comptroller for 1909, he says: 'The tax as to 1 cent per bushel on all oysters inspected in this state, as enacted by chapter 488 of the Acts of 1908, has been sufficient not only to pay the cost of such inspections, but also to carry to this [oyster] fund the balance or excess of $22,010.95.'\n In the report for 1910, he says: 'During the fiscal year ending September 30, 1910, the receipts of taxes on oysters amounted to $43,671. 94. The disbursements for account of salaries of the measurers and inspectors of oysters were $14,991, leaving a balance or ex- \n\n[232 U.S. 494, 497]\n\u00a0\n cess of $28,680.94, which was carried to the credit of the Maryland state oyster fund.'\n'The receipts from dredging and tonging licenses show a heavy shrinkage by reason of fewer boats being engaged in the industry; nevertheless the excess tax of 1 cent per bushel on oysters sold amounted to $28,680.94, making the fund self-sustaining for the year' (1911).\n\n Section 30 of the oyster law referred to provides that the oyster fund shall only be drawn upon for 'the purpose of maintaining sufficient and proper police regulations for the protection of fish and oysters in Maryland waters, and in the payment of the officers and men, and keeping in repair and supplying the necessary means of sailing the boats and vessels of the state fishery force.'\n After a hearing and consideration of the facts submitted, the circuit court held that the inspection tax was valid, refused to enjoin its collection, and dismissed the bill. That judgment was affirmed by the court of appeals (117 Md. 335, 82 Atl. 380), and the case was brought here by writ of error.\n Messrs. W. Thomas Hemp and George Whitelock for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[232 U.S. 494, 499]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edgar Allan Poe, Attorney General of Maryland for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Lamar:\n\n\n[232 U.S. 494, 502]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiffs are engaged in the business of packing oysters in the city of Baltimore, and, during the season of 1910-11 purchased 736,000 bushels, of which 494,000 bushels were taken from the waters of the state of Maryland, 228,000 from the waters of the state of Virginia, and 14,118 from the state of New Jersey. These oysters were inspected in Baltimore by officers appointed under the provisions of the Maryland statute, which fixed an inspection fee of 1 cent per bushel to be paid, one half by the seller and one half by the buyer. The plaintiffs having refused to pay the inspection charge assessed against them, litigation followed. The decision was against their claim of immunity under art. I,  8 and 10, of the Constitution. The case was then brought here on the ground that the inspection fee of 1 cent per bushel charge was excessive, that it interfered with interstate \n\n[232 U.S. 494, 503]\n\u00a0\n commerce, and levied an unlawful impost duty upon goods shipped into Maryland from other states.\n\n 1. \nThe Constitution prohibits a state from regulating interstate commerce, but at the same time authorizes the collection of the necessary expenses of its inspection laws, with the result that interstate commerce is to that extent lawfully burdened. Inspection is intended to determine the weight, condition, quantity, and quality of merchandise to be sold within or beyond the state's borders. It is usually 'accomplished by looking at or weighing or measuring the thing to be inspected.' (New York v. Compagnie G en erale Transatlantique, \n107 U.S. 62\n, 27 L. ed. 384, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 87), though there may be cases in which some degree of supervision or policing is required in order to secure the proper certification of the property intended for sale or shipment. But while the two duties may sometimes overlap, there is a difference between policing and inspection, and if the state imposes upon one set of officers the performance of the two duties, and pays the whole or a part of the joint expenses out of inspection fees, it must be made to appear that such tax does not materially exceed the cost of inspection,-the burden in such cases being on those seeking to collect the combined charge. For if the cost of inspection is so intermingled with other expenses as to make it impossible to separate the two, interstate commerce might be burdened by fees collected both for inspection and revenue,-for a lawful and for an unlawful purpose. Such is the contention here, the plaintiffs insisting that the fees are collected partly for inspecting oysters and partly for the cost of policing the waters of Chesapeake bay; while the defendant insists that the charge is collected and spent solely for inspection.\n\n 2. \nInspection necessarily involves expense, and the power to fix the fee, to cover that expense, is left primarily to the legislature, which must exercise discretion in determining the amount to be charged, since it is im- \n\n[232 U.S. 494, 504]\n\u00a0\n possible to tell exactly how much will be realized under the future operations of any law. Beside, receipts and disbursements may so vary from time to time that the surplus of one year may be needed to supply the deficiency of another. If, therefore, the fees exceed cost by a sum not unreasonable, no question can arise as to the validity of the tax so far as the amount of the charge is concerned. And even if it appears that the sum collected is beyond what is needed for inspection expenses, the courts do not interfere, immediately on application, because of the presumption that the legislature will reduce the fees to a proper sum. Red 'C' Oil Mfg. Co. v. Board of Agriculture, \n222 U.S. 393\n, 56 L. ed. 244, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 152. But when the facts show that what was known to be an unnecessary amount has been levied, or that what has proved to be an unreasonable charge is continued, then they are obliged to act in the light of those facts, and to give effect to the provision of the Constitution prohibiting the collection by a state of more than is necessary for executing its inspection laws. In such inquiry they treat the fees fixed by the legislature for inspection proper as prima facie reasonable, and do not enter into any nice calculation as to the difference between cost and collection; nor will they declare the fees to be excessive unless it is made clearly to appear that they are obviously and largely beyond what is needed to pay for the inspection services rendered. Still, effect must be given to the provision of the Constitution, which, in unusual and emphatic terms, permits the state to collect only what is 'absolutely necessary.' If, therefore, it is shown, that the fees are disproportionate to the service rendered, or, that they include the cost of something beyond legitimate inspection to determine quality and condition, the tax must be declared void because such costs, by necessary operation, obstruct the freedom of commerce among the states.

Jones, \n225 U.S. 501\n, 56 L. ed. 1182, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 715.\n\n 3. \nThe unreasonableness of inspection fees may appear from the language of the act, as in D. E. Foote & Co. v. Clagett, 116 Md. 228, 81 Atl. 511, where a charge of 2 cents a bushel on oysters was collected, under a statute which provided that one half was to be used for inspection and the other half was to be used for replacing shells on the natural beds for the purpose of increasing the oyster crop. That law was declared void by the court of appeals of Maryland, because of the provision that one half of the inspection fee should be applied to other than the inspection purpose. The present statute contains language susceptible of the same construction, for it provides for an inspection fee of 1 cent per bushel to be 'levied to help pay the salary of the inspectors and the other expenses of the State Fishery Force.'\n As the act itself makes a clear distinction between inspection expenses 'and other expenses,' the question at once arises as to whether the state did not provide for the collection of more than was 'absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws,' thereby rendering the statute void because it included the cost of 'something beyond legitimate inspection to determine quality and condition.' Brimmer v. Rebman, \n138 U.S. 83\n, 34 L. ed. 864, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 485, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 213.\n This objection, apparent on the face of the act, was sought to be answered by the suggestion that  69, which levied the tax, was but a part of an elaborate system of inspection running through the whole law, 'the enforcement of which was an inseparable part of the duty of the State Fishery Force,' and that 'the expense of such inspection is a component part of all the expenses of that force.' 117 Md. 335, 82 Atl. 380. It was urged that, in addition to inspecting oysters as they were unloaded from ves- \n\n[232 U.S. 494, 506]\n\u00a0\n sels, the Fishery Force performed other inspection duties such as preventing what were known as 'buyboats' from secretly carrying culls and other unmerchantable oysters beyond the limits of the state for consumption or transplanting. But even if it be conceded that these, or like services, could be classed as inspection within the meaning of the Constitution, they form only a part of the many and various duties imposed upon the Fishery Force. That organization is supplied with men and boats, and required to patrol, day and night, the waters of Chesapeake bay to prevent unlicensed boats from taking oysters from improper tonging or dredging, and to see that shells and culls are returned to the natural beds,-provisions intended for the preservation of the supply rather than determining the merchantable quality of oysters offered for sale. Other noninspection duties might be named, but the foregoing will suffice to show that inspection, policing, and business expenses are to be paid for out of inspection fees.\n\n 3. \nBut the commingling of these various duties, paid for out of a fund raised for inspection, does not necessarily show that the fee is excessive. For the presumption of invalidity arising from such intermingling might be met by carrying the burden of showing that, while the statute required payment out of which joint fund, the collections were not sufficient, but only helped, to pay the definitely ascertained expenses of inspection. The question of reasonableness, therefore, may be considered in the light of the practical operation of the law with a view of determining, with reasonable certainty, the permanent relation between the amount collected and the cost of inspecting. The court of appeals of Maryland, following the intimation in Turner v. Maryland, \n107 U.S. 38\n, 27 L. ed. 370, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44, declined to pass on the question, upon the ground that a court could not decide whether 'a charge or duty under an inspection law is or is not excessive.' That suggestion, \n\n[232 U.S. 494, 507]\n\u00a0\n however, is opposed to the distinct rulings in Brimmer v. Rebman, supra, and other cases above cited, which hold that it is the duty of the courts to pass upon the question, so as to protect the private citizen against the payment of inspection fees larger than those authorized by the Constitution.\n\n 4. \nThe Maryland statute provided for that kind of inspection that could be performed by 'looking at or measuring the thing to be inspected' ( New York v. Compagnie G en erale Transatlantique, \n107 U.S. 62\n, 27 L. ed. 384, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 87). It fixed the amount of salary to be paid the inspectors for such services, so that the cost was definitely known. The receipts, too, are reasonably certain in view of collections in the past.\n The present statute is a re-enactment of an old law levying the same charge of 1 cent per bushel. Under the operations of that law it appeared that about 4,000,000 bushels were inspected each year, producing a revenue of $40,000, one third of which was sufficient to pay the salaries of the inspectors, the other two thirds being appropriated to the 'other expenses of the Fishery Force.' The comptroller, in his annual reports, called the attention of the legislature to the fact that, as required, this 'excess' had been credited to the oyster fund. This fund was to be used-not for inspection purposes, but for 'maintaining sufficient and proper police regulations for the protection of fish and oysters in Maryland waters, and the payment of the officers and men, and for keeping in repair and supplying the necessary means of sailing the boats and vessels of the State Fishery Force.'\n Even during the year following the enactment of the new statute, and the failure of many to pay, pending the decision as to the validity of the tax, the collections were in excess of the cost of inspection. In the light of the operation of the previous act, and the failure to show that the amount collected under the new would not be more than was necessary for the expenses of inspection proper, \n\n[232 U.S. 494, 508]\n\u00a0\n the present statute must be held to be void. The excess collected may have been valid as a tax on property in Maryland, but was a burden on interstate commerce when levied upon oysters coming from other states. This fact renders the whole tax void, because there is no claim that the intrastate commerce can be separated from the interstate shipments, or that the legislature would have taxed one and left the other untaxed.\n Judgment reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDALE v. PATTISON(1914)\nNo. 330\nArgued: April 23, 1914Decided: June 8, 1914\n\n\n\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Pitney:\n David Rohrer for many years prior to November 5, 1909, owned and operated a distillery in Montgomery county, Ohio. On that day he was adjudicated a bank- \n\n[234 U.S. 399, 400]\n\u00a0\n rupt, and the appellants were appointed his trustees. In the following month they filed an application in the bankruptcy proceedings, setting forth that in the distillery warehouses of the bankrupt there were stored about 9,800 barrels of Bourbon and rye whiskies, to which there were many conficting claims; among the claimants being certain named persons to whom it was alleged the bankrupt had pledged or hypothecated certain barrels of the whiskies. One of the parties so named was the respondent, Edward M. Pattison. The application prayed that all of the claimants be notified of the proceedings, be made parties thereto, and be required to set up their respective claims. Pattison filed an answer and intervening petition, claiming that 210 barrels of whisky (specifying them by numbers) were a part of a lot of 800 barrels that had been pledged or hypothecated to him by Rohrer as security for certain loans; the remainder of the 800 barrels having been sold by Rohrer without the knowledge of Pattison. It was denied that the whiskies were or ever had been in Rohrer's possession, it being alleged that all of them, as soon as manufactured, were placed in the storage warehouse in the possession and control of the government of the United States, and that certain moneys were loaned by Pattison to Rohrer, to secure payment of which the latter assigned and transferred in writing to the former his entire interest in certain designated barrels of whisky then on storage in said warehouse, the agreement and transfer being evidenced by documents in the form of warehouse receipts, of which the following is a sample: of their manufacture, the warehouse stamps thereon, and the number of the bonded\n No. 750.\n Stored in Warehouse.\n 56 bbls. in No. 2.\n 94 bbls. in No. 1.\n The David Rohrer Distillery, montgomery County.\n Fire Copper Bourbon and Pure Rye.\n Brand and Distillery Established in 1847\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 399, 401]\n\u00a0\n Germantown, O., Feb. 23, 1906.\n Received in my distillery, Bonded Warehouse No. 11, first district of Ohio, for account and subject to the order of E.

The circuit court of appeals reversed the district court, and remanded the case for further proceedings (115 C. C. A. 639, 196 Fed. 5). Thereupon the district court, in obedience to the mandate, overruled the demurrer and rendered final judgment in favor of Pattison, which was affirmed by the court of appeals; and an appeal to this court was then allowed.\n Mr. Lee Warren James for appellants.\n Messrs. W. H. Mackoy and M. L. Buch-Walter for appellee. \n\n[234 U.S. 399, 404]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The transactions in question, as between Rohrer, the bankrupt, and Pattison, the appellee, are not distinguishable from those that were under consideration in Taney v. Penn. Nat. Bank, \n232 U.S. 174\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 288. In that case the distilling company deposited as security for the loan made by the bank certain gauger's certificates, in addition to warehouse receipts issued by itself. But the sole significance of the gauger's certificates was that they constituted evidence that the whiskies had been deposited in the storehouse in barrels marked and numbered as required by the act of Congress. Since it is admitted in the present case that the whiskies in question were in fact on storage, as men tioned in the warehouse receipts delivered by Rohrer to Pattison, and that the barrels were stamped, marked, and numbered as therein stated, the fact that no gauger's certificate was delivered to Pattison is of no present consequence.\n The legal effect of such a transaction depends upon the local law. In Taney v. Penn Nat. Bank, upon finding that, by the law of Pennsylvania, the ordinary rule as to the effect of the retention of physical possession by the vendor of personal property, which he is capable of delivering to the vendee, is not applied by the courts of that state to cases where the inherent nature of the transaction and the attendant circumstances are such as to preclude the possibility of a delivery by the vendor that would be consistent with the avowed and fair purpose of the sale, or where the absence of a physical delivery is excused by the usages of the trade or business in which the sale is made, we held that, considering the situation of the property and the usages of the business, the transaction between the distiller and the bank was valid, and gave to the latter a lien upon the whisky superior to that of the trustee in bankruptcy.\n The question here presented is whether the local law of \n\n[234 U.S. 399, 405]\n\u00a0\n Ohio so far differs from that of Pennsylvania that a different result should be reached. In behalf of appellants it is insisted that there is in Ohio a settled legislative policy with reference to the change of possession necessary for the creation of liens on personal property. Section 8560 of the General Code is cited (formerly  4150, Rev. Stat.). It reads as follows:\n'Sec. 8560. A mortgage, or conveyance intended to operate as a mortgage, of goods and chattels, which is not accompanied by an immediate delivery, and followed by an actual and continued change of possession of the things mortgaged, shall be absolutely void as against the creditors of the mortgagor, subsequent purchasers, and mortgagees in good faith, unless the mortgage, or a true copy thereof, be forthwith deposited as directed in the next succeeding section.'\n\n It is insisted that this clearly and unmistakably establishes the doctrine that any transaction designed to give a security in personal property, if not accompanied by an actual change of possession, must be placed in the form of a chattel mortgage and filed for record, in order to be good as against creditors. It seems to us, however, that we should not fail to consider the wellrecognized distinction between a chattel mortgage and a pledge. A mortgage of chattels imports a present conveyance of the legal title, subject to defeasance upon performance of an express condition subsequent, contained either in the same or in a separate instrument. It may or may not be accompanied by a delivery of possession. On the other hand, where title to the property is not presently transferred, but possession only is given, with power to sell upon default in the performance of a condition, the transaction is a pledge, and not a mortgage.\n There is no question that in Ohio, as elsewhere, a chattel mortgage, as well as a pledge, is valid between the parties, although not recorded. And, without the statute, it would \n\n[234 U.S. 399, 406]\n\u00a0\n be good as against creditors, purchasers, and mortgagees in good faith. The primary purpose of the act is to protect persons of these classes, who might otherwise sustain losses by relying upon the possession and apparent ownership of the chattels by the mortgagor. In the case of an ordinary pledge, there is no need of recording, since the pledgeor at once parts with possession.\n But what shall be said when the transaction relates to personal property which is so situated that it is not within the power of the owner to deliver it to mortgagee or pledgee, and of which he has no such visible possession and apparent ownership as would probably be relied upon by creditors, purchasers, and mortgagees? Does  8560, Gen. Code, which declares that mortgages in such case shall be invalid against the designated third parties unless recorded necessarily apply to transactions in the nature of a pledge, which are not mentioned in terms? The effect would be to greatly hamper, sometimes to prevent, transactions in the nature of a pledge, where only constructive possession of the property could be transferred. We cannot give to the section cited so extensive a meaning, in the absence of a decision by the state court adopting that construction. None such is referred to.\n It is contended that a different rule exists in Ohio as to the delivery of possession in the case of pledges from that which obtains in the case of sales. Section 8619, Gen. Code (Rev. Stat.  4197), is cited.\n'Sec. 8619. When goods and chattels remain for five years in the possession of a person, or those claiming under him, to whom a pretended loan thereof has been made, they shall be the property of such person, unless a reservation of a right to them is made to the lender in writing, and the instrument recorded within six months after the loan is made, in the recorder's office of the county where one or both of the parties reside, or unless such instrument is filed as provided by law with respect to chattel mort- \n\n[234 U.S. 399, 407]\n\u00a0\n gages. But if a loan of goods and chattels is made to an art museum association within this state, such reservation of a right to them may be so made and recorded at any time within five years from the date of the loan.'\n\n But in the Code, this section is made a part of chapter 4, entitled 'Statute of Frauds and Perjuries.' It partakes also of the nature of a statute of limitations. We are unable to see anything in it to establish the asserted distinction between sales and pledges, and we are unable to find that any such force has been given to it by the courts of Ohio.\n The cases to which particular reference is made are Gibson v. Chillicothe State Bank, 11 Ohio St. 311; Thorne v. First Nat. Bank, 37 Ohio St. 254, and Hunt v. Bode, 66 Ohio St. 255, 64 N. E. 126. All are decisions by the supreme court of the state. In the Gibson Case, in an action of trespass for levying upon and detaining certain property by virtue of an execution against their bailees, plaintiffs, in order to prove their property and right of possession, gave in evidence certain warehouse receipts, reading in substance as follows: 'Received, Chillicothe, November 13, 1852, of Messrs. Gibson, Stockwell, & Company, and for their account, the following property, in good order, which we agree to hold irrevocably subject to their order, they having a lien thereon for the full cost of the same.' It was held that the legal effect of such a receipt was to pass the general property and right of possession to the holder, and that this effect was not impaired by the recital that the holder had a lien upon the property. The court, in its opinion, recognized that receipts of this kind, from long and general use in commerce and trade, had come to have a well-understood import amoung business men, which (as the court said) ought not to be confounded or perhaps even qualified by a strict construction of the literal and grammatical meaning of the words employed. And the court proceeded to say: 'The receipts in this case are in \n\n[234 U.S. 399, 408]\n\u00a0\n some particulars variant from each other; and yet we have no doubt they would all be recognized by commercial men as of like import and equal validity as warehouse receipts. And if so, they as absolutely transfer the general property of the goods and chattels therein expressed as would a bill of sale. They are a kind of instrument extensively used by commercial men as the most convenient mode of transfer and constructive delivery of property, and facilitating the ready realization of the price of products by the producer remote from market. Public policy, as well as respect to good faith, requires that those, like other instruments of commerce, should be so regarded in courts as not to unjustly impair confidence in them elsewhere. And this view of the legal effect of such instruments, we think fully sustained by the authorities cited by counsel; and especially by the case of Gibson v. Stevens, 8 How. 384, 12 L. ed. 1123.' It was therefore held that, in spite of the recital that Gibson, Stockwell, & Company had a 'lien thereon for the full cost of the same,' the warehouse receipts tended to prove that the plaintiffs had a general ownership in the property, and that the trial court erred in ruling otherwise. The citation of Gibson v. Stevens is significant, because in that case this court, in an opinion by Mr. Chief Justice Taney, recognized that where personal property is, from its character or situation, not capable of actual delivery, the delivery of a warehouse receipt or other evidence of title is sufficient to transfer the property and right of possession to another; and also because this decision was based in large part upon the usages of trade and commerce.\n In Thorne v. First Nat. Bank, ubi supra, it was held that an instrument in the form of a warehouse receipt, executed by a debtor to his creditor, upon property owned by the debtor, who was not a warehouseman, and made for the sole purpose of securing the creditor, was void as against other creditors where the property remained in the possession of the debtor. The court cited and relied upon Rev. \n\n[234 U.S. 399, 409]\n\u00a0\n Stat.  4150, above quoted, and in effect held that the attempt by the warehouse receipts to establish a lien upon the personal property was in conflict with the policy of that section, and therefore invalid as to a creditor. Gibson v. Chillicothe State Bank was distinguished upon the ground that in that case the warehouse receipts were offered to show ownership, and not a mere agreement for securing an indebtedness. It will, however, be observed that in the Thorne Case the property in question was in the possession of the borrowers, and there was nothing in its character or situation to prevent an actual delivery of it to the lender.\n In Hunt v. Bode, ubi supra, which is the most recent case upon the subject to which our attention has been called, one Stothfang had delivered to a bank certain warehouse receipts for whisky as collateral for a loan of money made to him by the bank, and thereafter undertook to make a second transfer or pledge to another party, subject to the claim of the bank. A copy of this instrument was served upon the bank, and it was notified to retain possession of the warehouse receipts pledged with it as collateral security for its claim against the pledgeor, and after it was duly paid, the balance of the receipts were to be turned over to the second pledgee. The transaction was sustained, the court remarking: 'Delivery of the property pledged is generally essential to a valid pledge, and it is equally true that to make a valid sale or transfer of any species or article of personal property, a delivery of the property sold or transferred is necessary. . . . But it does not follow that actual or physical delivery should always accompany the sale or transfer, and this is also true as to the pledging of choses in action or other kinds of personal property. The delivery in some cases may be symbolical, such as the handing over the writing which constitutes the title to the property, just as was done in this case, to secure the Atlas National Bank \n\n[234 U.S. 399, 410]\n\u00a0\n for the money it had loaned to Stothfang. He delivered to the bank, not the 165 barrels of whisky, but the warehouse receipts for the same, which were its muniment of title and control of the property they represented. And when the pledgeor desired to secure the payment of the note held against him by Dieckmann, he executed and delivered to him the transfer of all interest in the receipts which would remain after the bank's claim should be satisfied. This transfer was not strictly a pledge, but an assignment and transfer of the stated interest in the warehouse receipts; but if it is desired that we call it a pledge, as has been done by counsel, we still observe that constructive possession in the second pledgee would be sufficient, if the intent to deliver such possession is clearly apparent. It is the application of the familiar rule that the transfer is complete and delivery made when the owner has done all that he can do in the premises, and has given such possession to the pledgee or transferee as the nature of the property and its situation will permit. In this case Stothfang owned a valuable equity in the warehouse receipts held by the bank, as their sale afterwards made manifest, and it was such interest in them that could be made the subject of sale and transfer, and even pledge; and certainly Stothfang gave to Dieckmann possession of all interest in and title to the receipts which would remain after the debt due the bank was satisfied. This was all the delivery that could then be made, and it was at least a constructive delivery, and this, we think, meets the demands of the law.'\n We are unable to find in these decisions a recognition of the distinctions insisted upon by counsel for appellants. On the contrary, the supreme court of Ohio clearly recognizes the effectiveness of a symbolical delivery.\n It is evident, also, that that court recognizes the force of a long- continued commercial usage. And this lends peculiar significance to the conceded existence for more \n\n[234 U.S. 399, 411]\n\u00a0\n than forty years of the custom and commercial usage set up by appellee in the amendment to his intervening petition, quoted in the prefatory statement. It is no answer to say that a trade custom or usage should not prevail against clear and unequivocal rules of law. This is a petitio principii. The question under consideration is whether certain portions of the written law are to be given by construction an effect different from that expressed in their language, on the ground that, by authoritative decisions of the supreme court of the state, the asserted policy has been found to be implied in them. Since it seems to us that neither the statutes nor the decisions go to the extent that is claimed for them by appellants, we may refer to the established custom as evidence of what has long been understood as the law; for, as this court held in Gibson v. Stevens, and as the supreme court of Ohio held in Gibson v. Chillicothe State Bank, such usages are to be judicially recognized as a part of the law.\n It results that by the local law the transactions in question as between Rohrer and Pattison, had the effect of transferring to the latter the legal title and right to possession for the purposes of the agreement between them; and we think it is a matter of indifference whether the transaction be called a pledge, or an equitable pledge, or an equitable lien. The substance of the matter is, for present purposes, the same.\n This being so, the superiority of Pattison's right over that of the trustees in bankruptcy is established by the decision of this court in Taney v. Penn Nat. Bank, \n232 U.S. 174\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 288.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDE GALARD DE BRASSAC DE BEARN v. SAFE DEPOSIT & TRUST CO.

R., and of $156,000 of bonds issued by the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis, & Omaha Railway Com- \n\n[233 U.S. 24, 27]\n\u00a0\n pany, a specified amount of the bonds being registered in the name of a minor son and a stated amount being likewise registered in the name of a minor daughter of the complainant. It was averred that the bonds were in a safe deposit box in the vault of the defendant Safe Deposit & Trust Company, 'where your orator, by means of a guardianship proceeding in the orphans' court of Baltimore, which has since been declared illegal and void, was induced to place said bonds, said box being rented and standing recorded on the books of the said Safe Deposit Company in the joint names of Messrs. Alexander Brown & Sons and the American Bonding Company; that for the purposes of such guardianship proceeding your orator had, in the year 1908, been required by the said American Bonding Company as surety on your orator's bond in said guardianship proceeding to agree not to remove the said bonds without the consent of said surety; and had further been required by said surety to consent that said surety and said Alexander Brown & Sons should only have joint access to said bonds and the same for the sole purpose of enabling said Alexander Brown & Sons to remove interest warrants from said bonds during the said guardianship, and forward the same for payment to the city of New York as they became due.\n'That in December, 1909, the court of appeals of Maryland, by a decree founded upon personal jurisdiction over all the parties to said guardianship proceeding, declared the said guardianship and certain releases given by your orator in connection therewith null and void; that by said adjudication, the said suretyship of the said American Bonding Company of Baltimore was extinguished, and that neither said Bonding Company nor said Alexander Brown & Sons have, since said adjudication, had any right of access to or other right or control whatsoever in, over, or as to said safe deposit box and the contents of the same, and said adjudication has setablished the \n\n[233 U.S. 24, 28]\n\u00a0\n lack of jurisdiction over said property on the part of the courts which had so undertaken to deal therewith.\n\n'That your orator is entitled to the immediate possession of the said evidences of debt, to wit, registered bonds, for all purposes, and is in urgent need of them for the purpose of causing said debts to be transferred upon the books of the debtor corporations in the state of New York to the name of your orator, or at his option, of surrendering said bonds to the said corporations respectively in exchange for the issuance to your orator of other evidences of said debts, to take the place of said bonds now so registered, as he would have done in the year 1908 but for the illegal guardianship proceeding already referred to.\n\n'That your orator has been, since the month of October, 1908, and still is, the true lessee of said box, the rental of which has been paid with funds furnished by your orator, and, as above shown, at all times owner of the contents thereof; that said Alexander Brown & Sons have not been and are not in any manner responsible either for said box or for the custody of the contents of the same, or in or for any matter growing out of the arrangement under which said box was rented and said registered bonds placed therein; that as to the American Bonding Company, it has had no connection with or interest in the rental of said box or the custody of the contents of the same except as surety of your orator upon his bond as guardian, which said suretyship was undertaken in the aforesaid illegal guardianship proceeding which has been declared void and set aside.'\n\n After reciting the provisions of a memorandum agreement between the plaintiff and defendant Brown & Sons and the Bonding Company by which the joint access to the box in which the bonds were deposited should be had for the purpose of cutting the coupons from the bonds and turning them over to the complainant, it was averred that neigher the American Bonding Company nor Brown & \n\n[233 U.S. 24, 29]\n\u00a0\n Sons set up any interest antagonistic to the complainant, but that he was unable to get access to the box where the bonds were deposited without a decree authorizing him to do so, and that such a decree was necessary for the protection of Brown & Sons and the Safe Deposit & Trust Company. It was then averred that the defendant sheriff of Baltimore county 'has filed in the superior court of Baltimore, a court of law of the state of Maryland, returns to certain writs of attachment stating that he has seized the aforesaid particular debts under such writs issued out of said court in five suits brought by divers nonresidents of the state of Maryland against your orator upon the ground of your orator's nonresidence in said state, to recover upon divers claims alleged to have arisen out of said state; that the said proceedings of the said defendant sheriff under said writs, purporting under color of the attachment statutes of Maryland and of said writs to seize said debts which are owned by your orator in the state of New York, are illegal and void; that your orator has not been personally served with process in said suits; that said debts have not and cannot be seized under said writs, not being property in the state of Maryland; that the defendant sheriff by his said proceedings under said writs has attempted and is attempting to interfere with said box and its contents, and to encumber your orator's title to said particular debts, and has sought and is seeking to deprive your orator of his property and of the effective control thereof and of the use thereof without due process of law, and to deprive your orator of the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Constitution of the United States, and particularly of  1 of the 14th Amendment thereto; that said superior court of Baltimore city has no personal jurisdiction over your orator, and has not gained jurisdiction over the aforesaid box or its contents, or over the debts owned by your orator in the state of New York, and the said defendant sheriff \n\n[233 U.S. 24, 30]\n\u00a0\n has no lawful authority to impede or seek to impede or hinder your orator in the premises, nor to do any act tending to defeat your orator's control of the said debts or the evidences thereof, or to prevent your orator from securing the relief applied for herein, and which this court has jurisdiction to grant your orator, and that the said unlawful proceedings of the said sheriff, under color of said writs, will, if persisted in, constiture an unlawful interference with the jurisdiction of this court in the premises.'\n The prayer was that the complainant be decreed to be the lessee of the safe deposit box, and entitled to access to the same, and to withdraw the contents, and that the sheriff be enjoined from in any way interfering with the accomplishment of these results.\n The demurrers which were filed to this bill by the respective defendants were based first upon the absence of necessary parties; that is, those in whose behalf the attachments had been issued, as referred to in the bill, and second, because, as the bill discloses that the bonds referred to in the bill were under levy by attachment issued out of the state court, there was no power in the United States court to interfere. The court below rested its decree sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill on both these grounds. In disposing of the latter, the court said:\n'This court may not take anything, be it safe deposit boxes, bonds, evidences of debt, or what not, out of the custody of a state court. The complainant does not question the general rule. He claims that it is not there applicable. He says that while the superior court has jurisdiction to issue writs of nonresident attachment, the things which its officer has sought to attach in this case are not attachable. It follows, he argues, that this court may had must, when property applied to, altogether ignore such void proceedings.\n\n'The court of appeals of Maryland has expressly de- \n\n[233 U.S. 24, 31]\n\u00a0\n cided that a court of equity may not assume to declare such attachments altogether nugatory. De Bearn v. Winans, 115 Md. 139, 80 Atl. 730.\n\n'See also: De Bearn v. Winans, 115 Md. 604, 80 Atl. 1071; De Bearn v. De Bearn, 115 Md. 668, 36 L.R.A.(N.S.) 421, 81 Atl. 223; De Bearn v. De Bearn, 115 Md. 685, 81 Atl. 222.\n\n'It was there decided that such evidences of debt or bonds as are involved in the pending case may be attached in Maryland.\n\n'Neither the superior court of Baltimore city nor this court have any control over the other. If it should be here held that the things in question were not attachable, that court would be under no obligation to subordinate its judgment to that of this court. A conflict of jurisdiction would follow. The rule that one court of concurrent jurisdiction may not attempt to exercise control over anything which has previously come into and still is in the control of the other court is intended to render such unseemly controversies impossible. The facts of this case bring it within both the letter and spirit of that rule.'\n\n After further pointing out that ample remedy would be afforded the complainant by asserting his constitutional rights, if any, in the state court where the attachments were pending, and, if such Federal rights were denied, by prosecuting error to this court, the court observed:\n'Technically, as this is a hearing upon demurrer, this court may not be entitled to take judicial notice of the fact that to all the cases in 111 and 115 Md., cited in this opinion, the complainant was a party. The conclusions herein stated have been reached, therefore, without considering whether the question as to whether a court of equity may interfere with these attachment proceedings, and whether the evidences of debt are, under the circumstances of this case, attachable, have been decided contrary to the contention of the complainant in a case to which he was a party, and which had reference to the very attach- \n\n[233 U.S. 24, 32]\n\u00a0\n ment proceedings which he seeks here to have declared invalid.'\n\n We are not constrained by the limitations which the lower court considered prevented it from taking notice of the judicial proceedings in the courts of Maryland in which the attachments issued. We say this because, as was declared in Bienville Water Supply Co. v. Mobile, \n186 \nU.S. 212, 217\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1132, 1134, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 820: 'We take judicial notice of our own records, and, if not res judicata, we may, on the principle of stare decisis, rightfully examine and consider the decision in the former case as affecting the consideration of this;' and again, as further declared in Dimmick v. Tompkins, \n194 \nU.S. 540, 548\n, 48 S. L. ed. 1110, 1113, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 780: 'The court has the right to examine its own records and take judicial notice thereof in regard to proceedings formerly had therein by one of the parties to the proceedings now before it.' Availing of this power and making reference to the records of this court, it appears that the controversy as to the validity of the attachments with which the appeal before us is concerned has, on three different occasions, been here considered. De Bearn v. De Bearn, \n225 U.S. 695\n, 56 L. ed. 1261, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 834; De Bearn v. De Bearn, \n231 U.S. 741\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 318; De Bearn v. Winans, \n232 U.S. 719\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 601. In the first, an attempt to bring a controversy on the subject have was dismissed because of its prematurity. In the other two cases it appears that at the time the bill in this case was filed, the complainant was engaged in litigating in the courts of the state of Maryland the very grounds of opposition to the attachments which were made the basis of the bill in this case, and that after filing such bill he continued such litigation in the state courts, and when, after a full consideration of his grounds of complaint, both state and Federal, in the court of last resort of Maryland, there were decisions against him, error was prosecuted from this court because of the asserted existence of the Federal rights which were alleged in the bill now before us. The records disclose that in both cases motions to dismiss \n\n[233 U.S. 24, 33]\n\u00a0\n for want of jurisdiction were sustained by per curiam opinions, reference being made in the one case (\n231 U.S. 741\n) to authorities upholding the doctrine that no power to review exists in a case where, although there is a Federal question, the conclusion of the court below rests upon a non- Federal or state ground completely adequate to sustain it, and in the other case (\n232 U.S. 719\n) the motion to dismiss was sustained by authorities to the same effect, and additionally upon authorities establishing the rule that a wholly frivolous and unsubstantial Federal question was not adequate to give jurisdiction.\n Indeed, the record in the case last cited establishes that in that proceeding the appellant filed a pleading in which he expressly set up the pendency of the bill in the United States court which is now before us, and urged the supposed Federal rights upon which the bill was rested as a basis for relief.\n From these considerations it obviously comes to pass that the supposed constitutional questions upon which our right to directly review the action of the court below can alone rest have been already here twice decided to be so wanting in merit as not to afford ground for jurisdiction. It is true that the cases referred to involved the jurisdiction to review the judgments of the court of last resort of the state of Maryland under  237 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 227], but that difference affords no reason for distinguishing this case from the previous cases, since it is impossible to conceive that the assertion of an alleged constitutional right which was decided to be so unsubstantial and frivolous as to afford no ground to review the action of the state court of Maryland concerning the attachments should yet now be held to be of sufficient merit to give jurisdiction to directly review the action of the court below in refusing to interfere with the same attachments. Applying the previous cases, therefore, it plainly follows that we have no jurisdiction on this writ of error, and therefore \n\n[233 U.S. 24, 34]\n\u00a0\n our duty is to dismiss. Before, however, discharging that duty without going into the labyrinth of pleadings, of motions, of supplementary papers, etc., etc., with which this and the previous records before us abound, and by the use of which this case has been taken many times to the court of last resort of Maryland, and is here now for the fourth time, as it is in the 'interest of the Republic that litigation should come to an end,' we pause to say that considering again the whole field, and weighing every Federal right asserted, we see no ground for doubting the correctness of the conclusions which constrained us to hold that the controversies presented in the previous cases were beyond our cognizance. Briefly speaking, it is to be observed that the error which in this and the previous cases underlies all the assumptions of Federal right arises from disregarding the distinction between a controversy as to whether the attachments were authorized by the law of the state and the contention as to the power in the state to have given authority to its courts to issue such attachments. The two are widely different, the one being concerned with what state action has been taken and the other with the power of the state to confer authority to take such action. Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 U.S. 674\n, 42 L. ed. 622, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229. As to the first, there is no room for controversy, since the decisions of the Maryland court of last resort have explicitly declared not only that the attachments were authorized by the state law, but that as the result of the authority to issue them there was imposed upon the state courts the duty under the facts disclosed by the record to exert their authority to the full extent required to protect the rights of the attaching creditors by seeing to it that the property attached, which was in the custody of the court and subject to its control, be not permitted to be removed or taken out of the reach of that authority for the purpose of frustrating the rights arising from the attachments. The second, the question of power of the \n\n[233 U.S. 24, 35]\n\u00a0\n state of Maryland to authorize its courts to perform the duty thus cast upon them, would seem to be free from all possible doubt in view of the following facts: (a) that the coupon bonds were in the state, deposited under the directions of the state court in the exercise of admittedly lawful powers; (b), that in that situation it was impossible to remove them from the state without obtaining the authority of the state courts,- an authority which was unaffected by the fact that the bonds were registered, since they were so registered solely because of the previous action of the state court,-an action which the court of last resort of Maryland decided was no obstacle to the attachments of the bonds, since the effect of the state law empowering the attachments was to impose upon the court the duty of seeing to it that this registry should be removed to the extent necessary to protect the rights of attaching creditors. And the force of these suggestions is illustrated by bearing in mind that the denial of all judicial power by the state over the bonds by way of attachment is asserted by the appellant in a proceeding in which he is the actor, invoking the exertion of the state judicial power for the purpose of enabling him to obtain possession of the bonds and do away with the effect of the previous state decree concerning the deposit and registry of the same.\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDENVER & R G R. CO. v. ARIZONA & C R. CO. OF NEW MEXICO(1914)\nNo. 188\nArgued: April 22, 1914Decided: May 11, 1914\n\n\n\n\n Messrs. E. N. Clark, R. G. Lucas, and Joel F. Vaile for appellant.\n Messrs. T. B. Catron and B. W. Ritter for appellee. \n\n[233 U.S. 601, 602]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill brought by the appellee, a corporation of New Mexico, to restrain the appellant from entering upon and interfering in various ways with its right of way. After a trial the plaintiff (appellee) got a decree, conditioned, as to the portions of the line then occupied by the defendant in the actual operation of its railway, upon the plaintiff's constructing at least 21 miles of railroad, etc., and limited as a whole to five years from the date of the decree. This was affirmed by the supreme court of the territory. 16 N. M. 281, 117 Pac. 730. See 13 N. M. 345, 84 Pac. 1018. There are fifty-eight assignment of error, but the propositions argued fall into narrower compass. They are, that the plaintiff never adopted the line it claims; that there was no appropriation of the land until the plaintiff's location map was filed, after the beginning of this suit; that the plaintiff has lost whatever rights it had by laches and inability to construct its line; that there is no irreparable injury or other ground for equitable relief; and that the plaintiff had adequate remedies under the condemnation statutes and by ejectment. So far as they need discussion we will take these up in turn.\n It is found that the plaintiff adopted the line in question; but it is argued that this finding is shown to be wrong as matter of law by reason of specific facts set forth in findings of the supreme court made, after the delivery of its opinion, in addition to those adopted from the court below. These are that certain small portions of the line between the northern boundary of the state and the town of Farmington are not covered by any order of adoption on the part of the directors shown by the records, and that finding that those portions were adopted is based on the oral testimony of the plaintiff's chief engineer. (We do not stop to notice a slight contra- \n\n[233 U.S. 601, 603]\n\u00a0\n diction in form between different parts of the findings, as the meaning is perfectly clear.) The argument is that adoption by the directors is necessary, which is admitted, and that, as the Complied Laws of 1897,  3832, require the directors to keep a complete record of all proceedings in a special book, such record is the only admissible evidence of the fact. But this is a matter of local practice and the construction of a local statute, as to which we should be slow to disturb the decision of the local court. Nadal v. May, April 20, [\n233 U.S. 447\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611.] The statute does not in terms purport to make the validity of the directors' action dependent upon being recorded. No doubt the record, when made, would be the best evidence, but it being found that no record was made, the admission of secondary evidence is no ground for reversing the decree. Bank of United States v. Dandridge, 12 Wheat. 64, 69, 6 L. ed. 552, 554. In the opinion of the court this question is avoided, but the finding subsequently added, coupled with the finding that the line was adopted, imports the ruling of law that we have supposed.\n The next objection is that the maps of the disputed portion of the road were not filed, as required by  3874, until the day after this suit was begun, and attention is called to  3850, which requires a petition for condemnation to set forth that the company has surveyed the line of its proposed road and made a map thereof, and that it has located its road according to such survey. But by  3874, the company is not required to record its map until 'within a reasonable time its road shall be finally located;' which it is found to have done, and again, we see no sufficient reason for reversing the decision of the local court that a company is entitled to protection as soon as its final location is complete. Wheeling, Bridge & Terminal R. Co. v. Camden Consol. Oil Co. 35 W. Va. 205, 209, 13 S. E. 369.\n Next it is said that the plaintiff has been guilty of laches. But it is found that the defendant, with full knowledge, \n\n[233 U.S. 601, 604]\n\u00a0\n threatened and intended to take and occupy and has crossed and recrossed the plaintiff's location at many points and different grades, with circumstances not necessary to be detailed, and thus has made it impracticable for the plaintiff to proceed. It is found also that in the location and acquisition of its line the plaintiff proceeded with due diligence and in good faith, and that it had expended more than $100,000 in the location and securing rights of way before the beginning of this suit. The defendant has gone ahead since the suit was begun, but, of course, has acquired no new rights by doing so. The objections to equitable jurisdiction do not need separate discussion. The line is found to be the best line between the points, and the plaintiff is entitled to it. It neither is to be forced into a compulsory sale, nor to be remitted to legal or statutory remedies that rightly are thought to be inadequate by the local court.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","53":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDETROIT & MACKINAC R. CO. v. MICHIGAN R R COMMISSION(1914)\nNo. 209\nArgued: December 2, 1914Decided: December 14, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 402, 403]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Fred A. Baker and James McNamara for appellant.\n Mr. Edward S. Clark and Mr. Grant Fellows, Attorney General of Michigan, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a bill brought by the appellant, alleging its railroad to be wholly within the state of Michigan, and subject to the jurisdiction of the Michigan Railroad Commission, to prevent the enforcement of two orders of the commission, respectively reducing certain rates and fixing minimum rates for the transportation of logs. The contention is that the orders take the appellant's property without due process of law, contrary to the 14th \n\n[235 U.S. 402, 404]\n\u00a0\n Amendment. The bill alleges that after the passing of the orders the appellant brought a bill in the state court upon the same ground among others; that the testimony before the commission was introduced with other additional evidence; that, as provided by the Michigan statutes, this further evidence was transmitted to the commission, which did not modify its orders, and that thereafter the orders were sustained and the bill dismissed by the state circuit court, and, on appeal, by the supreme court of Michigan. 171 Mich. 335, 137 N. W. 329. An application for a preliminary injunction in the present cause was heard by three judges, as required by the Judicial Code of March 3, 1911, chap. 231,  266 [36 Stat. at L. 1162, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1243], and on their denying the writ an appeal was taken to this court. The decision below is reported in 203 Fed. 864.\n The ground of the decision below was that the petitioner was concluded by the judgment of the Michigan court; and, of course, if the matter properly can be said to be res judicata, there is an end of the case. The argument against its being so is drawn from Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co. \n211 U.S. 210\n, 53 L. ed. 150, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 67; but the applicability of that decision depends upon whether the state courts, in the hearings before them, were acting in a legislative capacity or simply were fulfilling their ordinary function as courts. In Virginia the state Constitution itself provided for an appeal from an order by the commission to the supreme court of appeals, and gave that body power to substitute such order as, in its opinion, the commission should have made. \n211 U.S. 224\n. It is with regard to an order upon such a preliminary appeal that it is said that even though issuing from a court, it would not be a judicial act or effect an adjudication, conclusive if questioned later in a suit. \n211 U.S. 226\n, 227. But the Constitution of Michigan, art. 4, separates legislative, executive and judicial powers, by the Virginia Constitution to the Virginia by the Virginia Constitution to the Virginia supreme court of \n\n[235 U.S. 402, 405]\n\u00a0\n appeals, that, in the absence of a clear decision by the state court, we should not believe that the legislature attempted to grant or could grant such powers to the courts of Michigan.\n The Michigan statutes, though they may not have a perfectly clear vision of the distinctions developed in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., do not attempt to transgress the limits that the Constitution lays down. The important provisions are that any common carrier or other party in interest dissatisfied with the orders of the commission may bring a suit in the state circuit court in chancery to set aside the order on the ground that the rates fixed are unreasonable, and the court is given power 'to affirm, vacate, or set aside the order . . . in whole or in part, and to make such other order or decree as the courts shall decide to be in accordance with the facts and the law.' If different or additional evidence is introduced, the court, before judgment, is to transmit a copy of it to the commission, and the commission may alter or rescind its order, and is to report its action to the court, and the judgment is to be rendered as though the last action of the commission had been taken at first. Public Acts 1909, No. 300,  26. Taking the two provisions together it seems plain that the words 'such other order or decree' in the first do not embrace a change in the rates fixed, but only such other orders or decrees as are incident to an equity cause. If the order of the commission is to be modified by fixing a new rate, that is to be done upon the new evidence by the commission. This interpretation not only is the natural one upon the face of the statute, but avoids the difficulty that otherwise would arise under the Constitution of the state. It is true that the supreme court in the case cited said that 'the duty of the courts in the premises is not essentially different from that of the commission' (171 Mich. 346), but we agree with the district court of three judges that this must be taken to \n\n[235 U.S. 402, 406]\n\u00a0\n mean only that it is the same in respect of the inquiry, whether the rate is confiscatory or not. That the establishment of rules is a legislative function is recognized in Michigan Teleph. Co. v. St. Joseph, 121 Mich. 502, 506, 47 L.R.A. 87, 80 Am. St. Rep. 520, 80 N. W. 383, and, in the absence of a clear decision to the contrary, we shall assume that the principle applies to rates.\n The distinction between the judicial function of declaring a rate unreasonable and the legislative one of establishing a rate as reasonable is developed in Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Garrett, \n231 U.S. 298\n, 58 L. ed. 229, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 48; San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, \n189 \nU.S. 439, 440\n, 47 S. L. ed. 892, 893, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 571; Re Janvrin, 174 Mass. 514, 47 L.R.A. 319, 55 N. E. 381. And in Bacon v. Rutland R. Co. \n232 U.S. 134\n, 58 L. ed. 538, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 283, it was held that statutory provisions very like those of Michigan, under a Constitution that in like manner separated legislative, executive, and judicial powers, gave only the last to the courts. Of course, when once it is established that the bill in the state court was an ordinary though statutory judicial proceeding, we must assume that the plaintiff was bound to present its whole case.

It was made on August 8, 1908, and duly recorded on December 7 of the same year. Before those dates the brewing company had made a mortgage of its land, brewery, 'and all the buildings, machinery, and appliances thereon erected or to be erected,' and the mortgage had been recorded. There were subsequent mortgages, judgment liens, etc., but they do not need special mention. A bill was brought to foreclose the first mortgage, to which the petitioner was not made a party. A receiver was appointed and a sale ordered and advertised. The petitioner then brought this bill against the various adverse claimants, joining the receiver by leave of court. The statute of West Virginia makes a reservation of title such as the petitioner's 'void as to creditors of, and purchasers without notice from, such buyer' unless a notice of the reservation is recorded as therein required. Code (1906)  3101\n\n\n In Holt v. Henley, \n232 U.S. 637\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 459, the court had to consider a similar question of priority in view of a Virginia statute like that of West Virginia upon which the petitioner relies, and, although in that case the conditional sale had not been recorded, it was held that the vendor was to be preferred. The main question now before us is whether this case is to be decided differently on the ground that the tanks were 'an essential, indispensable part of the completed structure contemplated by the mortgage,'-a question left open in the former decision. \n232 U.S. 641\n. The tanks were essential to the working of the brewery, and after they were installed the opening into the recess in which they stood was bricked up. It may \n\n[233 U.S. 712, 717]\n\u00a0\n be assumed that they became part of the realty as between mortgagor and mortgagee, but that is immaterial in equity, however it may have been at the old common law. The question is not whether they were attached to the soil, but we repeat, whether the fact that they were necessary to the working of the brewery gives a preference to the mortgagee. We see no sufficient ground for that result. This class of need to use property belonging to another is not yet recognized by the law as a sufficient ground for authority to appropriate it. If the owner of the tanks had lent them, it would be an extraordinary proposition that it lost title when they were bricked in. That it contemplated the ultimate passing of title upon an event that did not happen makes its case no worse except so far as by statute recording is made necessary to save its rights. The common law knows no objection to what commonly is called a conditional sale. William W. Bierce v. Hutchins, \n205 \nU.S. 340, 347\n, 348 S., 51 L. ed. 828, 833, 834, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 524.\n The cases to which the possible exception left open in Holt v. Henley applies are principally those in which the property claimed has become so intimately connected with or embodied in that which is subject to the mortgage that to reclaim it would more or less physically disintegrate the property held by the mortgagee; e. g., Porter v. Pittsburg Bessemer Steel Co. \n122 U.S. 267\n, 30 L. ed. 1210, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1206. A man sometimes may lose title without his consent, and it has been held that he loses it even to an innocent converter who has added labor of a value far in excess of that of the original chattel. Wetherbee v. Green, 22 Mich. 311, 7 Am. Rep. 653. When the obvious destination of an article is to be incorporated into a structure in such a way that to remove it would destroy the other work, like bricks or beams in a building, there is still stronger ground for not giving to title an absolute right of way. But unless we give a mystic importance to bolts and screws, the mere knowledge that the chattle will be attached to the freehold is of no im- \n\n[233 U.S. 712, 718]\n\u00a0\n portance, except, perhaps, as against innocent purchasers for value before the sale was recorded, which the mortgagees were not. Holt v. Henley, \n232 \nU.S. 637, 640\n, 641 S., 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 459. The damage that will be done by removal in this case is trifling and the petitioner offers to make it good.\n The West Virginia decisions that had been rendered before the petitioner's contract, was made, like those of Virginia, favored the petitioner's right, Hurxthal v. Hurxthal, 45 W. Va. 584, 32 S. E. 237. We do not understand Lazear v. Ohio Valley Steel Foundry Co. 65 W. va. 105, 63 S. E. 772, to lay down a different doctrine. We take it rather as turning on the special effect of a sale to receivers whose certificates it was thought were backed by a promise of the court that they should constitute a first lien. Therefore, we find it unnecessary to consider whether otherwise the doctrine of Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 U.S. 20\n, 27 L. ed. 359, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 10, coupled with our own opinion that the rule applied in the earlier decision is correct, would require us to follow that rather than the later case.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice Lurton dissents. \n\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDIAMOND COAL & COKE CO. v. U S(1914)\nNo. 192\nArgued: Decided: April 6, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 236, 237]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. F. Kelley, L. O. Evans, and B. M. Ausherman for appellant.\n Solicitor General Davis and Mr. Karl W. Kirchwey for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was a suit by the United States, against an incorporated company engaged in coal mining, to regain the title to about 2,840 acres of land in Uinta county, Wyoming, theretofore patented to Thomas Sneddon and Daniel F. Harrison, and by them conveyed to the coal company. The patents, thirty-four in number, were issued under the homestead law upon what are called soldiers' additional entries. The applications for the entries were made at various dates beginning with May 1, 1899, and each application was accompanied by an affidavit, by either Sneddon or Harrison, stating that he was \n\n[233 U.S. 236, 238]\n\u00a0\n well acquainted with the land, had passed over it frequently, and could testify understandingly about it; that there was not, to his knowledge, any deposit of coal or other valuable mineral within its limits; that it was essentially nonmineral, and that the application was made with the object of securing it for agricultural purposes, and not of fraudulently obtaining title to mineral land. Mineral lands, including coal lands, are not subject to acquisition under the homestead law (Rev. Stat.  2302, 2318, 2319, 2347-2351, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1410, 1423, 1424, 1440, 1441), and these affidavits were made and submitted as proof that the character of the lands applied for was such that they properly could be acquired under that law. The land officers accepted the affidavits and the statements, therein as true, and allowed the entries and issued the patents.\n The bill charged that the affidavits were false and that the entries and patents were procured in the execution of a fraudulent scheme to acquire known coal lands under soldiers' additional homestead entries; and the decisive issues in the case were, first, whether the lands were known to be valuable for coal when the applications for the entries were made, and, second, if they were, whether the coal company was a bona fide purchaser from the patentees. At the hearing the circuit court answered the first of these questions in the negative and gave a decree for the coal company; but upon an appeal to the circuit court of appeals that court answered the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative, and reversed the action of the circuit court, with a direction that a decree for the government be entered. 112 C. C. A. 272, 191 Fed. 786. The present appeal was then taken by the coal company.\n As the arguments of counsel have taken a wide range and in some respects have departed from the settled rules of decision applicable in cases like this, it will be appropriate to restate those rules before turning to the evidence. They are: \n\n[233 U.S. 236, 239]\n\u00a0\n 1. Questions of fact arising in the administration of the public-land laws, such as whether lands sought to be entered are mineral or nonmineral, are committed to the land officers for determination; and as their decision must rest largely or entirely upon proofs outside the official records, it is possible in ex parte proceedings, as was the case here, for applicants, by submitting false proofs, to impose upon those officers and secure entries and patents under one law, when if truthful proofs were submitted the lands could not be acquired under that law, but only under another imposing different restrictions upon their disposal. A patent secured by such fraudulent practices, although not void or open to collateral attack, is nevertheless voidable, and may be annulled in a suit by the government against the patentee or a purchaser with notice of the fraud.

The respect due to a patent, the presumption that all the preceding steps required by law were duly observed, and the obvious necessity for stability in titles resting upon these official instruments, require that in suits to annul them the government shall bear the burden of proof and shall sustain it by that class of evidence which commands respect, and that amount of it which produces conviction.

Rep. 340.\n\n 3. \nTo justify the annulment of a homestead patent as wrongfully covered mineral land, it must appear that at the time of the proceedings which resulted in the patent the land was known to be valuable for minerals; that is to say, it must appear that the known conditions at the time \n\n[233 U.S. 236, 240]\n\u00a0\n of those proceedings were plainly such as to engender the belief that the land contained mineral deposits of such quality and in such quantity as would render their extraction profitable and justify expenditures to that end. If at that time the land was not thus known to be valuable for mineral, subsequent discoveries will not affect the patent. The inquiry must be directed to the situation at that time, as were the applicant's proofs and the finding of the land officers. If the proofs were not false then, they cannot be condemned, nor the good faith of the applicant impugned, by reason of any subsequent change in the conditions. 'We say 'land known at the time to be valuable for its minerals,' as there are vast tracts of public land in which minerals of different kinds are found, but not in such quantity as to justify expenditures in the effort to extract them. It is not to such lands that the term 'mineral' in the sense of the statute is applicable. . . . We also say lands known at the time of their sale to be thus valuable, in order to avoid any possible conclusion against the validity of titles which may be issued for other kinds of land, in which, years afterwards, rich deposits of mineral may be discovered. It is quite possible that lands settled upon as suitable only for agricultural purposes, entered by the settler and patented by the government under the pre-emption laws, may be found, years after the patent has been issued, to contain valuable minerals. Indeed, this has often happened. We therefore use the term known to be valuable at the time of sale, to prevent any doubt being cast upon titles to lands afterwards found to be different in their mineral character from what was supposed when the entry of them was made and the patent issued.'

Rep. 299.\n As a further preliminary to considering the evidence, it should be observed that these lands, if purchased under the coalland law, would have cost $20 an acre, and also that the coal company could not have purchased directly, or indirectly through others, more than 320 acres, unless it expended $5,000 in opening and improving a mine, in which event the maximum would have been 640 acres. Rev. Stat.  2348, 2350, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1440, 1441; United States v. Trinidad Coal & Coping Co. \n137 U.S. 160\n, 34 L. ed. 640, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 57; United States v. Keitel, \n211 U.S. 370\n, 53 L. ed. 230, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 123. As before said, the entries here in question embraced about 2,840 acres.\n Coming to the evidence, we find it voluminous, unreasonably so. Part of it sheds no light upon the issues, and was taken in disregard of the last of the rules just stated. That which properly may be considered very clearly establishes the following facts:\n The proceedings in the land office began in May, 1899. Most of the applications were filed during that year and passed to patent in 1901. The others were presented and acted upon in succeeding years. The patents were all secured by means of affidavits and proofs, as before indicated, declaring that the lands were essentially nonmineral, were not known to contain any deposit of coal, and were sought for agricultural purposes, and not as mineral land. For many years the district in which the lands were situate had been known to contain coal. They were surveyed in 1874, and the surveyor reported one of the sections as coal land, the others being contiguous to lands similarly reported. This was shown in the field notes and upon the official plats. The lands were in a valley, 3 or 4 miles in width, bounded on the east and west by foothills. A thick bed of coal was disclosed in the eastern face of the western hills, but its quality was not such as to make it of commercial value. Along \n\n[233 U.S. 236, 242]\n\u00a0\n the western base of the eastern hills was the outcrop of another coal bed. This outcrop had been weathered down and in some places covered by the wash from above, but it could be traced upon the surface for several miles. It had been opened up at different places, and the openings disclosed a coal bed, from 6 to 14 feet in thickness, dipping to the west at an angle of from 15 to 25 degrees from the horizontal, as did the cretaceous rocks with which it was interstratified. This coal was of superior quality and recognized commercial value, and the rocks containing it were the coal- bearing strata of that region. The lands in controversy were west of the outcrop, in the direction of the dip. Some were near the outcrop, and the east line of the farthest section was about a mile and a half away. There was nothing upon their surface showing the presence of coal beneath, nor anything indicating that the bed outcropping on the east and dipping to the west did not pass through them. Unless valuable for coal, they were not worth to exceed a dollar and a quarter an acre. They were arid sagebrush lands, about 7,000 feet above sea level, and afforded very limited pasturage. Without irrigation they were not susceptible of cultivation, and the cost of securing water for that purpose was prohibitive.\n Attracted by this outcrop, the coal company opened a mine thereon, in the vicinity of these lands, in 1894. In the beginning the output of the mine was small, but it reached 183,750 tons for 1897, 259,608 tons for 1898, and 441,277 tons for 1899.\n An attempt was made by the coal company to acquire a part of the lands in controversy in 1898, by inducing some of its employees and others to make ordinary homestead entries of them under an agreement whereby the company was to bear the expense, compensate the entrymen for the exercise of their homestead rights, and receive the title when perfected. The arrangement was fraudulent \n\n[233 U.S. 236, 243]\n\u00a0\n and in direct violation of the homestead law, independently of the character of the lands. 26 Stat. at L. 1097, chap. 561,  5, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1388. Sneddon was in charge of the attempt. He was acquainted with the lands and all their surroundings and was well informed upon the subject of coal mining. With the aid of a surveyor he identified the subdivisions to be entered, and afterwards selected the men who were to make the entries and directed all that was done, indicating, in that connection, that the lands were coal lands and were to be taken for that reason, and also to prevent another coal concern from getting them. The entries were made in 160-acre tracts, and to give them apparent support cheap cabins were put upon the lands, at the company's expense, but the law was not even colorably complied with in other respects. The next year this plan was abandoned and that of using soldiers' additional rights was adopted. These rights were assignable, and in their exercise no residence, improvement, or cultivation was required. See Rev. Stat.  2306, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1415; Webster v. Luther, \n163 U.S. 331\n, 41 L. ed. 179, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 963. At the company's request the prior entries were relinquished and the entrymen were severaly paid $500 for what they had done, the payment to one being $600. When the relinquishments were filed, Sneddon and Harrison immediately applied to enter the lands with soldiers' additional rights. A few of the relinquished subdivisions were not re- entered, and several tracts not covered by the prior entries were included in the new ones, but all of the latter were made with soldiers' additional rights purchased and supplied by the company, and were made for its benefit. The price paid by the company for these additional rights was from $6 to $13 an acre. After the entries were obtained the lands were conveyed to the company, and Sneddon was paid $1,000 for this service, although otherwise regularly employed by the company at the time.\n In 1898, shortly before the dummy entries were made, \n\n[233 U.S. 236, 244]\n\u00a0\n Sneddon had filed in the land office a sworn declaration of his intention to purchase, under the coal-land law (Rev. Stat.  2347-2349, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1440, 1441), one of the tracts in controversy, which he then described as containing 'a valuable vein of coal.' The tract was about a quarter of a mile from the outcrop. At the time of making the soldiers' additional entries he relinquished the coal filing and included the tract in two of them.\n In 1899, about the time of the additional entries, James Lees purchased from the government, under the coal-land law, and sold to the company for $3,400, a quarter section upon which earlier exploration had disclosed good coal, 8 feet in thickness. This sale was in execution of a prior arrangement, and the price paid to Lees was $200 in excess of that paid to the government. The tract was within a half mile in each of three directions from lands here in controversy.\n As indicative of the weight and importance which men having a practical knowledge of coal mining attached to the outcrop at the time, the government proved by an experienced mine foreman, who had been in charge of large mines, known as the Cumberland, adjacent to a portion of the lands in controversy, that those mines were opened in 1900 by reason of what was found on the outcrop; that there was no precedent drilling of the adjacent lands; and that in advising the opening of the mines he was guided by what an examination of the outcrop in 1889 disclosed. True, he said that he could not take 'a solemn oath' or 'be positive' that unexplored lands in the vicinity of the outcrop and in the direction of the dip contained valuable coal, but his testimony was plainly to the effect that the outcrop, the direction and inclination of the dip, and other conditions in 1899 and 1900, afforded reasonable ground for believing that a considerable territory lying west of the outcrop could be mined profitably. \n\n[233 U.S. 236, 245]\n\u00a0\n There was much expert testimony by geologists concerning the outcrop and other known geological data bearing upon the character of these lands. In the main the witnesses were agreed respecting the existence of these physical indicia, but differed as to the conclusions to be drawn from them; the expert for the government maintaining that they afforded convincing reasons for concluding that the lands were coal lands, and the experts for the coal company controverting that view. But the divergence was not so pronounced as it would seem, for it was partly due to a difference as to what, in legal contemplation, are coal lands.\n The expert for the government proceeded upon the theory that when the known surroundings are such that practical coal men would invest in particular lands for coal mining, or advise others to do so, those lands are to be deemed coal lands, even though coal has not as yet actually been disclosed within their limits. And having in mind the outcropping coal bed, the direction and inclination of its dip, the character of the rocks with which it was interstratified, the quality and thickness of the coal at the outcrop, the proximity of the lands to the outcrop, and the topographical and structural features of the vicinity, he gave it as his opinion that the coal bed extended into and through the lands in question, and that practical coal men would regard the lands as valuable for coal, and invest in them as such. He accordingly pronounced them coal lands within his acceptation of that term. This conclusion had substantial support, not only in the facts already recited, but also in the fact that the company's maps, made three years before the suit was begun, showed that it was intended to project its mining operations westward from the outcrop a mile and a half, and had designated the intervening lands, which included some of those in controversy, as coal lands, and in the further fact that the company had returned lands extending west- \n\n[233 U.S. 236, 246]\n\u00a0\n ward a similar distance, likewise including some now in controversy, as exempt from direct taxation by reason of a local statute substituting an output tax upon coal mines. Laws Wyo. 1903, chap. 81, p. 101. The return for the year in which the maps were made claimed an exemption of substantially six sections, in two tiers of three sections each, although the work of developing the mine (No. 4), as shown by the maps, was still within the east half of the middle section in the eastern tier.\n The experts for the coal company proceeded largely, but not entirely, upon the theory that lands cannot be regarded as coal lands unless coal in quantity and of quality to render its extraction profitable is actually disclosed within their boundaries. One testified that even if a slope were driven from the outcrop to within 5 feet of the vertical boundary of one of the sections in question, and in good coal all the way (a fact proved, but not to be considered here, because in the nature of a discovery subsequent to the entries), it would not show that the section approached was coal land, there being no actual exposure of coal within its limits. And he added that it would be the same if the distance were 3 inches instead of 5 feet, but that 'the moment you cross the line, then it commences to be coal land.' Special emphasis was laid upon the uncertainties incident to coal mining in the cretaceous areas of the West by reason of the occurrence of faults, wants, thinning, and the like; and this, it was said, required that actual exposure of coal within the land, by an outcropping at the surface or an excavation, be accepted as the true and only test. But even such a test was largely discredited by statements that 'a good outcrop at the surface may represent a want below, or a want at the surface may represent a coal below,' and that in following a good discovery a fault or thinning, as well as a want, may be encountered at any moment. It was conceded, however, that the coal horizon-meaning the coal- \n\n[233 U.S. 236, 247]\n\u00a0\n bearing strata shown at the outcrop, but not necessarily the coal-passed through the lands in controversy, and one expert, while declaring that he could not make an affidavit that they were coal lands in the sense of 'strictly containing deposits of coal,' candidly added: 'But I would be prepared to make an affidavit that I believe them to contain coal.' Another, although pronouncing the showing at the outcrop and elsewhere insufficient to render the lands valuable for coal mining, said: 'I am not prepared, personally, to either affirm or deny that this land does or does not contain coal. I contend that it is beyond the capacity of any man to say that something exists or does not exist upon which he has no absolute testimony.'\n It is of some significance that Sneddon-who had long been in the company's service, had been the central figure in the acquisition of these lands, was familar with them and the purpose for which they were sought and acquired, was the company's superintendent when the evidence was taken before the master, and was present during a part, at least, of the time when it was being taken-was not called by the company as a witness, and that statements, declarations, and acts attributed to him and which made against the company were permitted to go undenied and unexplained.\n We think the evidence, rightly considered, shows with the requisite certainty that at the time of the proceedings in the land office the lands were known to be valuable for coal. Otherwise they had only a nominal value, not to exceed $1.25 an acre, and yet easily ten times that amount was voluntarily expended by the company in acquiring them. It was hardly intending to make an aimless or grossly excessive expenditure. It was a practical concern, operated by practical men. It had located a mine upon the outcrop five years before, and in the meantime had proved the wisdom of the undertaking \n\n[233 U.S. 236, 248]\n\u00a0\n by its mining operations. They had disclosed the existence of an extensive bed of valuable coal dipping to the west under the valley, and in that way had supplemented the evidence afforded by the outcrop and its surroundings. Without any doubt these considerations induced the company to believe, and rightly so, that the lands in controversy possessed a value for coal mining greatly in excess of their value for any other purpose. This explains the expenditure and the persistency of the company's efforts to acquire them; and the fact that the earlier effort was obviously fraudulent and unlawful, independently of the character of the lands, serves in no small degree to explain the kindred practices employed in the later effort. In short, the company, without care as to the means, sought and acquired the lands because it regarded them as valuable for coal. Its view and purpose were also reflected by its maps and tax returns. Of course, it was not a bona fide purchaser from Sneddon and Harrison, for they were mere agents representing it as an undisclosed principal.\n An exposure to the eye of coal upon the particular lands was not essential to give them a then present value for coal mining. They were all adjacent to the outcrop and above the plane of the coal-bearing strata dipping under the valley. In alternate evennumbered sections they substantially paralleled the outcrop for 7 miles, and in two places were separated from it by only a few rods. Those to the north were opposite the company's developed mine (No. 4), and those to the south were opposite the tract acquired through Lees, upon which good coal was disclosed. The outcrop, the disclosures in the vicinity, and the geological formation pointed with convincing force to a workable bed of merchantable coal extending under the valley and penetrating these lands. These conditions were open to common observation, and were such as would appeal to practical men, and be relied upon by \n\n[233 U.S. 236, 249]\n\u00a0\n them in making investments for coal mining. They did so appeal to the Cumberland people, as well as this company, both large concerns represented by men of experience, understanding the uncertainties and hazards of the business as well as its rewards. No doubt it has its uncertainties and hazards, but the evidence shows that they are not so pronounced as indicated by the company's experts.\n There is no fixed rule that lands become valuable for coal only through its actual discovery within their boundaries. On the contrary, they may, and often do, become so through adjacent disclosures and other surrounding or external conditions; and when that question arises in cases such as this, any evidence logically relevant to the issue is admissible, due regard being had to the time to which it must relate.\n The case of Colorado Coal & I. Co. v. United States, \n123 U.S. 307\n, 31 L. ed. 182, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 131, relied upon by the coal company, is essentially different from this in that there the court was dealing with a statute excepting from entry lands on which there were 'mines' at the time, a matter particularly noticed in the opinion (p. 328), while here the exception is of 'mineral lands' and 'lands valuable for minerals.' Rev. Stat.  2302, 2318, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1410, 1423.\n It will be perceived that we are not here concerned with a mere outcropping of coal with nothing pointing persuasively to its quality, extent, or value; neither are we considering other minerals whose mode of deposition and situation in the earth are so irregular or otherwise unlike coal as to require that they be dealt with along other lines.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDREW v. THAW(1914)\nNo. 514\nArgued: December 11, 1914Decided: December 21, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 432, 433]\n\u00a0\n Messrs.\n William Travers Jerome, Franklin Kennedy, and James A. Parsons for appellant.\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 432, 434]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. P. C. Knox, William A. Stone, Merrill Shurtleff, and George F. Morris for appellee.\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 432, 438]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an appeal from a final order discharging the appellee on habeas corpus. Thaw was held upon a warrant from the governor of New Hampshire for his extradition to New York, in pursuance of a demand of the governor of the latter state. He was alleged to be a fugitive from justice, and a copy of an indictment found by a New York grand jury accompanied the demand. The indictment alleged that Thaw had been committed to the Matteawan State Hospital for the insane under an order of court reciting that he had been acquitted at his trial upon a former indictment on the ground of insanity, and that his discharge was deemed dangerous to public safety. It then alleged that, being thus confined, he conspired with certain persons to procure his escape from the hospital, and did escape, to the obstruction of justice and of the due administration of the laws. By the New York Penal Law an agreement to commit any act for the perversion or obstruction of justice or of the due administration of the laws is a misdemeanor, if an overt act beside the agreement is done to effect the object. Penal Law,  580, 583.\n In the wide range taken by the argument for the appellee it was suggested, among other things, that it was not a crime for a man confined in an insane asylum to walk out if he could, and that therefore a conspiracy to do it could not stand in any worse case. But that depends on the statute. It is perfectly possible and even may be rational to enact that a conspiracy to accomplish what an individual is free to do shall be a crime. An individual is free to refuse his custom to a shop, but a conspiracy to abstain from giving custom might and in some jurisdictions probably would be punished. If the acts conspired for tend to obstruct the due administration of the laws, the statute makes the conspiracy criminal whether the acts themselves are so or not. We do not regard it as open \n\n[235 U.S. 432, 439]\n\u00a0\n to debate that the withdrawal, by connivance, of a man from an insane asylum, to which he had been committed as Thaw was, did tend to obstruct the due administration of the law. At least, the New York courts may so decide. Therefore the indictment charges a crime. If there is any remote defect in the earlier proceedings by which Thaw was committed, which we are far from intimating, this is not the time and place for that question to be tried.\n If the conspiracy constituted a crime, there is no doubt that Thaw is a fugitive from justice. He was a party to the crime in New York, and afterwards left the state. It long has been established that, for purposes of extradition between the states, it does not matter what motive induced the departure. Roberts v. Reilly, \n116 U.S. 80\n, 29 L. ed. 544, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 291; Appleyard v. Massachusetts, \n203 \nU.S. 222, 226\n, 227 S., 51 L. ed. 161-163, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 122, 7 Ann. Cas. 1073. We perceive no ground whatever for the suggestion that in a case like this there should be a stricter rule.\n The most serious argument on behalf of Thaw is that if he was insane when he contrived his escape, he could not be guilty of crime, while if he was not insane, he was entitled to be discharged; and that his confinement and other facts scattered through the record require us to assume that he was insane. But this is not Thaw's trial. In extradition proceedings, even when, as here, a humane opportunity is afforded to test them upon habeas corpus, the purpose of the writ is not to substitute the judgment of another tribunal upon the facts or the law of the matter to be tried. The Constitution says nothing about habeas corpus in this connection, but peremptorily requires that upon proper demand the person charged shall be delivered up to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime.

The technical sufficiency of the indictment is not open. Munsey v. Clough, 196 U. S. \n\n[235 U.S. 432, 440]\n\u00a0\n 364, 373, 49 L. ed. 515, 517, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 282. And even if it be true that the argument stated offers a nice question, it is a question as to the law of New York which the New York courts must decide. The statute that declares an act done by a lunatic not a crime adds that a person is not excused from criminal liability except upon proof that at the time 'he was laboring under such defect of reason as: 1, not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or 2, not to know that the act was wrong.' Penal Law,  1120. See  34. The inmates of lunatic asylums are largely governed, it has been remarked, by appeal to the same motives that govern other men, and it well might be that a man who was insame and dangerous, nevertheless in many directions understood the nature and quality of his acts as well, and was as open to be affected by the motives of the criminal law as anybody else. How far such considerations shall be taken into account it is for the New York courts to decide, as it is for a New York jury to determine whether, at the moment of the conspiracy, Thaw was insane in such sense as they may be instructed would make the fact a defense. Pierce v. Creecy, \n210 \nU.S. 387, 405\n, 52 S. L. ed. 1113, 1122, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 714; Charlton v. Kelly, \n229 \nU.S. 447, 462\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1274, 1281, 46 L.R.A. (N.S.) 397, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 945. When, as here, the identity of the person, the fact that he is a fugitive from justice, the demand in due form, the indictment by a grand jury for what it and the governor of New York allege to be a crime in that state, and the reasonable possibility that it may be such, all appear, the constitutionally required surrender is not to be interfered with by the summary process of habeas corpus upon speculations as to what ought to be the result of a trial in the place where the Constitution provides for its taking place. We regard it as too clear for lengthy discussion that Thaw should be delivered up at once.\n Final order reversed. \n\n\n\n","57":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEASTERLING LUMBER CO. v.

The power to here review is based on two constitutional grounds seasonably asserted below, assailing two state statutes, the one (chap. 194, Miss. Laws of 1908, p. 204) enacted before the accident, doing away in the cases for which it provided with the principle of fellow servant; and the other (chap. 215, Miss. Laws of 1912), enacted after the happening of the accident, but before the trial below, providing that from the proof of the happening of an accident there should arise a prima facie presumption of negligence.\n The constitutional objection to the first statute is that the classification for which it provided was so unequal as to cause the statute to be in conflict with the 14th \n\n[235 U.S. 380, 382]\n\u00a0\n Amendment. The classification was this: 'Every employee of a railroad corporation, and all other corporations and individuals, using engines, locomotives, or cars of any kind or description whatsoever, propelled by the dangerous agencies of steam, electricity, gas, gasolene, or lever power, and running on tracks, . . .' That the objection is without merit is so clearly established as to require only references to the decided cases to that effect. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The objection to the second statute is that it was wanting in due process because retroactively applied to the case, since the statute was enacted after the accident ocourred. statute was enacted after the accident occurred. statute cut off no substantive defense, but simply provided a rule of evidence controlling the burden of proof. That as thus construed it does not violate the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States is also so conclusively settled as to again require nothing but a reference to the decided cases. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n As it results that at the time the writ of error was sued out it had been conclusively settled by the decisions of this court that both grounds relied upon were devoid of merit, we think the alleged constitutional questions were too frivolous to sustain jurisdiction, and we therefore maintain the motion which has been made to dismiss, and our judgment will be, dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Tullis v.

S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3200), having for its object an injunction against certain alleged combinations of retail lumber dealers, which, it was averred, had entered into a conspiracy to prevent wholesale dealers from selling directly to consumers of lumber. The defendants are various lumber associations composed largely of retail lumber dealers in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, and the officers and directors of the associations. The record is very voluminous, but the facts essential to a consideration of the decree of the district court are in comparatively narrow compass. While the record also concerns practices which are said to have been abandoned, the decree entered, declaring the defendants named to be in a combination or conspiracy to restrict and restrain competition, depends solely upon the method adopted and being used by the defendants in the distribution of the information contained in a certain document known as the 'Official Report,' the form of which, set forth in the decree, is as follows:\n Official Report.\n (Name of the Particular Association Circulating it.)\n Statement to Members (with the Date).\n You are reminded that it is because you are members of our Association and have an interest in common with your fellow members in the information contained in this statement, that they communicate it to you; and that they communicate to you in strictest confidence, and with the understanding that you are to receive it and treat it in the same way.\n The following are reported as having solicited, quoted, or as having sold direct to the consumers:\n (Here follows a list of the names and addresses of various wholesale dealers.) \n\n[234 U.S. 600, 606]\n\u00a0\n Members upon learning of any instance of persons soliciting, quoting, or selling direct to consumers, should at once report same, and in so doing should, if possible, supply the following information:\n The number and initials of car.\n The name of consumer to whom the car is consigned.\n The initials or name of shipper.\n The date of arrival of car.\n The place of delivery.\n The point of origin;\n and the defendants were enjoined from combining, conspiring, or agreeing together to distribute, and from distributing, to members of the associations named or any other person or persons, any information showing soliciting, quotations, or sales and shipments of lumber and lumber products from manufacturers and wholesalers to consumers of or dealers in lumber, and from the preparation and distribution of the lists above described as the 'Official Report,' or the use of a similar device.\n The record discloses that the defendant associations are constituted alrgely of retail lumber dealers, each of whom has the natural desire to control his local trade, which the retailers contend have been unduly interfered with by the wholesalers in selling to consumers within the local territory in such wise as to conflict with what they regard as a strictly local trade, and it appears that the defendant associations have for their object, among other things, the adoption of ways and means to protect such trade and to prevent the wholesale dealers from intruding therein. The particular thing which this case concerns in the retailers' efforts to promote the end in view is the attempt in the manner shown, by the circulation of the reports in question, to keep the wholesalers from selling directly to the local trade. The trade of the wholesalers involved covers a number of states, and there is no question but that the supplying of lumber to the large num- \n\n[234 U.S. 600, 607]\n\u00a0\n bers of retailers in these associations in different states is interstate trade, and that if the practices are illegal within the Sherman act they may be reached by this proceeding. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 U.S. 375\n, 49 L. ed. 518, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 276; Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274, 300\n, 52 S. L. ed. 488, 501, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 301, 13 Ann. Cas. 815.\n The record discloses a systematic circulation among the members of the defendant associations of the official report above quoted. The method of operation as stated by the learned counsel for the appellants is thus summarized in his brief:\n'The names on this list are obtained and placed thereon as the result of complaints made by individual retailers. When an individual member of a retail association learns of a sale by a wholesaler to one of the customers of the retailer he may complain in writing to the secretary of his association, whose duty it is thereupon to ascertain the facts by correspondence with the wholesaler in question and such other means as may seem proper. Should the report or complaint be without proper foundation, or should the secretary become satisfied that the matter is a trifling one, or the result of inadvertence, the incident usually terminates at this point; but should the complaint appear to be serious and well founded, the case is submitted to the board of directors of the retail association at its next meeting, and should the board be satisfied that the wholesaler is generally making a practice of selling to consumers or customers of the retail trade, the secretary is directed to report the name of such wholesaler for the official list. Thereupon the secretary sends the name to Mr. Crary of New York, who adds it upon the next report to the names of those already thereupon. Each report contains the names of all wholesalers who have been reported from the very beginning as selling to consumers, and whose names have not been removed for cause. The reports or lists after being printed in New York are distributed amongst the secretaries of the defendant associa- \n\n[234 U.S. 600, 608]\n\u00a0\n tions; those for each association being marked with its name, and in that way only being distinguished from those sent to the other associations. The secretary of each association then distributes the lists to his members. Should any wholesaler desire to have his name removed from the list he can have it done upon satisfactory assurance to the local secretary that he is no longer selling in competition with the retailers. In practice the greatest care is taken to make the list accurate, and as a matter of fact, it only contains the names of such wholesalers as are absolutely committed to the practice of competing with retailers for the custom of builders and contractors.'\n\n The reading of the official report shows that it is intended to give confidential information to the members of the associations of the names of wholesalers reported as soliciting or selling directly to consumers, members upon learning of any such instances being called upon to promptly report the same, supplying detailed information as to the particulars of the transaction. When viewed in the light of the history of these associations and the conflict in which they were engaged to keep the retail trade to themselves and to prevent wholesalers from interfering with what they regarded as their rights in such trade, there can be but one purpose in giving the information in this form to the members of the retail associations of the names of all wholesalers who, by their attempt to invade the exclusive territory of the retailers, as they regard it, have been guilty of unfair competitive trade. These lists were quite commonly spoken of as blacklists, and when the attention of a retailer was brought to the name of a wholesaler who had acted in this wise it was with the evident purpose that he should know of such conduct and act accordingly. True it is that there is no agreement among the retailers to refrain from dealing with listed wholesalers, nor is there any penalty annexed for the failure so to do; but he is blind indeed who does not see the \n\n[234 U.S. 600, 609]\n\u00a0\n purpose in the predetermined and periodical circulation of this report to put the ban upon wholesale dealers whose names appear in the list of unfair dealers trying by methods obnoxious to the retail dealers to supply the trade which they regard as their own. Indeed, this purpose is practically conceded in the brief of the learned counsel for the appellants:\n'It was and is conceded by defendants, and the court below found, that the circulation of this information would have a natural tendency to cause retailers receiving these reports to withhold patronage from listed concerns. That was, of course, the very object of the defendants in circulating them.'\n\n In other words, the circulation of such information among the hundreds of retailers as to the alleged delinquency of a wholesaler with one of their number had and was intended to have the natural effect of causing such retailers to withhold their patronage from the concern listed.\n The Sherman act has been so frequently and recently before this court as to require no extended discussion now.

It broadly condemns all combinations and conspiracies which restrain the free and natural flow of trade in the channels of interstate commerce. It is true that this court held in the Standard Oil and Tobacco Cases, supra, and in the subsequent cases following them, that in its proper construction the act was not intended to reach normal and usual contracts incident to lawful purposes and intended to \n\n[234 U.S. 600, 610]\n\u00a0\n further legitimate trade, and summarizing the meaning of the act in the Tobacco Case, this court said (\n221 U.S. 179\n):\n'Applying the rule of reason to the construction of the statute, it was held in the Standard Oil Case that as the words 'restraint of trade' at common law and in the law of this country at the time of the adoption of the anti-trust act only embraced acts or contracts or agreements or combinations which operated to the prejudice of the public interests by unduly restricting competition, or unduly obstructing the due course of trade, or which, either because of their inherent nature or effect, or because of the evident purpose of the acts, etc., injuriously restrained trade, that the words as used in the statute were designed to have and did have but a like significance.'\n\n The same principle was affirmed in Nash v. United States, \n229 U.S. 373\n, 57 L. ed. 1232, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 780. The court in the Standard Oil Case construed the act as intended to reach only combinations unduly restrictive of the flow of commerce, or unduly restrictive of competition, and, illustrating what were such undue or unreasonable combinations, it classed as illegal (p. 58) 'all contracts or acts which were unreasonably restrictive of competitive conditions, either from the nature or character of the contract or act, or where the surrounding circumstances were such as to justify the conclusion that they had not been entered into or performed with the legitimate purpose of reasonably forwarding personal interest and developing trade but, on the contrary, were of such a character as to give rise to the inference or presumption that they had been entered into or done with the intent to do wrong to the general public and to limit the right of individuals, thus restraining the free flow of commerce and tending to bring about the evils, such as enhancement of prices, which were considered to be against public policy.' And in Loewe v. Lawlor, supra, this court held that a combination to boy- \n\n[234 U.S. 600, 611]\n\u00a0\n cott the hats of a manufacturer and deter dealers from buying them in order to coerce the manufacturer to a particular course of action with reference to labor organizations, the effect of the combination being to compel third parties and strangers not to engage in a course of trade except upon conditions which the combination imposed, was within the Sherman act. In Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co. \n221 U.S. 418\n, 55 L. ed. 797, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 874, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 492, after citing Loewe v. Lawlor, supra, this court said (p. 438):\n'But the principle announced by the court was general. It [the Sherman act] covered any illegal means by which interstate commerce is restrained, whether by unlawful combinations of capital, or unlawful combinations of labor; and we think also whether the restraint be occasioned by unlawful contracts, trusts, pooling arrangements, blacklists, boycotts, coercion, threats, intimidation, and whether these be made effective, in whole or in part, by acts, words, or printed matter.'\n\n And see W. W. Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 U.S. 38\n, 48 L. ed. 608, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 307.\n These principles are applicable to this situation. Here are wholesale dealers in large number engaged in interstate trade upon whom it is proposed to impose as a condition of carrying on that trade that they shall not sell in such manner that a local retail dealer may regard such sale as an infringement of his exclusive right to trade, upon pain of being reported as an unfair dealer to a large number of other retail dealers associated with the offended dealer, the purpose being to keep the wholesaler from dealing not only with the particular dealer who reports him, but with all others of the class who may be informed of his delinquency. 'Section 1 of the act . . . is not confined to voluntary restraints, as where persons engaged in interstate trade or commerce agree to suppress competition among themselves, but includes as well involuntary restraints, as where persons not so engaged conspire to compel action by others, or to create artificial \n\n[234 U.S. 600, 612]\n\u00a0\n conditions, which necessarily impede or burden the due course of such trade or commerce, or restrict the common liberty to engage therein.' United States v. Patten, \n226 U.S. 541\n, 57 L. ed. 341, 44 L.R.A(N.S.) 325, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 141. This record abounds in instances where the offending dealer was thus reported, the hoped-for effect, unless he discontinued the offending practice, realized, and his trade directly and appreciably impaired.\n But it is said that in order to show a combination or conspiracy within the Sherman act some agreement must be shown under which the concerted action is taken. It is elementary, however, that conspiracies are seldom capable of proof by direct testimony, and may be inferred from the things actually done; and when, in this case, by concerted action the names of wholesalers who were reported as having made sales to consumers were periodically reported to the other members of the associations, the conspiracy to accomplish that which was the natural consequence of such action may be readily inferred.\n The circulation of these reports not only tends to directly restrain the freedom of commerce by preventing the listed dealers from entering into competition with retailers, as was held by the district court, but it directly tends to prevent other retailers who have no personal grievance against him, and with whom he might trade, from so doing, they being deterred solely because of the influence of the report circulated among the members of the associations. In other words, the trade of the wholesaler with strangers was directly affected, not because of any supposed wrong which he had done to them, but because of the grievance of a member of one of the associations, who had reported a wrong to himself, which grievance, when brought to the attention of others, it was hoped would deter them from dealing with the offending party. This practice takes the case out of those normal and usual agreements in aid of trade and commerce which may be found not to be within the act, and puts it within the pro- \n\n[234 U.S. 600, 613]\n\u00a0\n hibited class of undue and unreasonable restraints, such as was the particular subject of condemnation in Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274, 300\n, 52 S. L. ed. 488, 501, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 301, 13 Ann. Cas. 815.\n The argument that the course pursued is necessary to the protection of the retail trade and promotive of the public welfare in providing retail facilities is answered by the fact that Congress, with the right to control the field of interstate commerce, has so legislated as to prevent resort to practices which unduly restrain competition or unduly obstruct the free flow of such commerce, and private choice of means must yield to the national authority thus exerted.

Rep. 50, is cited and relied upon by the appellants. In that case this court sustained, as against an attack under the Sherman law, the legality of an association called the Traders' Live Stock Exchange in Kansas City. An agreement among purchasers of cattle for the purpose of regulating and controlling the local business among themselves had been entered into, and one of the rules provided that the members of the exchange should not deal with any other yard trader unless he was a member of such exchange. It was said (p. 613):\n'There is no evidence that these defendants have in any manner other than by the rules above mentioned hindered or impeded others in shipping, trading, or selling their stock, or that they have in any way interfered with the freedom of access to the stokc yards of any and all other traders and purchasers, or hindered their obtaining the same facilities which were therein afforded by the stock yards company to the show that the above results have flowed we think the evidence does not tend to show that the above results have followed from the adoption and enforcement of the rules and rugulations referred to.' \n\n[234 U.S. 600, 614]\n\u00a0\n As distinguished from this situation the present case shows that the trade of the listed wholesalers is hindered or impeded; that competition is suppressed and the natural flow of commerce interfered with as the direct result of the circulation of the official reports in the manner stated. The case is quite different from the Anderson Case. And see W. W. Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 U.S. 48\n, 48 L. ed. 612, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 307.\n\n A retail dealer has the unquestioned right to stop dealing with a wholesaler for reasons sufficient to himself, and may do so because he thinks such dealer is acting unfairly in trying to undermine his trade. 'But,' as was said by Mr. Justice Lurton, speaking for the court in Grenada Lumber Co. v. Mississippi, \n217 U.S. 433\n, 54 L. ed. 826, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 535, 'when the plaintiffs in error combine and agree that no one of them will trade with any producer or wholesaler who shall sell to a consumer within the trade range of any of them, quite another case is presented. An act harmless when done by one may become a public wrong when done by many acting in concert, for it then takes on the form of a conspiracy, and may be prohibited or punished, if the result be hurtful to the public or to the individual against whom the concerted action is directed.'\n When the retailer goes beyond his personal right, and, conspiring and combining with others of like purpose, seeks to obstruct the free course of interstate trade and commerce and to unduly suppress competition by placing obnoxious wholesale dealers under the coercive influence of a condemnatory report circulated among others, actual or possible customers of the offenders, he exceeds his lawful rights, and such action brings him and those acting with him within the condemnation of the act of Congress and the District Court was right in so holding. It follows that its decree must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","59":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEBERLE v. PEOPLE OF STATE OF MICHIGAN(1914)\nNo. 164\nArgued: Decided: March 23, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 700, 701]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Richard Price for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 700, 702]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Grant Fellows, Attorney General of Michigan, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Michigan local option law of 1889 makes it unlawful to manufacture or sell malt, vinous, spirituous, or intoxicating liquors in any county where a majority of the electors vote in favor of prohibition.\n The provisions of the law, however, do not ( 1) apply to druggists selling such liquors in compliance with the restrictions imposed upon them by the general laws of this state. It was also provided ( 15) that 'nothing in this act shall be so construed as to prohibit the sale of wine for sacramental purposes, nor shall anything herein con- \n\n[232 U.S. 700, 703]\n\u00a0\n tained prohibit druggists from selling pure alcohol for medicinal, art, scientific, and mechanical purposes.' Pub. Acts (Mich.) 1889, pp. 287, 293.\n By amendments passed in 1899 and 1903 (Acts of 1899, p. 280; Acts of 1903, p. 229), it was further provided that the act should not be construed to 'prohibit the sale of wine or cider made from home-grown fruit in quantities of not less than 5 gallons, nor . . . to prohibit the manufacture of wine or cider, nor . . . to prohibit the sale at wholesale of wine or cider manufactured in said [dry] county to parties who reside outside of said county.'\n As a result of an election held April 13, 1909, the law became operative in Jackson county on May 1st, 1909. The defendants, who were officers of a brewing company, were charged with having thereafter manufactured beer in that county, in violation of the statute. They moved to quash the information, upon the ground that the act was void because it interfered with interstate commerce, took property without due process of law, and so discriminated against them and other manufacturers residing in dry counties as to deny them the equal protection of the law. These defenses were overruled. On the trial they offered evidence tending to show that the beer which they had manufactured had not been made for sale, but to be used in causing re-fermentation of 1,600 barrels of beer, worth $ 5 a barrel, which was on hand at the date of the election, with a view of making it salable, and thereby save themselves against loss. Under the charge of the court, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. The case was then taken to the supreme court of Michigan, which held (167 Mich. 477, 133 N. W. 519) that the amendments of 1899 and 1903 (permitting the manufacture and sale of wine and cider in dry counties) were void as an unlawful discrimination against the products and citizens of other states, and \n\n[232 U.S. 700, 704]\n\u00a0\n a violation of the equal protection clause of the Constitution. The court, however, sustained the conviction and sentence of defendants upon the ground that the original local option act was constitutional and had not been rendered invalid by the void amendments of 1899 and 1903. The case was then brought here, where, in addition to the errors previously assigned, the plaintiffs in error-defendants in the trial court-insisted that the court erred in holding that the act could be valid if the amendments relative to wine and cider were stricken-said provisions 'being a part of the act at the time the local option law was adopted in Jackson county, where defendants reside, and operating, together with the other provisions of the act, to bring about such adoption.'\n\n 1. \nThe argument here was principally directed to a discussion of this assignment of error,-the defendants contending that the discriminatory wine-and-cider amendments formed an integral part of the law (Endlich, Statutes,  94, 294) which had been submitted to the voters, and which, when adopted, it was claimed, was adopted as a whole. It was insisted that the provisions permitting the manufacture and sale of wine and cider induced many to vote for the law as amended, and it was, in effect, argued that these amendments could not be treated as a part of the statute for the purpose of carrying the election, and then be held void in order to save the law from being set aside as discriminatory. In support of this contention, defendants relied on State ex rel. Huston v. Perry County, 5 Ohio St. 497, where the court was considering a local option statute, one section of which provided for an election to determine whether a county seat should be removed, and another ( 5) contained unconstitutional provisions which were such 'as would naturally influence the vote upon the adoption or rejection of the main section.' It was held that 'the provisions of both sections are made equally to depend upon \n\n[232 U.S. 700, 705]\n\u00a0\n the result of the election. They were submitted by the legislature collectively to the voters, and could only be passed upon as a whole, and . . . must therefore stand or fall together.' But in that case the valid and invalid provisions formed an inseparable part of a single act which was void as a whole, whether treated as having been adopted by the legislature or the people. On the other hand, in the case at bar the original local option law of 1889 had been held to be constitutional as a whole, and its validity could not be impaired by the subsequent adoption of what were in form amendments, but, in legal effect, were mere nullities.\n\n 2. \nIt is true that the fact that these amendments were on the statute book may have influenced electors. Some may have voted for the law because of the supposed permission to make wine. Others may have opposed its adoption because of the supposed exemption of wine from the operation of the act. But in either event these void amendments were not a part of the law, but extraneous inducements which may or may not have determined the result. The attack, therefore, goes rather to the regularity of the adoption than to the constitutionality of the statute after it had been adopted for Jackson county. But it was for the state court to determine that matter, and to decide whether the election was void because the question apparently submitted was the adoption of the law and amendments, when, in reality, only the law itself was submitted. This court, on writ of error from a state court, cannot inquire into the motives or arguments which influence men to vote for or against a measure. Neither can we reverse the decision of the state court, and declare the act inoperative in Jackson county because the electors thereof may have voted under a misapprehension as to the matter submitted, any more than we could set aside a statute because it had been enacted contrary to parliamentary rules relating to the introduction, debate, and \n\n[232 U.S. 700, 706]\n\u00a0\n passage of a bill. The original local option statute had been held to be constitutional, and prohibited, without discrimination, the manufacture of all liquors. That valid act the defendants violated, and their conviction cannot be set aside on the ground that some or all of the electors voted to make the law operative in Jackson county under the supposition that, as wine could be manufactured, the equal protection clause of the Constitution would make it likewise lawful to manufacture beer and other liquors.\n\n 3. \nNor can the judgment be reversed because the original act, while prohibiting liquor to be sold by merchants, permitted it to be sold by druggists for medicinal, mechanical, or scientific purposes. The contention that this was an unlawful discrimination is answered by Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 U.S. 1\n, 32 L. ed. 346, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 232, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 6; Rippey v. Texas, \n193 U.S. 504\n, 48 L. ed. 767, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 516; Ohio ex rel. Lloyd v. Dollison, \n194 U.S. 447\n, 48 L. ed. 1065, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 703. Those cases show that the state may prohibit the sale of liquor absolutely or conditionally; may prohibit the sale as a beverage, and permit the sale for medicinal and like purpose; that it may prohibit the sale by merchants and permit the sale by licensed druggists.\n\n 4. \nIt was further contended that the act takes property without due process of law because it made no provision for the sale of liquor on hand at the time the law became operative. But the record does not call for a decision of that question, nor does it bring the case within the principle, suggested in Bartemeyer v. Iowa, 18 Wall. 129, 133, 21 L. ed. 929, 930, that a statute absolutely prohibiting the sale of property in existence at the time of the passage of the law would amount to confiscation and be void as depriving the owner of his property without due process of law. The defendants were not charged with selling property which was in their possession when the law went into effect in May, 1909, but with manufacturing beer in September, 1909, several months after its adoption. The fact that such beer may have been made for use in starting re- fermentation of \n\n[232 U.S. 700, 707]\n\u00a0\n other beer that was on hand when the law became operative does not bring the case within the principle for which the decision is cited. For the right to manufacture beer to be utilized in giving value to an unfinished brew is no more protected by the Constitution than the right to manufacture beer in order to utilize the brewery, and thereby preserve the value of the plant as a going concern.\n Liquor laws are enacted by virtue of the police power to protect the health, morals, and welfare of the public. Such laws may operate to depreciate the principal value of distilleries, breweries, and other property, in use and on hand when the law is passed, but it has been held in many cases that such depreciation is not the taking of property prohibited by the Constitution. Boston Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, \n97 U.S. 25\n, 24 L. ed. 989; Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 U.S. 623\n, 31 L. ed. 205, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 273. There is nothing in the record calling for a discussion of the assignment of error relating to interstate commerce. The judgment must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEL PASO BRICK CO. v. MCKNIGHT(1914)\nNo. 185\nArgued: Decided: April 6, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 250, 251]\n\u00a0\n In proceedings brought by McKnight to try the right of possession to conflicting mining locations, it appeared that the defendant, the El Paso Brick Company, was in possession of the Aluminum, International, and Hortense claims, constituting what was known as the Aluminum group of placer mines. It held under locations made prior to January, 1903. In 1905 the company decided to apply for a patent to the land, which embraced about 411 acres. Accordingly, on August 2, 1905, it filed with the register of the land office at Las Cruces, Dona Ana county, New Mexico, an application for a patent, together with an affidavit (executed before an officer residing outside of the mining district) that notice of the application had been posted on the land. These papers were filed with the register, who gave the further notice required by statute. No protest or adverse claim was filed by any person. The Brick Company paid $1,027.50, being the purchase price fixed by Rev. Stat.  2333, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1433, and on October 23, 1905, the land officers allowed an entry on which the receiver issued a final receipt-the material portions of which were as follows:\n United States Land Office at Las Cruces, N. Mexico.\n October 23, 1905\n\n\n Received from the El Paso Brick Company, El Paso, Texas, the sum of Ten hundred and twenty-seven and 50-100 dollars, the same being payment in full for the area embraced in that mining claim known as the 'Alu- \n\n[233 U.S. 250, 252]\n\u00a0\n minum Placer Group' unsurveyed . . . embracing 410.90 acres in the Brickland mining district, in the county of Dona Ana and territory of New Mexico, as shown by the survey thereof.\n $1,027.50. Henry D. Bowman, Receiver.\n The entry and this final receipt prima facie entitled the company to a patent, which, however, was not issued because various parties filed protests with the land commissioner in which it was asserted that the Brick Company's locations were originally void, or if valid, had been forfeited. It was also contended that the company was not entitled to a patent because the affidavit showing the posting of the notice on the land had not been signed before an officer residing within the land district, as provided in Rev. Stat.  2335, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1435, which declares that 'all affidavits required to be made under this chapter [ mining laws] may be verified before any officer authorized to administer oaths within the land district where the claims may be situated.'\n Notice of these protests was given to the Brick Company, which was allowed sixty days within to show cause why the entry should not be canceled. 'In response, numerous affidavits and exhibits designed to overcome the objections were filed on behalf of the company,' among which was a 'supplementary affidavit with reference to such posting and such claim, which was in compliance with the laws of the United States, and was verified before a proper officer.'\n On September 4, 1906, the commissioner ruled that the entry was fatally defective because the original affidavit as to posting had not been executed before an officer residing in the land district. From that ruling the Brick Company appealed.\n There was a hearing before the Assistant Secretary of the Interior, who, on September 9, 1908, rendered a decision (37 Land Dec. 155) in which, after discussing the pro- \n\n[233 U.S. 250, 253]\n\u00a0\n visions of Rev. Stat.  2325, 2335, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1429, 1435, and quoting from various rulings of the Land Department and courts, he held that the fact that the affidavit of posting had been signed before an officer residing outside of the district was a fatal defect, which invalidated the entire proceeding. Among other things, he said: 'The defect is not a mere irregularity which may be cured by the subsequent filing of a properly verified affidavit. The statutory provisions involved are mandatory. Their observance is among the essentials to the jurisdiction of the local officers to entertain the patent proceedings. The requisite statutory proof as to posting, not having been theretofore filed, the register was without authority to direct the publication of the notice or otherwise proceed, and the notice, although in fact published and posted, being without the necessary legal basis, was a nullity and ineffectual for any purpose. The patent proceedings, therefore, fall and the entry will be canceled.'\n The record further recites that on November 24, 1908, the Brick Company waived its right to petition for a review of such decision and 'thereupon such decision and the cancelation of said entry became final and said entry was canceled on the records of the land office.' On the next day, November 25, 1908, the Brick Company filed at the local land office a second application for patent. McKnight thereupon filed an adverse claim in which he set up that the land described in the Brick Company's application embraced within its limits the Lulu and Agnes claims which had been located by him in April, 1905, and relocated in May, 1906, at which time he also located the Tip Top, Lynch, and Aurora claims. The patent proceedings in the local land office were stayed in order that McKnight might, as provided in Rev. Stat.  2326, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1430, bring a suit in a court of competent jurisdiction to try the right of possession.\n On January 2, 1909, McKnight brought such suit in the \n\n[233 U.S. 250, 254]\n\u00a0\n district court of Dona Ana county, New Mexico. It was tried November 8, 1909, before a judge without a jury. At the hearing McKnight introduced the certificates of the locations described in his complaint, and evidence tending to show that he had done the required assessment work on his five claims. In support of his contention that the Brick Company had forfeited its rights, by failing to do the annual assessment work, the record recites that he offered 'certified copies of proof filed by the Brick Company in June, 1905, and December, 1906, for the purpose of showing, in connection with the testimony of the witness [the keeper of the county records] that there had been no satisfactory proof of labor filed for any year previous to 1906.' These certified copies consisted of affidavits by the president of the Brick Company that it had done more than $5,000 worth of work on its locations during each of the years 1903, 1904, and 1906. There was no ruling by the court limiting the effect of the affidavits as evidence, but it appears that McKnight contended that, as the names of the persons actually doing the work were not stated in the affidavit, and as the first of the affidavits was made in April, 1905, the burden of showing that the work had actually been done for 1903 and 1904 was cast on the Brick Company by virtue of the provisions of  2315 of the Compiled Laws of New Mexico. The Brick Company, on\n'Sec. 2315. The owner or owners of any unpatented mining claim in this territory, located under the laws of the United States and of this territory, shall, within sixty days from and after the time within which the assessment work required by law to be done upon such claim should have been done and performed, cause to be filed with the recorder of the county in which such mining claim is situated, an affidavit setting forth the time when such work was done, and the amount, character, and actual cost thereof, together with the name or names of the person or persons who performed such work; and such affidavit, when made and filed as herein provided, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. The failure to make and file such affidavit as herein provided shall in any contest, suit, or proceedings touching the title to such claim, throw the burden of proof upon the owner or owners of such claim to show that such work has been done according to law.' \n\n[233 U.S. 250, 255]\n\u00a0\n the other hand, appears to have contended that this territorial statute was not only void as being in conflict with the Federal statutes, but that the affidavits offered by plaintiff showed on their face that many times the amount of assessment work required had been done in 1903, 1904, and 1906, thus segregating the land from the public domain and rendering McKnight's subsequent locations nugatory.\n\n At the conclusion of the evidence the court took the case under advisement, and on December 17, 1909, rendered a judgment for McKnight which was affirmed (16 N. M. 721, -- L.R.A.(N.S.) --, 120 Pac. 694, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 1309) by the supreme court of New Mexico. The case was then brought here on appeal.\n Messrs. Francis W. Clements, Evans Browne, Alexander Britton, Aldis B. Browne, W. A. Hawkins, and John Franklin for appellant.\n Mr. Eugene S. Ives for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Lamar:\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n McKnight brought suit against the El Paso Brick Company to try the right of possession to conflicting mining locations. In his complaint he asserted his own title and attacked that of the defendant under locations older in date, but which he claimed had been forfeited by failure to do the annual assessment work for 1903 and 1904, thereby leaving the land open to the locations made by McKnight in 1905 and 1906. The Brick Company, while insisting that the plaintiff's own evidence proved that the assess- \n\n[233 U.S. 250, 256]\n\u00a0\n ment work had in fact been fully performed, relied on the legal effect of the company's application for a patent to the land and the final receipt issued to it by the receiver of the local land office in October, 1905. To this the plaintiff replied that the entry, on which the receipt issued, had been canceled on the ground that the patent proceedings were absolutely void because the statutory affidavit of posting had not been filed.\n\n 1. \nLocators of mining claims have the exclusive right of possession of all the surface included within the exterior limits of their claims so long they make the improvements or do the annual assessment work required by the Revised Statutes,  2324, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1426. The law, however, provides (Rev. Stat.  2325, 2333, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1429, 1433) a means by which the locator can pay the purchase price fixed by statute and convert the defeasible possessory title into a fee simple. Sixty days' notice must be given in order that all persons having any adverse claim may be heard in opposition to the issue of a patent. That notice is threefold. It must be given by publication in the nearest newspaper, by posting in the Land Office, and by posting on the land itself; and it is provided in the statute that this latter fact may be proved by the affidavit of two persons before an officer residing within the land district (Rev. Stat.  2335). All persons having adverse claims under the mining laws may be heard in objection to the issuance of a patent. But ( 2325) 'if no adverse claim shall have been filed . . . it shall be assumed that the applicant is entitled to a patent upon the payment . . . [of the price fixed by statute] and that no adverse claim exists; and thereafter no objection from third persons to the issuance of a patent shall be heard, except it be shown that the applicant has failed to comply with the terms of this chapter' [relating to mineral lands].\n\n 2. \nIn the present case the Brick Company's application for a patent was filed, each of the several forms of notice \n\n[233 U.S. 250, 257]\n\u00a0\n required by statute was given, no adverse claim was filed, the purchase price was paid to the government, and a final receipt was issued by the local land office. The entry by the local land officer issuing the final receipt was in the nature of a judgment in rem (Wight v. Dubois, 21 Fed. 693), and determined that the Brick Company's original locations were valid, and that everything necessary to keep them in force, including the annual assessment work, had been done. It also adjudicated that no adverse claim existed and that the Brick Company was entitled to a patent.\n From that date, and until the entry was lawfully canceled, the Brick Company was in possession under an equitable title, and to be treated as 'though the patent had been delivered to' it. Dahl v. Raunheim, \n132 U.S. 262\n, 33 L. ed. 325, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 74, 16 Mor. Min. Rep. 214. And, when McKnight instituted possessory proceedings against the Brick Company, the latter was entitled to a judgment in its favor when it produced that final receipt as proof that it was entitled to a patent and to the corresponding right of an owner.\n Nor should the result have been different when the record showed that the entry and final receipt, properly issued, had been improperly canceled. It is true that the order of the Department was a denial of the patent, but it was not a conclusive adjudication that the Brick Company was not entitled to a patent, nor could such an order deprive the Brick Company of rights vested in it by law. For while the General Land Office had power of supervision over the acts of the local officers, and could annul entries obtained by fraud or made without authority of law, yet, if the Department's cancelation was based upon a mistake of law, its ruling was subject to judicial review when properly drawn in question in judicial proceedings, inasmuch as the power of the land office is not unlimited, nor can it be arbitrarily exercised so as to deprive any person of land lawfully entered and paid for. Cornelius v. \n\n[233 U.S. 250, 258]\n\u00a0\n Kessel, \n128 U.S. 461\n, 32 L. ed. 483, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 122; Parsons v. Venzke, \n164 U.S. 89\n, 41 L. ed. 360, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 27.\n\n 3. \nSo that the case involves a determination of the single question as to whether the patent was properly refused by the Land Department because of the objection that the Brick Company had failed to comply with the terms of the law relating to mineral land. Rev. Stat.  2325, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1429. That can be determined by an inspection of the record, in which the order appears. It shows that the cancelation of the entry was not based on the Brick Company's failure to do the annual assessment work, or to give the proper notice, or to pay the statutory price, but solely for the reason that the affidavit of posting was executed before an officer who resided outside of the land district.\n That decision (37 Land Dec. 155), though supported by some Departmental rulings of comparatively recent date, was in conflict with the established practice of the Land Department, and was expressly and by name overruled, on July 29, 1911, in Re Stock Oil Co. 40 Land Dec. 198, which reaffirmed prior decisions to the effect that irregularities in proof, including the execution of affidavits before other than the designated officers, might be supplied, even on appeal.\n These and similar rulings, previously followed in the Department, are manifestly correct. They accord with the policy of the land laws, under which the United States does not act as an ordinary proprietor seeking to sell real estate at the highest possible price, but offers it on liberal terms to encourage the citizen and to develop the country. The government does not deal at arm's length with the settler or locator, and whenever it appears that there has been a compliance with the substantial requirements of the law, irregularities are waived or permission is given, even on appeal, to cure them by supplemental proofs. United States v. Marshall Silver Min. Co. \n129 U.S. 587\n, 32 L. ed. 737, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 343, 16 Mor. Min. Rep. 205. In \n\n[233 U.S. 250, 259]\n\u00a0\n the present case such proof by supplemental affidavits, properly executed, showed that the land had been properly posted. But that fact was not allowed to have any effect because of the mistaken view that, as the original affidavit of posting had been signed before an officer residing outside of the land district, the patent proceedings were absolutely void. This confused service by proper posting-which was judisdictional,-with defective proof of such service, which-like the defective return of an officer-could be corrected. Under the law, jurisdiction depended upon giving notice by publication in a newspaper, by posting in the land office, and by posting on the land itself,-the statute directing how the giving of such notice should be proved. But irregularities in complying with such directory provision could be cured, and when cured, as it was here, the patent should have been issued. The cancelation of the entry was based on a plain error of law, and though there was no appeal in fact, and no right of appeal to the courts, the ruling did not operate to deprive the Brick Company of its property in the mines. The fact that the Brick Company, perforce, yielded to the erroneous ruling, and instituted new proceedings in order to secure a patent, as evidence of its title, did not destroy the rights with which the company had become invested by full compliance with the requirements of Rev. Stat.  2325, U. S. Comp. Stat, 1901, p. 1429. When, therefore, in the suit to try the right of possession, the plaintiff asked that proper effect be given to the final receipt and the entry on which it was based as a judgment in rem, it was not making, as is contended, a collateral attack on the order of the Land Department, but was merely relying on the valid entry, and asking the court to decline to give effect to the erroneous cancelation.\n\n 4. \nThis conclusion makes it unnecessary to decide the question as to whether the territorial statute, imposing upon the locator the burden of proving that he has performed the annual assessment work, is void as being in \n\n[233 U.S. 250, 260]\n\u00a0\n conflict with the Federal statutes, which require no such annual, proof, raise no presumption of abandonment, and, as construed in Hammer v. Garfield, Min. & Mill. Co. \n130 U.S. 291\n, 32 L. ed. 964, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 548, 16 Mor. Min. Rep. 125, demand clear and convincing proof that work has not been done before a forfeiture can be declared. It also makes it unnecessary to determine whether the affidavit of work being offered for one purpose by McKnight could be used for another purpose by the Brick Company as substantive evidence in the case.\n Many pages of the briefs are devoted to a discussion of these questions, but if any of them were decided in favor of the Brick Company it could not increase its rights. If the legal propositions involved could be decided in favor of McKnight, that could not overcome the fact that the issuance of the final receipt to the Brick Company on October 23, 1905, was an adjudication not only that the Brick company was entitled to a patent, but that McKnight then had no adverse claim to the land. Of course he acquired none in May, 1906, by locating on property that had previously been and then was segregated from the public domain.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of the Territory of New Mexico is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Supreme Court of the State of New Mexico for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nENNIS WATERWORKS v. CITY OF ENNIS(1914)\nNo. 305\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1914\n\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 652, 653]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. G. C. Groce and Jack Beall for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 652, 654]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Rhodes S. Baker for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n In March, 1909, the city of Ennis passed an ordinance which purported to be a contract with A. M. Morrison, the owner of a waterworks system in the city, granting to him for the term of thirty years the privilege of supplying water to the city and its inhabitants from certain lakes or reservoirs owned by the city. Morrison accepted the ordinance and assigned his rights to the Ennis Water Works, the plaintiff in error. In April 1909, the city passed an ordinance declaring that Morrison and the Ennis Water Works had derived no rights from the supposed contract made with them because the ordinance pur- \n\n[233 U.S. 652, 655]\n\u00a0\n porting to confer such rights was originally void, and directing suit to be brought 'to adjudicate the nullity of said claim of franchise and to regain for the city its rights in the premises.' Suit was then brought to have it decreed that the alleged contract with Morrison was void. Pending the suit, and before its decision, in March, 1910, for reasons which the record does not disclose, another ordinance in terms like the previous one was adopted by the city, which was brought into the case by an amendment to the bill. A judgment in favor of the city was affirmed by the court of civil appeals and by the supreme court (105 Tex. 63, 144 S. W. 930). This writ of error is prosecuted upon the assumption that the original ordinance was a contract, and that the decree below gave effect to the subsequent ordinances, thus impairing the obligation of the contract, in violation of the Constitution of the United States.\n At the outset our jurisdiction is challenged upon three grounds: 1. Because, even under the assumption that the city ordinances were the sole authority for bringing the suit, those ordinances did not purport in any way to impair the contract if one existed, but simply directed a legal test to be made, and therefore there was no subsequent act of impairment. 2. That even if the ordinances could be tracted as impairing the supposed contract, the court below did not decide the case upon any theory that there was power to impair the contract if one existed, but exclusively rested its action upon the independent ground that the original ordinance, at the time of its adoption, was repugnant to the state Constitution, and was therefore void. 3. That even if it be the duty of this court to determine for itself whether the state court rightly concluded that there was originally no contract, nevertheless there is no jurisdiction in this case because the court below, in deciding that there was originally no contract, based its action upon a rule of state law which had been so conclu- \n\n[233 U.S. 652, 656]\n\u00a0\n sively determined at the time the alleged ordinance relied on as a contract was adopted, that the assertion that there is a contract right is of so frivolous and unsubstantial a character as to afford no basis for jurisdiction.\n The face of the record so clearly manifests the correctness of the third proposition that we pass at once to its consideration. It is apparent on the face of the opinion of the court below that it did not at all rest its conclusion upon original reasoning concerning the asserted contract, but only applied to the decision of that question a doctrine which, long prior to the adoption of the ordinance relied on as a contract, had been announced by the court of last resort of Texas in Brenham v. Brenham Water Co. 67 Tex. 542, 4 S. W. 143, decided in 1887, in which case there was involved a city ordinance which was substantially identical with the one which is here under consideration. Nothing could more conclusively demonstrate this view than does the following excerpt from the opinion of the court below:\n'If this court is to adhere to the holding in the Brenham Case, then we are forced to the conclusion that the judgment of the court of civil appeals should be affirmed, for there is no possible theory upon which this case can be distinguished from the Brenham Case. This statement will receive verification by a comparison of the two contracts as set out in the opinions in the two contracts\n\n After pointing out that the doctrine of the Brenham Case was consecrated by other decisions which had followed it, and that the principle of interpretation which it applied could not be said to be clearly erroneous, the court said:\n'However, we do not feel called upon to enter into any further discussion of the subject of the nature of the contract in this case, as it has been construed by the Brenham Case, which authority has stood the acknowledged law \n\n[233 U.S. 652, 657]\n\u00a0\n of this state for twenty-five years. At the time the contract in the case at bar was entered into the Brenham Case had been promulgated for over thirteen years, and had been approved by all the cases theretofore cited. It had placed upon a similar contract a rule of construction and announced the general policy of the law of this state, that was well known to its general people. No rights could have innocently accrued to the plaintiff in error demanding a change of the law to meet a great and imperative necessity. If a harsh rule of construction had been announced, it was not placed under a bushel, but set upon a hill. Such contract had been declared repugnant to the Constitution, and the provisions of that instrument declaring monopolies and perpetuities contrary to the the genius of a free government had received a definite construction.'\n\n It is insisted, however, that since it is our duty when the assertion is made that contract rights are impaired to determine for ourselves whether or not there was a valid contract, we must hence now determine this controversy by resort to original reasoning without regard to the action of the court below in applying the state rule. But while the premise upon which this contention rests is well founded, the error lies in the deduction which seeks to make it applicable to this case. This is clearly the case, since the doctrine which the premise embodies is subject to this qualification, that where a contract which is relied upon arises from a state law or municipal ordinance having the effect of such law, in interpreting for itself such law or ordinance this court will not give to it a meaning in conflict with the settled rule of the state at the time the law was enacted or the ordinance adopted. In other words, that where we come to consider a contract arising from a state law or ordinance, we will treat it as if there was embodied in their text the settled rule of law which existed in the state at the time the state action relied upon as a \n\n[233 U.S. 652, 658]\n\u00a0\n contract was taken.

Jones, \n193 \nU.S. 532, 548\n, 48 S. L. ed. 778, 787, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 576.\n As by the application of this settled rule the absolute want of foundation for the asserted claim of Federal right appears on the face of the ordinance relied upon, it follows that there was no foundation whatever for the theory upon which the jurisdiction of this court was invoked, and hence it is our duty to dismiss the cause for want of jurisdiction because of the absolutely unsubstantial and frivolous character of the Federal right relied upon.\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEQUITABLE SURETY CO. v. U S, TO USE OF W MCMILLAN & SON(1914)\nNo. 861\nArgued: April 15, 1914Decided: June 8, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 448, 449]\n\u00a0\n The court of appeals of the District of Columbia certifies that the record in the above-entitled cause, now pending in said court upon appeal from the supreme court of the District of Columbia, discloses the following:\n The declaration of the United States to the use of W. McMillan & Son, filed February 11, 1913, against the Equitable Surety Company, alleges:\n That Allen T. Howison, as principal, and the Equitable Surety Company, as surety, on July 24, 1911, executed a bond to the United States in the penal sum of $110,350, conditioned for the faithful performance by Howison of a certain contract made by him with the commissioners of the District of Columbia on that date. A copy of the bond, made an exhibit, shows that the contract was for the erection of a school building fronting on Eleventh street, N. W., between Harvard and Girard streets, in the city of Washington. The conditions of the bond are that if Howison shall perform to the satisfaction of the commissioners the work to be done by him in accordance with the stipulations of the contract, and shall save harmless and indemnify the District of Columbia from any and all claims, delays, suits, charges, damages, judgments, etc., on account of any accidents to persons or property after the commencement of the work and prior to completion and acceptance, and pay the same; and 'will promptly make payments to all persons supplying him \n\n[234 U.S. 448, 450]\n\u00a0\n with labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract,' etc., the obligation shall be void; otherwise to remain in force.\n That thereafter W. McMillan & Son, at the request of the Butt-Chapple Stone Company, agreed to furnish to said contractor certain stone materials to be used in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract by the contractor, and did furnish to said contractor materials of the kind and quality specified in his contract to the value of $4,452. 84, of which material the contractor used on the building a quantity of the value of $3,952.84, for which he has failed to make payment. And that defendant, though requested so to do, has refused to pay the same. The affidavit of the plaintiff in support of the declaration follows the requirements of rule 73.\n After the general issue, defendant filed a special plea denying liability on said bond because, after the execution and delivery of the same, and without the knowledge or consent of defendant, the commissioners of the District of Columbia and the said Howison, its principal, altered the contract the performance of which was guaranteed by said bond. That said alteration consisted in the entire changing of the building from one fronting on Eleventh street to one fronting on Harvard street, which alteration involved the contractor in considerable expense not contemplated in the original contract, and prejudicial to defendant. That said relocation of the building necessitated a material change in grading the ground. That prior to the change of location the contractor had graded the ground as required in the contract, and expended therein the sum of $2, 393.90. And that by reason of the change said sum was a total loss to the contractor, and the further excavation made necessary by the change of location was done at a cost of $1,300.90.\n The affidavit of defense alleged the said change in the contract without its knowledge or consent; and that the \n\n[234 U.S. 448, 451]\n\u00a0\n same necessitated a material change in the grading of the land, which had been previously performed by the contractor, at a considerable expenditure not contemplated in the original contract, and prejudicial to the defendant.\n On motion under the 73d rule of the supreme court of the District of Columbia, the court entered judgment for the plaintiff for the amount of the demand; and defendant has appealed therefrom.\n By stipulation two other cases involving the same question here presented are to abide the result of this case.\n The act of Congress, in compliance with the requirements of which the aforesaid bond was executed (30 Stat. at L. 906, chap. 218), reads as follows:\n An Act Relative to the Payment of Claims for Material and Labor Furnished for District of Columbia Buildings.\n Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That hereafter any person or persons entering into a formal contract with the District of Columbia for the construction of any public building, or the prosecution and completion of any public work, or for repairs upon any public building or public work, shall be required, before commencing such work, to execute the usual penal bond, with good and sufficient sureties, with the additional obligations that such contractor or contractors shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying him or them labor and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract; and any person or persons making application therefor and furnishing affidavit to the department under the direction of which said work is being or has been prosecuted that labor or materials for the prosecution of such work has been supplied by him or them, and payment for which has not been made, shall be furnished with a certified copy of said contract and bond, upon which said person or persons supplying such labor and materials shall have a right of action, and shall be authorized to \n\n[234 U.S. 448, 452]\n\u00a0\n bring suit in the name of the District of Columbia or the United States, for his or their use and benefit, against said contractor and sureties, and to prosecute the same to final judgment and execution: Provided, That such action and its prosecution shall not involve the District of Columbia or the United States in any expense: Provided, That in such case the court in which such action is brought is authorized to require proper security for costs in case judgment is for the defendant.\n Approved, February 28, 1899\n\n\n The court of appeals further certifies that the following question of law arises upon the record; that its decision is necessary to the proper disposition of the cause; and, to the end that a correct result may be reached, desires the instruction of the Supreme Court of the United States upon that question, to wit:\n Did the alteration of the terms of the contract by the District of Columbia and the contractor, without the knowledge or consent of the surety, have the effect to release the surety from the obligation of the bond?\n\n\n Messrs. J. J. Darlington, Joseph A. Burkart, and William E. Ambrose for the Equitable Surety Company. \n\n[234 U.S. 448, 453]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wharton E. Lester, Lucas P. Loving, and Daniel W. Baker for the United States to the use of W. McMillan & Son.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Pitney: \n\n[234 U.S. 448, 454]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice Pitney, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The act of February 28, 1899 (30 Stat. at L. 906, chap. 218), under which the bond in question was given, was modeled after an act of August 13, 1894, entitled, 'An Act for the Protection of Persons Furnishing Materials and Labor for the Construction of Public Works' (28 Stat. at L. 278, chap. 280, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2523). In an action founded upon a bond given under the latter act, it was held by the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit, in United States use of Anniston Pipe & Foundry Co. v. National Surety Co. 34 C. C. A. 526, 92 Fed. 549, 551, that the obligation has a dual aspect, it being given, in the first place, to secure to the government the faithful performance of all obligations which a contractor may assume towards it; and, in the second place, to protect third persons from whom the contractor may obtain materials or labor; and that these two agreements are as distinct as if contained in separate instruments. It was consequently held that the sureties in such a bond could not claim exemption from liability to persons who had supplied labor or materials to their principal, to enable him to execute his contract with the United States, simply because the government and the \n\n[234 U.S. 448, 455]\n\u00a0\n contractor, without the surety's knowledge, had made changes in the contract subsequent to the execution of the bond, the changes being such as did not alter the general character of the work contemplated by the contract, or the general character of the materials necessary for its execution.\n In support of this decision several cases from the state courts were cited, among them Dewey v. State, 91 Ind. 173, 185; Conn. v. State, 125 Ind. 514, 518, 25 N. E. 443; Steffes v. Lemke, 40 Minn. 27, 29, 41 N. W. 302; and Doll v. Crume, 41 Neb. 655, 660, 59 N. W. 806. They fairly sustain the conclusion reached. The cases cited from the Indiana and Minnesota reports antedated the passage of the act of 1894, and may have furnished the suggestion for that enactment.\n The decision of the circuit court of appeals in United States ex rel. Anniston Pipe & Foundry Co. v. National Surety Co. supra, although never until now brought under the review of this court, has been many times cited and followed in the other Federal courts.

Golden Pressed & Fire Brick Co. ( United States Fidelity & G. Co. v. United States) \n191 U.S. 416\n, 48 L. ed. 242, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 142; and United States use of Hill v. American Surety Co. \n200 \nU.S. 197, 203\n, 50 S. L. ed. 437, 440, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 168, this court adopted a reasonably liberal construction of the act of 1894, in view of the fact that it was evidently designed to furnish the obligation of a bond as a substitute for the security which might otherwise be obtained by attaching a lien to the property; such lien not being permissible in the case of a government work. \n\n[234 U.S. 448, 456]\n\u00a0\n It seems to us that the construction given to that act in the case in 92 Fed. is correct, and that it applies equally to the act of 1899, now under consideration; and that this act, like the other, should receive a reasonably liberal interpretation in aid of the public object whose accomplishment is so evidently intended. Its title is, 'An Act Relative to the Payment of Claims for Material and Labor Furnished for District of Columbia Buildings.' The enacting clause, as well as the title, shows that Congress recognized that no legislation was necessary in order to enable the commissioners of the District to require 'the usual penal bond, with good and sufficient sureties,' from a contractor engaged for the construction of a public building. The object of the legislation was to give legal sanction to the 'additional obligation that such contractor or contractors shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying him or them labor and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract,' and to give to such a laborer or materialman the right to bring an action, if necessary, upon the bond, either in the name of the District of Columbia or of the United States, for his own benefit, against the contractor and sureties. The nominal obligee is, with respect to these third parties, a mere trustee, and the obligors, including the surety as well as the principal contractor, enter into the obligation in full view of this. The public is concerned not merely because laborers and materialmen (being without the benefit of a mechanics' lien in the case of public buildings) would otherwise be subject to great losses at the hands of insolvent or dishonest contractors, but also because the security afforded by the bond has a substantial tendency to lower the prices at which labor and material will be furnished, because of the assurance that the claims will be paid.\n Stress is placed by counsel for the surety company upon the fact that the building was materially altered, and in a \n\n[234 U.S. 448, 457]\n\u00a0\n manner that involved the contractor in considerable expense not contemplated in the original contract. If these alterations were made pursuant to a stipulation for that purpose contained in the contract, they were binding upon the surety, unless they were so extensive and material as to amount to a departure from the original contract rather than a permissible modification of its details. United States v. Freel, 92 Fed. 299, 39 C. C. A. 491, 99 Fed. 237, \n186 U.S. 309\n, 46 L. ed. 1177, 22 Sup. Ct. Sup. 875.\n So far as the certificate shows, however, the contract here in question contained no clause permitting changes. In such case it is beside the question to inquire whether the changes were important, or, indeed, whether they prejudiced or benefited the contractor. The rule that obtains in ordinary cases is that any change in the contract made between the principals without the consent of the surety discharges the obligation of the latter, even though the change be beneficial to the principal obligor.\n But it lies at the foundation of this rule of strictissimi juris that the agreement altering the undertaking of the principal must be participated in by the obligee or creditor, in order that it may have the effect of discharging the surety. This is expressed or implied in all the cases. Miller v. Stewart, 9 Wheat, 680, 703, 708, 709, 6 L. ed. 189, 195- 197; Sprigg v. Bank of Mt. Pleasant, 14 Pet. 201, 208, 10 L. ed. 419, 422; Magee v. Manhattan L. Ins. Co. \n92 \nU.S. 93, 98\n, 23 S. L. ed. 699, 700; Union Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Hanford, \n143 \nU.S. 187, 191\n, 36 S. L. ed. 118, 120, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 437; Prairie State Nat. Bank v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 227, 233\n, 41 S. L. ed. 412, 416, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 142; United States v. Freel. \n186 \nU.S. 309, 310\n, 371 S., 46 L. ed. 1177, 1178, 1181, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 875.\n In the case of a bond given under a statute such as the act of February 28, 1899, there is no single obligee or creditor. The surety is charged with notice that he is entering into what is, in a very proper sense, a public obligation, and one that will be relied upon by persons who can in no manner control the conduct of the nominal obligee, and with respect to whom the latter is a mere \n\n[234 U.S. 448, 458]\n\u00a0\n trustee, and therefore incapable, upon general principles of equity, of bartering away, for its own benefit or convenience, the rights of the beneficiaries. In the light of the statute, the surety becomes bound for the performance of the work by the principal in accordance with the stipulations of the contract, and for the prompt payment of the sums due to all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract.\n What would be the result of a change not contemplated in the original contract, as between the District of Columbia, consenting to the change, and the surety company, not consenting thereto, is a question not now before us, and respecting which we express no opinion. But, with respect to obligations incurred by the contractor to laborers and materialmen, at least, so far as their labor and materials are supplied in accordance with the original contract, it is obvious, we think, that a construction which would discharge the surety because of any change to which the laborers and materialmen were not parties would defeat the principal object that Congress had in view in enacting the statute. If the change were so great as to amount to an abandonment of the contract and the substitution of a substantially different one, so that persons supplying labor and materials would necessarily be charged with notice of such abandonment, a different question would be presented. But, in the case of such a change as was here made,-a mere change of position and location of the building, without affecting its general character; involving changes in grading, but having nothing to do with the furnishing of the materials upon which the action is based,-it seems to us that the responsibility of the surety to the materialman remains unaffected.\n The question certified will be answered in the negative. \n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nERIE R.

This act shall take effect October 1st. 1907.' \n\n[233 U.S. 671, 676]\n\u00a0\n It is alleged that at the times hereinafter mentioned the railroad company was a corporation under the laws of the state of New York, and was and is operating a line of railroad in the state of New York, in Rockland county and \n\n[233 U.S. 671, 677]\n\u00a0\n other counties, extending from Piermont to Dunkirk, both in that state.\n\n The following facts are also alleged: The railroad company, in violation of  7a of the labor law, required and permitted one David Henion, a telegraph operator, to be on duty more than eight hours, that is, from 7 o'clock, A. M. to 7 o'clock, P. M., on the 1st day of November, 1907, in the railroad company's tower at Sterlington, in the county of Rockland, New York, there being no extraordinary emergency caused by accident, fire, flood, or danger to life or property.\n His duty was to space trains by the use of the telegraph under what is known and termed the 'block system,' and to report trains to another office or offices and to train despatchers, whose duties pertain to the movement of cars, engines, and trains on the company's railroad, by the use of the telegraph.\n There passed over the tracks of the railroad company on the day named more than eight regular passenger trains each way.\n Judgment is prayed in the sum of $100.\n The answer of the railroad company admits its incorporation and that it is operating a railroad as alleged, but alleges that its road extends from Jersey City, New Jersey, to Suffern, New York, and from Salamanca, New York, to Marion, state of Ohio, and elsewhere, passing through New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, and that at all times mentioned in the complaint it was and is now engaged in interstate commerce and the transportation of persons, goods, and merchandise by railroad from one state of the United States to other states of the United States, and to foreign countries. \n\n[233 U.S. 671, 678]\n\u00a0\n It admits that the company required and permitted Henion to work as charged, but alleges that the cars, engines, and trains that he was engaged in spacing and reporting were engaged in interstate commerce.\n That the labor law of the state violates the 5th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, as applied to Henion and other employees in the same class of work, in that it deprives both the railroad company and Henion of the liberty of contract and of property without due process of law, and of the equal protection of the laws.\n The answer also set up in defense the Federal 'hours of service' act approved March 4, 1907, in force one year after its passage (34 Stat. at L. 1415, chap. 2939, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1321), entitled, 'An Act to Promote the Safety of Employees and Travelers upon Railroads by Limiting the Hours of Service of Employees Thereon.'\n The law, among other things, authorizes the employment of employees such as Henion was, for nine hours in twenty-four-hour periods when employed night and day, and for thirteen hours when employed only during the daytime, and, in case of extraordinary emergency, to be on duty for four additional hours in such period on not exceeding three days in any week. \n'Sec. 2. That it shall be unlawful for any common carrier, its officers or agents, subject to this act, to require or permit any employee subject to this act to be or remain on duty for a longer period than sixteen consecutive hours. . . .\n\n'Provided, That no operator, train despatcher, or other employee who, by the use of the telegraph or telephone, despatches, reports, transmits, receives, or delivers orders pertaining to or affecting train movements, shall be required or permitted to be or remain on duty for a longer period than nine hours in any twenty-four-hour period in all towers, offices, places, and stations continuously operated night and day, nor for a longer period than thirteen hours in all towers, offices, places, and stations operated only during the daytime, except in case of emergency, when the employees named in this proviso may be permitted to be and remain on duty for four additional hours in a twenty-four-hour period on not exceeding three days in any week; . . .' \n\n[233 U.S. 671, 679]\n\u00a0\n The answer also alleges that the jurisdiction of Congress is exclusive, and that the labor law of 1907 is in excess of the power of the legislature of the state of New York and unconstitutional and void, in that it is an attempt to regulate commerce between the states.\n\n A jury was waived and the case tried by the court, which found the facts as alleged in the complaint, and that upon the trains which passed the tower at Sterlington there 'were passengers whose journey commenced and ended in the state of New York, and did not extend into any other state, and some of said trains carrying passengers and property from one point to another in the state of New York.'\n As a conclusion of law the court found that the railroad company violated the law, had incurred a penalty of $100 by so doing, and that  7a of the law 'is valid and its provisions do not violate and are not in conflict with the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the state of New York.'\n Upon the request of the railroad company the court also found the facts of the interstate character of the railroad as alleged in the answer, and that Henion was employed as alleged, and found a number of other facts concerning the manner of operating the 'block system' and the duties of Henion. There were also findings relative to the labor law, the penal law, so called, and the act of Congress of March 4, 1907. The findings only serve to emphasize the defenses of the company, and need not be set out at length.\n The court also made the following findings:\n'That at all times mentioned in the complaint, or hereinafter mentioned, the defendant was, and now is, engaged in interstate commerce, and the transportation of persons, \n\n[233 U.S. 671, 680]\n\u00a0\n goods, and merchandise by railroad from one state of the United States to other states of the United States.\n\n'On that day [the day Henion was employed] there were fourteen eastbound and twelve westbound passenger trains, and twelve eastbound and fifteen westbound freight trains, which passed the Sterlington tower during said twelve hours.\n\n'On November 1st, 1907, a majority of the trains which the said David Henion was engaged in spacing and reporting were engaged in interstate commerce or in the transportation of passengers, persons, or property from one state to another.'\n\n The court refused to find-'That on November 1, 1907, said David Henion, in the performance of his duties, was an employee of the defendant, engaged in interstate commerce.'\n The court further found that the effect of the labor law 'was materially to inerease the cost to the Erie Railroad Company of operating the 'Block System.\"\n Judgment was entered for the penalty sued for. It was reversed by the appellate division, and a new trial granted, the court deciding that the jurisdiction of the subject-matter was exclusively in Congress and was exercised by the hours of service law of March 4, 1907\n\n\n The court of appeals reversed the action of the appellate division and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court of appeals rested its decision on three propositions: (1) The labor law of the state was a legal exercise of the police power of the state. (2) There was no conflict between it and the act of Congress of March 4, 1907. 'The state,' the court said, 'has simply supplemented the action of the Federal authorities. It is the same as if Congress had enacted that the classes of employees named might be employed for nine hours or less, and the state had then fixed the lesser number, which was left open by the Federal statute. The form of the latter \n\n[233 U.S. 671, 681]\n\u00a0\n fixed the outside limit, but not expressly legalizing employment up to that limit, fairly seems to have invited and to have left the subject open for supplemental state legislation if necessary.' (3) A statute does not become controlling until it actually becomes operative; and that therefore, even if it should be decided that there was a conflict between the Federal and the state legislation after the former became effective, as the act of Congress did not take effect until March 4, 1908, in the meantime the state law was in operation.\n The propositions decided by the court of appeals express the contentions made here by defendant in error, and they are attempted to be supported by a citation of a number of cases in which this court has sustained legislation by the states more or less affecting interstate commerce. A review of them is unnecessary. Whatever difficulty may otherwise have been in the questions presented by the record has been met and overcome by decisions more apposite than the cited cases. The relative supremacy of the state and national power over interstate commerce need not be commented upon. Where there is conflict, the state legislation must give way. Indeed, when Congress acts in such a way as to manifest its purpose to exercise its constitutional anthority, the regulating power of the state ceases to exist. Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 57 L. ed. 314, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148, and cases cited. Also Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v.

It was given application to an instance like that in the case at bar in Northern P. R. Co. v. Washington, \n222 U.S. 370\n, 56 L. ed. 237, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 160. The case arose upon an asserted conflict between the hours of service law of March 4, 1907, the one involved here, and a law of the state of Washington which also regulated the hours \n\n[233 U.S. 671, 682]\n\u00a0\n of railway employees. The latter became effective June 12, 1907; that is, before the time the Federal hours of service law was in force, but after its enactment. The state act resembled the Federal act, and prohibited the consecutive hours of service which had taken place on the Northern Pacific Railroad, and on account of which the action was brought by the attorney general of the state against the comjany for the penalties prescribed for violation of the act. The railroad company admitted the facts, but denied liability under the act, asserting that its train was an interstate train and was not subject to the control of the state, because within the exclusive control of Congress on that subject. The trial court granted a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. That court held that the train was an interstate train, and conceded that Congress might prescribe the number of consecutive hours an employee of a carrier so engaged should be required to remain on duty; and when it is so legislated upon the subject, its act superseded any and all state legislation on that particular subject. But the court held that the act of Congress did not apply because of its provision that it should not take effect until one year after its passage, and until such time it should be treated as not existing.\n We reversed the judgment on the ground that the view expressed was not 'compatible with the paramount power of Congress over interstate commerce,' and we considered it elementary that the police power of the state could only exist from the silence of Congress upon the subject, and ceased when Congress acted or manifested its purpose to call into play its exclusive power. It was further said that the mere fact of the enactment of the act of March 4, 1907, was a manifestation of the will of Congress to bring the subject within its control, and to reason that because Congress chose to make its prohibitions take effect only after a year, it was intended to leave the subject to state \n\n[233 U.S. 671, 683]\n\u00a0\n power, was to cause the act of Congress to destroy itself. There was no conceivable reason, it was said, for postponing the prohibitions if it was contemplated that the state law should apply in the meantime. The reason for the postponement, it was pointed out, was to enable the railroads to meet the new conditions.\n The reasoning of the opinion and the decision oppose the contention of defendant in error and of the court of appeals, that the state law and the Federal law can stand together, because, as expressed by the court of appeals, 'the state has simply supplemented the action of the Federal authorities,' and, on account of special conditions prevailing within its limits, has raised the limit of safety; and the form of the Federal statute, although 'not expressly legalizing employment up to that limit, fairly seems to have invited and to have left the subject open for supplemental state legislation if necessary.'\n We realize the strength of these observations, but they put out of view, we think, the ground of decision of the cases, and, indeed, the necessary condition of the supremacy of the congressional power. It is not that there may be division of the field of regulation, but an exclusive occupation of it when Congress manifests a purpose to enter it.\n Regulation is not intended to be a mere wanton exercise of power. It is a restriction upon the management of the railroads. It is induced by the public interest or safety, and the 'hours of service' law of March 4, 1907, is the judgment of Congress of the extent of the restriction necessary. It admits of no supplement; it is the prescribed measure of what is necessary and sufficient for the public safety, and of the cost and burden which the railroad must endure to secure it.\n Defendant in error attempts to distinguish Northern P. R. Co. v. Washington, on the ground that the state was dealing with a corporation organized \n\n[233 U.S. 671, 684]\n\u00a0\n under the laws of another state, and, the state of Washington had no power to alter or repeal its charter. This power, it is contended, the state of New York has over the Erie Railroad, and exercised the power in the law under review, and that the court of appeals has so decided. It is asserted besides, that Henion was not engaged in interstate commerce. These assertions are not justified. The court of appeals did not decide that the labor law constituted an alteration or repeal of the charter of the company. The learned judge who delivered the opinion of the court expressed such to be his view, saying that 'if the statute violated is a valid exercise of the power, personally' he was 'not doubtful that under its reserved control over corporations the legislature might pass such an act in regulation of the performance of the business for which a railroad was organized.'\n It is clear that the learned judge did not express the views of the court. We have no doubt that if the court entertained such view it would have been declared. It would have been a direct, and, from the standpoint of the state, and adequate, solution of the questions involved, and would have made unnecessary the elaborate consideration of the extent of the police power of the state and its coincident exercise and adjustment with congressional power of regulation. The contention of defendant in error, therefore, has not the foundation asserted for it, and we may pass it without further comment, not considering whether it is competent for a state, through its power to alter or repeal the charter of railroads incorporated under its laws, to displace or share the jurisdiction of Congress over interstate commerce.\n The assertion that Henion was not engaged in interstate commerce is also without foundation, and is, besides, precluded by the opinion of the court of appeals. The interstate character of the business was recognized by the court, and the law considered in view of such recognition. The \n\n[233 U.S. 671, 685]\n\u00a0\n court said 'that the labor law purports and attempts, indiscriminately and inseparably, to regulate the hours of the classes of employees designated, whether engaged in interstate or local traffic, and that, therefore, its validity must be tested by the power of the legislature over the former.' [ 198 N. Y. 376, 29 L.R.A.(N.S.) 240, 139 Am. St. Rep. 828, 91 N. E. 849, 19 Ann. Cas. 811.]\n The trial court, it is true, undertook to make a distinction between the interstate business of the railroad and Henion's duties, but, in view of the cases which we have cited, and of the decision of the appellate division and of the court of appeals, the distinction is untenable.

WILLIAMS(1914)\nNo. 274\nArgued: April 27, 1914Decided: May 25, 1914\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 685, 687]\n\u00a0\n Suit brought by plaintiff in error, the Erie Railroad Company (as it was plaintiff below, we shall so designate it), to restrain the defendant in error (herein called defendant) from instituting actions to recover penalties for noncompliance with the provisions of the labor law of the state of New York, which required plaintiff to pay its employees semimonthly and in cash.\n The object of the suit is to test the constitutionality of the law.\n The bill is very elaborate and alleges with much detail the following facts: Plaintiff is a New York corporation, and defendant is commissioner of labor of the state. Plaintiff maintains a railroad in New York which extends into other states, and operates car floats and other floating equipment, navigating the navigable waters of the United States. These and other equipment are used in the business of plaintiff as a common carrier of persons and property under and in compliance with tariffs duly promulgated and filed under the laws of the state and of the United States; and plaintiff is also a carrier of the United States mails. As a rule, the trains of plaintiff run over an operating division without change of employees. Some of the divisions are interstate and some wholly within the state of New York. \n\n[233 U.S. 685, 688]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiff, in carrying out its functions, has in its service upon that portion of its road lying east of Meadville, Pennsylvania, upwards of 15,000 men, who are employed either wholly within or partially within the state of New York, and nearly all of them are employed in the movement of interstate commerce. The great majority of these employees render service in more than one state, and many of them who reside in Pennsylvania or New Jersey render a part of their service in New York, and many who reside in the latter state render service in the other two states. The contracts of employment of many of them were made, and in the future must be made, in states other than New York, in which states they must reside.\n By the laws of New York plaintiff was vested with its powers as a railroad and to contract and be contracted with for the employment of persons to conduct its operations and enterprises at and for such wages and upon such terms of payment as should or might be mutually agreed on; and thereunder it has been its custom to pay its employees monthly, and thus pay them prior to or on the 20th day of each month the wages earned during the preceding month.\n The great majority of plaintiff's employees were in its service prior to January 1, 1908, and all accepted such service with full knowledge of its general and uniform custom so to pay its employees monthly.\n Prior to January 1, 1908, there existed and has since existed a contract between plaintiff and its employees that the latter should be paid monthly as stated, and so to pay them, as distinguished from payment twice a month, is not inconsistent with the public interest, or hurtful to the public order, or detrimental to the common good.\n Section 4 of the labor law of the state makes it malfeasance in office for any officer, agent, or employee of the state to violate or evade his duty under \n\n[233 U.S. 685, 689]\n\u00a0\n the law, or knowingly permit the violation or evasion of the act, and he is subject to removal from office.\n Section 9 provides that every railroad company and\n'Section 9. Cash payment of wages.-Every manufacturing, mining, quarrying, mercantile, railroad, street railway, canal, steamboat, telegraph and telephone company, every express company, every corporation engaged in harvesting and storing ice, and every water company, not municipal, and every person, firm, or corporation engaged in or upon any public work for the state or any municipal corporation thereof, either as a contractor or a subcontractor therewith, shall pay to each employee engaged in his, their, or its business, the wages earned by such employee in cash. No such company, person, firm, or corporation shall hereafter pay such employees in script, commonly known as store money orders. [Laws 1897, chap. 415, as amended by Laws 1908, chap. 443.]\n\n'Section 10. When wages are to be paid.-Every corporation or joint stock association, or person carrying on the business thereof by lease or otherwise, shall pay weekly to each employee the wages earned by him to a day not more than six days prior to the date of such payment. But every person or corporation operating a steam surface railroad shall, on or before the 1st day of each month, pay the employees thereof the wages earned by them during the first half of the preceding month, ending with the 15th day thereof, and on or before the 15th day of each month pay the employees thereof the wages earned by them during the last half of the preceeding calendar month. [Laws 1897, chap. 415, as amended by Laws 1908, chap. 442.]\n\n'Section 11. Penalty for violation of preceding sections.-If a corporation or jointstock association, its lessee or other person carrying on the business thereof, shall fail to pay the wages of an employee, as provided in this article, it shall forfeit to the people of the state the sum of $50 for each such failure, to be recovered by the factory inspector in his name of office in a civil action; but an action shall not be maintained therefor unless the factory inspector shall have given to the employer at least ten days' written notice that such an action will be brought if the wages due are not sooner paid as provided in this article.\n\n'On the trial of such action, such corporation or association shall not be allowed to set up any defense, other than a valid assignment of such wages, a valid set-off against the same, or the absence of such employee from his regular place of labor at the time of payment, or an actual tender to such employee at the time of the payment of the wages so earned by him, or a breach of contract by such employee, or a denial of the employment.' [Laws 1897, chap. 415.] \n\n[233 U.S. 685, 690]\n\u00a0\n certain other companies shall pay their employees in cash, and no such company shall pay its employees in script, commonly known as store money orders.\n\n Section 10 requires the payment of employees' wages semimonthly.\n Section 11 imposes a penalty of $50 for each failure to so pay, to be recovered by the factory inspector in his name of office in a civil action, and limits the defenses to the action to a valid assignment of such wages, a valid set-off against the same, or the absence of such employee from his regular place of labor at the time of the payment, or an actual tender at the time of the payment, or a breach of contract by such employee, or a denial of the employment.\n The commissioner of labor is required to enforce the provisions of the law, and notified plaintiff of his intention to do so, and to sue for the penalties imposed by the act. He expressed his opinion of the act to be that each failure to pay the wages of each employee constituted a separate offense, and that the aggregate of the penalties would be $250, 000. Plaintiff believes, unless that officer is restrained, that he will exercise his authority under the act.\n The employees of plaintiff are distributed over more than 1,819 miles, and the making of the payment of their wages in money semimonthly instead of monthly will impose upon and subject plaintiff to an increased cost and expense of several thousand dollars each month.\n The difficulty of semimonthly payments is described, and it is alleged that the drastic and enormous penalties are, by reason of their necessarily aggregate character and effect, so excessive as to evidence legislative intention to unduly limit or prevent judicial inquiry, and practically constrain plaintiff to submit to the statute rather than, by contesting its validity, to take the chances of the penalties it imposes.\n That the statute by its terms prevents plaintiff from \n\n[233 U.S. 685, 691]\n\u00a0\n setting up in defense the contracts existing between it and its employees for the payment of their wages once a month, and that the statute violates, when applied to plaintiff, various provisions of the Constitution of the state and of the United States, and thereby is repugnant to article 3 of the Constitution of the United States and article 6 of the Constitution of the state of New York, in that it is an invasion by the legislative of the judicial power; and it is also repugnant to  1 of article 14 of the Constitution of the United States, and  6, article 1, of the Constitution of the state of New York, in that it deprives plaintiff of property without due process of law; and violates  10, article 1, of the Constitution of the United States, in that it impairs the obligation of contracts. The act in its other provisions deprives plaintiff of property without due process of law, and of the equal protection of the laws. It also interferes with and impairs plaintiff's performance and discharge of its duties as a common carrier in interstate commerce, is not a valid exercise of the police power, and is illegal and unenforceable and void under articles of the Constitution of the state and of the United States, which are enumerated.\n By the enforcement of the act plaintiff will be subjected to enormous penalties, a multiplicity of suits, and to great and irreparable damage, and plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law.\n The answer of the defendant admitted the allegations of the complaint as to the statute, and alleged that he intended to give such notice to plaintiff as to enforcing such penalties as he was required by the law to give and enforce. He denied that he had any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief regarding the truth of the other allegations of the complaint.\n A stipulation of facts was entered into by the parties upon which the court entered judgment dismissing the complaint. The judgment was successively affirmed by \n\n[233 U.S. 685, 692]\n\u00a0\n the appellate division of the supreme court and by the court of appeals.\n The facts stipulated practically sustain the allegations of the answer, and detail the manner of the payment by plaintiff of its employees. The plaintiff also introduced in evidence an exhibit which classified its employees and showed the number of days' work, total compensation and average compensation per day as per pay rolls for the year ending June 30, 1908. Its materiality was contested.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The contention of plaintiff is that the labor law is repugnant to the 14th Amendment, 'in that it deprives the company of property, and specifically deprives the company, and those of its employees to whom it applies, of liberty, without due process of law.' The contention may be limited at the outset to the rights of the company. It cannot complain for its employees; and before considering the contention thus limited, it is well to see what meaning or extent the court of appeals gave to the law.\n The court decided that the law operates not only to require the railroads to pay their employees semimonthly, but prohibits them from making contracts with their employees which shall vary the time of payment. If this were not the meaning of the law, the court said, neither railroads nor their employees would have any ground of complaint, 'as both master and servant would be left at liberty to make any contract they pleased in regard to the time when the servant's wages should be payable and the medium in which they should be paid.' This liberty not existing, the court stated the contention of the plaintiff to be that the law deprives it 'of the right to make contracts with its employees on advantageous terms, and that this was beyond the power of the legislature.' The plaintiff also contended that it was denied the equal protection of the laws.\n Messrs. Frederic D. McKenney and George F. Brownell for plaintiff in error. \n\n[233 U.S. 685, 693]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joseph A. Kellogg, Wilber W. Chambers, and Mr. Thomas Carmody, Attorney General of New York, for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n\n\n[233 U.S. 685, 698]\n\u00a0\n The opposing contentions were stated to be: (1) The legislation is a proper exercise of the power reserved by the Constitution of the state to amend corporate charters; (2) it constitutes a legitimate exercise of the police power of the state.\n The court rejected both contentions of plaintiff, and sustained the law as an exercise of the power over plaintiff's charter; and, adverting to the objection that the requirement of semimonthly payments was an unconstitutional interference with interstate commerce, the court said: 'It is to be observed that it [the law] is not in conflict with any legislation by Congress, nor does it affect interstate commerce directly.' And, exhibiting the extent of the operation of the law, it was further said: 'It relates to the wages of railway servants employed wholly within the state of New York, as well as to the wages of those whose duties take them from this state into others. The subject is one upon which Congress has not undertaken to act.' [New York, C. & H. R. R. Co. v. Williams, 199 N. Y. 123, 35 L.R.A.(N.S.) 549, 139 Am. St. Rep. 850, 92 N. E. 404.]\n How far the reserved power of the state over the charters of its corporations was helped out by its police power, the court gave no indication. Indeed, it may be said that, in its reference to the reserved power in reviewing the decisions of other states, the sole ground of its decision was the possession and exercise of such power by the state. The court said:\n'There is an irreconcilable conflict in the decisions in different jurisdictions as to the constitutional validity of labor legislation fixing the medium and time of payment of the wages of those who work for corporations. After the foregoing review of the leading cases, I find no difficulty in sustaining our New York statute on the ground which has been stated. It does not confiscate corporate property directly or indirectly. It does impose a greater future burden upon the corporations to which it relates; but that, I think, is within the power of the legislature to the extent to which it has been exercised in this case.' \n\n[233 U.S. 685, 699]\n\u00a0\n The legislation having been passed in the exercise of the reserved power of the state, is it valid, notwithstanding it prohibits both the plaintiff and its employees from contracting against its provisions? Plaintiff asserts the negative, and attempts to sustain the assertion by a very comprehensive argument in which a number of decisions of this court and of other courts are cited and reviewed. They illustrate by various instances the fundamental and indisputable principle that personal liberty includes the power to make contracts. But liberty of making contracts is subject to conditions in the interest of the public welfare, and which shall prevail-principle or condition-cannot be defined by any precise and universal formula. Each instance of asserted conflict must be determined by itself, and it has been said many times that each act of legislation has the support of the presumption that it is an exercise in the interest of the public. The burden is on him who attacks the legislation, and it is not sustained by declaring a liberty of contract. It can only be sustained by demonstrating that it conflicts with some constitutional restraint, or that the public welfare is not subserved by the legislation. The legislature is, in the first instance, the judge of what is necessary for the public welfare, and a judicial review of its judgment is limited. The earnest conflict of serious opinion does not suffice to bring it within the range of judicial cognizance. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 \nU.S. 549, 562\n, 55 S. L. ed. 328, 336, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 259; German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, \n233 U.S. 389\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 612.\n\n In considering the competency of the legislative judgment and the power the courts have to review it, we may inquire, what is here complained of? What does the labor law of New York do that seriously affects the liberty of plaintiff? It requires cash payments. That requirement is not now resisted. It requires semimonthly payments. Plaintiff now pays monthly. The extent of its grievance, therefore, is two payments a month instead of one, with \n\n[233 U.S. 685, 700]\n\u00a0\n the consequence of expense and inconvenience. It is hardly necessary to say that cost and inconvenience (different words, probably, for the same thing) would have to be very great before they could become an element in the consideration of the right of a state to exert its reserved power or its police power. New York & N. E. R. Co. v. Bristol, \n151 U.S. 556\n, 38 L. ed. 269, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 437; United States v. Union P. R. Co. \n160 U.S. 1\n, 40 L. ed. 319, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190; St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Paul, \n173 U.S. 404\n, 43 L. ed. 746, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 419; Wisconsin, M. & P. R. Co. v. Jacobson, \n179 U.S. 287\n, 45 L. ed. 194, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 115. See also Baltimore & O. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n221 U.S. 612\n, 55 L. ed. 878, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 621.\n Putting cost and inconvenience to one side, there would would remain only an abstract right. Taking them into consideration, they constitute the detriment to which plaintiff is subjected by not being able to make the forbidden contracts. It may be admitted an advantage is taken away from plaintiff, or, to put it another way, a burden is imposed upon it. Is it within the power of the state to impose the burden by virtue of its reserved control over plaintiff? The question must be answered as if the requirement of the law was part of the charter of plaintiff, and in such case it would seem certainly that a liberty of contract tract could not be asserted against it, for it would be a part of the contract accepted and binding on plaintiff,-a liberty exercised precluding a liberty to be exercised,-and it would seem necessarily to be the very essence of the right of amendment reserved that what could have been put in the charter originally, whatever its consequence, can be added to the charter, whatever the consequence of the addition. Of course, we mean what was and is competent for the state to impose; and we are brought to the narrow question whether a regulation of the time and manner of payment by a railroad of its employees is within the competency of the state to require. A negative answer is contended for, the argument urged to support the contention being that a contract right of dealing with its em- \n\n[233 U.S. 685, 701]\n\u00a0\n ployees is conferred by plaintiff's charter, which right the labor law takes away, and plaintiff is deprived of property because of the expense to which it is subjected, which, it is contended, is not justified by a corresponding public benefit. It would seem, therefore, to be the contention of plaintiff that it acquired by its charter a vested right to deal with its employees according to its own judgment, and, as alleged in its answer, that it was vested with its powers as a railroad and to contract and be contracted with, for the employment of persons to conduct its operations and enterprises at and for such wages and upon such terms of payment as might or should be agreed on. In other words, it is the contention that the rights asserted are of the very essence of its grant, giving it the rights of a natural person, and investing it with the same immunity from control, whether exercised under the police power or the reserved power of amendment. We may, in answering the contention, put aside the rights of natural persons and the rights which might exist under a Constitution which did not reserve control in the state. The effect of the control reserved was to make plaintiff, from the moment of creation, subject to the legislative power of alteration, and, if deemed expedient, of absolute extinguishment as a corporate body. Spring Valley Waterworks v. Schottler, \n110 \nU.S. 347, 352\n, 28 S. L. ed. 173, 175, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 48. And whether expedient or not is a question for the legislature, not for the courts. Id. 357. In other cases the effect of the reserved power of amendment is said to be to make any alteration or amendment of a charter subject to it which will not defeat or substantially impair the object of the grant or any right vested under the grant. Lake Shore & M. S. R. Co. v. Smith, \n173 \nU.S. 684, 697\n, 698 S., 43 L. ed. 858, 864, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 565; Looker v. Maynard, \n179 \nU.S. 46, 52\n, 45 S. L. ed. 79, 81, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 21. Surely the manner or time of paying employees does not come within such limitation. It is a matter of pure administration, not comparable in its burden to those sustained in the cases which we have already cited. \n\n[233 U.S. 685, 702]\n\u00a0\n In St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Paul, \n173 U.S. 404\n, 43 L. ed. 746, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 419, a law of Arkansas was sustained as an exercise of the reserved power of the state which required a railroad company discharging with or without cause, or refusing to employ, any servant or employee, to pay him his unpaid wages, then earned, at the contract rate, without abatement or deduction, to the date of his discharge, and providing that, if the same be not paid on such day, then, as a penalty for nonpayment, his wages shall continue at the same rate until paid.\n In New York & N. E. R. Co. v. Bristol, \n151 U.S. 556\n, 38 L. ed. 269, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 437, the railroad company was required to remove various grade crossings at its own expense.\n In the Sinking Fund Cases, \n99 U.S. 700\n, 25 L. ed. 496, legislation requiring the creation of a sinking fund was sustained under the reserved power of amendment, and, after reviewing the cases, the court said 'that whatever rules Congress might have prescribed in the original charter for the government of the corporation in the administration of its affairs, it retained the power to establish by amendment.' Many other cases might be cited, but to cite them would be to accumulate authorities on a proposition which might well be taken at this late date to be incontestable. Indeed, the contention of defendant that the legislation under review might be supported under the police power of the state has justification in cases.\n In Knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison, \n183 U.S. 13\n, 46 L. ed. 55, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1, a law of the state of Tennessee which required all persons and corporations to redeem in money evidences of indebtedness given to their laborers or employees, in the hands of their laborers, employees, or a bona fide holder, came up for consideration. The Knoxville Coal Company paid its employees in cash and in coal orders. It made money by the practice. There was no proof of an express agreement between the company and its employees that the orders should be paid only in coal, except as implied from \n\n[233 U.S. 685, 703]\n\u00a0\n accepting the orders, and no proof of an implied agreement except as drawn from the face of the orders and the custom of the company. There was no proof of compulsion except that if the employees did not accept pay in coal orders they had to submit to be in arrears about twenty days, but the company paid in coal orders the whole wages due at the end of each month. Harbison purchased a number of the coal orders and demanded their payment in cash, which was refused. He then brought suit against the company, relying on the statute. The Supreme Court gave him judgment, which was affirmed by this court on the ground that the law was a proper exercise of the police power of the state. This court, by Mr. Justice Shiras, commenting on St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Paul, supra, said that in that case stress was laid upon the reserved power of amendment which the state had, 'but it is also true that, inasmuch as the right of contract is not absolute in respect to every matter, but may be subjected to the restraints demanded by the safety and welfare of the state and its inhabitants, the police power of the state may, within definite limitations, extend over corporations outside of and regardless of the power to amend charters.' Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Matthews, \n174 U.S. 96\n, 43 L. ed. 909, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 609. The ruling was followed in Dayton Coal & I. Co. v. Barton, \n183 U.S. 23\n, 46 L. ed. 61, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 5, although the Dayton Company was not incorporated under the laws of Tennessee.\n In Mclean v. Arkansas, \n211 U.S. 539\n, 53 L. ed. 315, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 206, a law of Arkansas required, where miners were employed at quantity rates, and more than ten were employed, that they should be paid by the weight of coal mined by them as it comes from the mine and before it was passed over a screen of any kind. One of the grounds of attack on the law was that it was an unwarranted invasion of the right of contract secured by the 14th Amendment, the argument being that the law prevented the miners from con- \n\n[233 U.S. 685, 704]\n\u00a0\n tracting for wages upon the basis of screened coal instead of the weight of the coal as originally produced at the mine. The law was sustained as a proper exercise of the police power of the state.\n It is, however, contended by plaintiff, that the law under review cannot be sustained either as an exertion of the police power or as an alteration of the charter of plaintiff, unless the court can say from a comparison of the systems of payment-monthly and semimonthly-that the former affects adversely the general welfare or public good, and the latter 'remedies that evil or condition, and of itself does not constitute an unjust burden upon the employer.' But whether the law imposes an unjust burden depends upon its validity, and whether the public welfare is subserved by one system or the other is, as we have said, in the first instance, for the legislature to determine, and its judgment will not be reviewed unless 'unmistakably and palpably in excess of legislative power.' McLean v. Arkansas, supra. The labor law of New York cannot be so characterized.\n There are certainly advantages of cash payment over deferred payments, and an advantage to those who work for a living of a ready purchasing power for their needs over the use of credit. This is found as a fact by the trial court, and even if there is no affirmative evidence of it, it is the expression of experience.\n The next contention of plaintiff is that the cost of paying twice a month is a direct burden on interstate commerce. It is not necessary to review and compare the cases in which this court has pointed out the difference between a direct and indirect burden of state legislation upon interstate commerce, or the power of the states in the absence of regulation by Congress. It is enough to say in the present case that Congress has not acted, and there is not, therefore, that impediment to the law of the state; nor is there prohibition in the character of the burden. The \n\n[233 U.S. 685, 705]\n\u00a0\n effect of the provision is merely administrative, and so far as it affects interstate commerce, it does so indirectly. The court of appeals, as we have seen, considered that the law relates to the wages of railway servants employed wholly within the state, and to those whose duties take them from the state into other states. In other words, did not make it applicable to those employed in other states, and it therefore does not embrace all of the employees of plaintiff, and the contention based upon its application to all is without foundation.\n The last contention of plaintiff is that the statute violates the 14th Amendment, 'in that it denies to the employees of the Erie Railroad Company the equal protection of the laws.' Considerable argument is made to support the contention, in which a comparison is made between the employees-mechanics, workmen, and laborers-to whom the law applies, and the other employees of the company, and it is declared that all, if any, suffer from monthly payments, and all are entitled, therefore, to receive the benefit of semimonthly payments. But, as we have said, employees are not complaining, and whatever rights those excluded may have, plaintiff cannot invoke.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Leave granted on June 22, 1914, to present petition for rehearing within thirty days. \n\n\n\n\n","65":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFALLOWS v. CONTINENTAL & COMMERCIAL TRUST & SAVINGS BANK(1914)\nNo. 69\nArgued: Decided: November 30, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 300, 301]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edwin H. Cassels for appellant.\n Mr. Herman Frank for appellee.\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 300, 303]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the court:\n Bonds amounting to $20,000 were issued to Fallows, trustee, by the Tengwall Company, October 7, 1905, payable fifteen years thereafter. To secure them a trust deed or mortgage covering all its personal property was executed and duly recorded in Cook county, Illinois, November 1, 1905; an affidavit for the extension of this was filed October 5, 1908; and a second one October 6, 1909. On June 3, 1910, it gave promissory notes to sundry creditors, aggregating more than $25,000; the same day the holders took judgments thereon by confession in the superior court of Cook county; executions were taken out at once and delivered to the sheriff for service, but no levy was ever made. \n\n[235 U.S. 300, 304]\n\u00a0\n June 4, 1910, a petition in involuntary bankruptcy was filed against the company; a receiver, immediately appointed, took possession of its property; and an adjudication of bankruptcy followed, June 17th. The Continental & Commercial Trust & Savings Bank was duly selected as trustee August 9th, and shortly thereafter presented a petition asking that the lien created by the executions upon the judgments of June 3d be preserved, and that it be subrogated thereto for the benefit of the estate. ( Bankruptcy act,  67c.) The referee held appellant's answer resisting this petition insufficient, and allowed the subrogation as prayed.\n The appellant sought to have all the bonds issued to him allowed as a preferred debt, claiming that they were secured by the above-mentioned trust deed, the lien of which was good as against all the world. The trustee in bankruptcy objected upon the ground that the deed could not prevail over the execution creditors because the Illinois statute limited its effect to three years, subject only to a single extension of twelve months, and even if another were possible, the second affidavit for extension filed October 6, 1909, was one day too late, and therefore unavailing. The referee sustained the objection and entered an order refusing to allow a preference in favor of the bonds. The district court approved this action, and its decree was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals (119 C. C. A. 420, 201 Fed. 82). Thereupon an appeal was taken to this court.\n Three assignments of error are relied upon: (1) The order of the referee, undertaking to subrogate the trustee to the judgment creditors' liens, was erroneous and ought not to have been approved. (2) The trust deed of October 7, 1905, constituted a valid first lien upon all the property specified therein when the bankruptcy proceedings were begun. (3) The executions issued upon judgments of June 3, 1910, created no liens upon the bankrupt's property. \n\n[235 U.S. 300, 305]\n\u00a0\n Section 67f of the bankruptcy act, approved July 1, 1898 (30 Stat. at L. 544, 565, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3418, 3450), is copied in the margin. \n1\n Its purposes have been pointed out in First Nat. Bank v. Staake, \n202 U.S. 141\n, 50 L. ed. 967, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 580, and Rock Island Plow Co. v. Reardon, \n222 U.S. 354\n, 56 L. ed. 231, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 164.\n The propriety of subrogating the trustee to whatever liens were acquired under the judgments has been sustained by the three tribunals below. There is no proof showing an abuse of the discretion necessarily vested in them, and we accept their action in that regard as correct.\n The validity and priority of the liens in question depend on the laws of the state, and  9, chapter 77, and  1 and 4, chapter 95, of Hurd's Revised Statutes of Illinois, are pertinent. They are copied in the margin. 2 \n\n[235 U.S. 300, 306]\n\u00a0\n The provisions relative to the continuation of a mortgage after three years have not been definitely and authoritatively construed by the courts of Illinois. The circuit court of appeals concluded that under them a mortgage lien expires as to judgment creditors three years after recordation, subject to one extension of twelve months from the filing of an affidavit in strict conformity with \n\n[235 U.S. 300, 307]\n\u00a0\n the prescribed requirements. This conclusion harmonizes with the purpose and history of the statute, and we think is correct. The lien claimed by appellant, as against judgment creditors, therefore, did not continue after the 5th day of October, 1909, and the attempt further to extend it was ineffective. Cook v. Thayer, 11 Ill. 617; Porter v. Dement, 35 Ill. 478, 480; Silvis v. Aultman, 141 Ill. 632, 31 N. E. 11; Re New York Economical Printing Co. 49 C. C. A. 133, 110 Fed. 514; Jones, Chat. Mortg. 5th ed. p. 287.\n There is no adequate proof that the judgments against the bankrupt were fraudulently obtained. The referee found the executions were delivered to the sheriff for service; and appellant maintains this conclusively shows they were not 'delivered to the sheriff or other proper officer to be executed,' as required by statutute,-that 'service' does not include 'levy.' The record discloses no instruction to the officer to refrain from carrying out the mandate of the writs, nor are there facts which clearly indicate a conditional delivery.\n The circuit court of appeals decided that, under the circumstances of the present case, the word 'service' must be taken to include levy, saying: 'In Peck v. City Nat. Bank, 51 Mich. 353, 47 Am. Rep. 577, 16 N. W. 681, it is said: 'Service of an execution includes every act and proceeding necessary to be taken by the sheriff to make the money, and includes the sale of the property when necessary.' The word has been defined to mean 'execution of process.' 35 Cyc. 1432. This construction seems to us reasonable in the case before us. It would be placing a strained meaning upon the transaction to hold that when a party places an execution in the hands of a process officer, the latter is not charged with the duty, without further instructions, to proceed to make the money called for by the writ, which itself commands him to do so. In the absence of directions not to levy, it is the duty \n\n[235 U.S. 300, 308]\n\u00a0\n of the officer to obey the directions and commands of the writ.'\n We are of opinion that the courts below properly interpreted the finding of the referee, and that the execution creditors secured valid prior liens upon the bankrupt's property. The decree is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'That all levies, judgments, attachments, or other liens, obtained through legal proceedings against a person who is insolvent, at any time within four months prior to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy against him, shall be deemed null and void in case he is adjudged a bankrupt, and the property affected by the levy, judgment, attachment, or other lien shall be deemed wholly discharged and released from the same, and shall pass to the trustee as a part of the estate of the bankrupt, unless the court shall, on due notice, order that the right under such levy, judgment, attachment, or other lien shall be preserved for the benefit of the estate; and thereupon the same may pass to and shall be preserved by the trustee for the benefit of the estate as aforesaid. And the court may order such conveyance as shall be necessary to carry the purposes of this section into effect: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall have the effect to destroy or impair the title obtained by such levy, judgment, attachment, or other lien, of a bona fide purchaser for value who shall have acquired the same without notice or reasonable cause for inquiry.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] ' 9. No execution shall bind the goods and chattels of the person against whom it is issued, until it is delivered to the sheriff or other proper officer to be executed; and for the better manifestation of the time, the sheriff or other officer shall, on receipt of such writ, indorse upon the back thereof the day of the month and year and hour when he received the same.'\n' 1. That no mortgage, trust deed, or other conveyance of personal property having the effect of a mortgage or lien upon such property shall be valid as against the rights and interests of any third person, unless possession thereof shall be delivered to and remain with the grantee, or the instrument shall provide for the possession of the property to remain with the grantor, and the instrument is acknowledged and recorded as hereinafter directed; and every such instrument shall, for the purposes of this act, be deemed a chattel mortgage.'\n\n' 4. Such mortgage, trust deed, or other conveyance of personal property acknowledged as provided in this act shall be admitted to record by the recorder of the county in which the mortgagor shall reside at the time when the instrument is executed and recorded, or, in case the mortgagor is not a resident of this state, then in the county where the property is situated and kept, and shall thereupon, if bona fide, be good and valid from the time \n\n it is filed for record until the maturity of the entire debt or obligation, or extension thereof made so hereinafter specified: Provided, such time shall not exceed three years from the filing of the mortgage unless within thirty days next preceding the expiration of such three years, or if the debt or obligation matures within such three years, then, within thirty days next preceding the maturity of said debt or obligation, the mortgagor and mortgagee, his or their agent or attorney, shall file for record in the office of the recorder of deeds of the county where the original mortgage is recorded, also with the justice of the peace, or his successor, upon whose docket the same was entered, an affidavit setting forth particularly the interest which the mortgagee has by virtue of such mortgage in the property therein mentioned, and if such mortgage is for the payment of money, the amount remaining unpaid thereon, and the time when the same will become due by extension or otherwise; which affidavit shall be recorded by such recorder and be entered upon the docket of said justice of the peace, and thereupon the mortgage lien originally acquired shall be continued and extended for and during the term of one year from the filing of such affidavit, or until the maturity of the indebtedness or extension thereof secured by said mortgage: Provided, such time shall not exceed one year from the date of filing such affidavit.' \n\n\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFARMERS' & MECHANICS' SAV.

W. 445, 851), affirming the judgment of a lower court, in proceedings for the collection of taxes assessed against plaintiff in error for the year 1908. Plaintiff in error is a savings bank, having no capital stock, and was taxable under  839, Rev. Laws 1905, which provides for ascertaining the surplus remaining after deducting from its assets (other than real estate, which is separately assessed) the amount \n\n[232 U.S. 516, 521]\n\u00a0\n of the deposits and of all other accounts payable; the surplus to be taxed as 'credits.' The supreme court of Minnesota held that this section imposes not a franchise but a property tax, and that the surplus of savings banks as thus determined is taxable property. This construction is not questioned here; perhaps is not open to question.\n Two Federal questions are raised.\n First, the savings bank insisted in the state courts, and here renews the insistence, that certain bonds issued by municipalities in Indian territory and in the territory of Oklahoma, held by the bank, amounting to about $700,000 in value, should have been omitted from the list of its personal assets, for the reason that bonds of this character are not taxable by the state.\n This question, although novel, is to be solved by the application of principles long established.\n It was laid down by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for this court in M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 436, 4 L. ed. 579, 607, 608, that the state could not constitutionally impose taxation upon the operations of a local branch of the United States Bank, because the bank was an agency of the Federal government, and the states had no power, by taxation or otherwise, to hamper the execution by that government of the powers conferred upon it by the people. The supremacy of the Federal Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof, and the entire independence of the general government from any control by the respective states, were the fundamental grounds of the decision. The principle has never since been departed from, and has often been reasserted and applied. Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 859, 6 L. ed. 204, 233; Home Sav. Bank v. Des Moines, \n205 \nU.S. 503, 513\n, 51 S. L. ed. 901, 907, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 571; Grether v. Wright, 23 C. C. A. 498, 43 U. S. App. 770, 75 Fed. 742, 753.\n State taxation of national bank shares, as permitted by the act of Congress, without regard to the fact that a \n\n[232 U.S. 516, 522]\n\u00a0\n part or the whole of the capital of the bank is invested in national securities which are exempt from taxation (Van Allen v. Assessors [ Churchill v. Utica], 3 Wall. 573, 583, 18 L. ed. 229, 234; Bradly v. Illinois, 4 Wall. 459, 18 L. ed. 433; First Nat. Bank v. Kentucky, 9 Wall. 353, 359, 19 L. ed. 701, 702), is an apparent, not a real, exception. The same is true of taxes upon the mere property of agencies of the Federal government (Thomson v. Union P. R. Co. 9 Wall. 579, 589, 19 L. ed. 792, 798; Union P. R. Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 32, 34, 21 L. ed. 787, 792, 793). Indeed, these exceptions rest upon distinctions that were recognized in the decision of M'Culloch v. Maryland. Chief Justice Marshall said, in closing the discussion: 'This opinion . . . does not extend to a tax paid by the real property of the bank, in common with the other real property within the state, nor to a tax imposed on the interest which the citizens of Maryland may hold in this institution, in common with other property of the same description throughout the state. But this is a tax on the operations of the bank, and is, consequently, a tax on the operation of an instrument employed by the government of the Union to carry its powers into execution. Such a tax must be unconstitutional.' For a fuller discussion of the Van Allen Case, see Home Sav. Bank v. Des Moines, \n205 \nU.S. 503, 517\n, 51 S. L. ed. 901, 909, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 571.\n The government of the respective territories in question was that provided by the act of Congress of May 2, 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 81, 93, chap. 182), of which the first 28 sections created a temporary government for the territory of Oklahoma; while  29 (p. 93) and subsequent sections established laws for the government of what was thereafter to be known as the Indian territory, but without conferring general powers of local self- government. To the territorial government of Oklahoma legislative power was granted ( 6), extending to 'all rightful subjects of legislation not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.' Municipal corporations were in contemplation. Sec. 7 provided that \n\n[232 U.S. 516, 523]\n\u00a0\n the legislative assembly should not authorize the issuing of any bond or evidence of debt by any county, city, town, or township for the construction of any railroad; thus recognizing that the borrowing power might be employed for other purposes. By  11, certain provisions of the Compiled Laws of Nebraska, in force November 1, 1889, so far as locally applicable, were extended to and put in force in the territory until after the adjournment of the first session of its legislative assembly; among these being chapter 14, entitled, 'Cities of the Second Class and Villages,' which contains provisions for the organization of municipal corporations, with power to borrow money for public purposes. The Indian territory was not made an 'organized territory,' but by  31 certain general laws of the state of Arkansas, as published in Mansfield's Digest (1884), were put in force there until Congress should otherwise provide; among these, the chapter relating to municipal corporations ( 722-959).\n It is not disputed that the municipal bonds now in question were lawfully authorized and are in every respect valid obligations of the respective municipalities. Except as such obligations they would hardly be treated as taxable property in the hands of the holder.\n The relation of the organized territories to the United States has been frequently adverted to. In First Nat. Bank v. Yankton County, \n101 \nU.S. 129, 133\n, 25 S. L. ed. 1046, 1047, which had to do with the organic act of the territory of Dakota (12 Stat. at L. 239, chap. 86), the court, speaking by Mr. Chief Justice Waite, said:\n'All territory within the jurisdiction of the United States, not included in any state, must necessarily be governed by or under the authority of Congress. The territories are but political subdivisions of the outlying dominion of the United States. Their relation to the general government is much the same as that which counties bear to the respective states, and Congress may \n\n[232 U.S. 516, 524]\n\u00a0\n legislate for them as a state does for its municipal organizations. . . . Congress may not only abrogate laws of the territorial legislatures, but it may itself legislate directly for the local government. It may make a void act of the territorial legislature valid, and a valid act void. In other words, it has full and complete legislative authority over the people of the territories and all the departments of the territorial governments. It may do for the territories what the people, under the Constitution of the United States, may do for the states.'\n\n The territory of Oklahoma, therefore, was an instrumentality established by Congress for the government of the people within its borders, with authority to subdelegate the governmental power to the several municipal corporations therein. These corporations were established for public and governmental purposes only, and exercised their powers and performed their functions as agents of the central authority. With respect to Indian territory, the situation under the act of 1890 was somewhat different, and the municipal corporations derived their authority directly from the act of Congress.\n No doubt, as is usual in such cases, the people of the respective municipalities had a more immediate and direct interest than others in the local government, and in the local improvements that presumably may have been constructed with the proceeds of the municipal bonds. But this interest was that of eitizens and taxpayers, not that of proprietors. And the policy of Congress, as manifested in its legislation upon the subject, had regard not merely, nor even chiefly, for the particular and immediate interests of the several municipalities. It looked to the promotion of the prosperity and welfare of the whole people of the United States, through the development of organized self-governing communities-afterwards to become states of the Union-throughout the whole of the public domain. With statehood as the ultimate aim and \n\n[232 U.S. 516, 525]\n\u00a0\n purpose, the organic acts were consciously framed. They were frequently, if not always, entitled: 'An Act to Provide a Temporary Government for the Territory,' etc.; and so reads the title of the act of May 2, 1890\n\n\n In our opinion, therefore, the municipalities of the territory of Oklahoma and of Indian territory were instrumentalities and agencies of the Federal government, with whose operations the states were not permitted to interfere by taxation or otherwise; and the issuing of municipal bonds was the performance of a governmental function, within the established doctrine. And we deem it immaterial that these bonds were not guaranteed by the United States, or even (in the case of the Oklahoma bonds) by the central government of the territory.\n The supreme court of Minnesota, conceding that the municipalities were Federal agencies in the performance of governmental functions, yet deemed that a material narrowing of the doctrine of M'Culloch v. Maryland was to be inferred from an expression contained in the opinion of this court in First Nat. Bank v. Kentucky, 9 Wall. 353, 362, 19 L. ed. 701, 703, where it was said: 'The principle we are discussing has its limitation,-a limitation growing out of the necessity on which the principle itself is founded. That limitation is, that the agencies of the Federal government are only exempted from state legislation so far as that legislation may interfere with or impair their efficiency in performing the functions by which they are designed to serve that government.' And from a like expression contained in the opinion in Union P. R. Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5, 36, 21 L. ed. 787, 793: 'It is therefore manifest that exemption of Federal agencies from state taxation is dependent not upon the nature of the agents, or upon the mode of their constitution, or upon the fact that they are agents, but upon the effect of the tax; that is, upon the question whether the tax does in truth deprive them of power to serve the government as they were intended to \n\n[232 U.S. 516, 526]\n\u00a0\n serve it, or does hinder the efficient exercise of their power. A tax upon their property has no such necessary effect. It leaves them free to discharge the duties they have undertaken to perform. A tax upon their operations is a direct obstruction to the exercise of Federal powers.'\n But we deem it entirely clear that a tax upon the exercise of the function of issuing municipal bonds is a tax upon the operations of the government, and not in any sense a tax upon the property of the municipality. And to tax the bonds as property in the hands of the holders is, in the last analysis, to impose a tax upon the right of the municipality to issue them. In Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 466, 468, 7 L. ed. 481, 487, 488, which involved the right of the city, acting under the authority of the state of South Carolina, to ordain a tax upon United States stock in the hands of the owner, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the court, after reaffirming the principles settled in M'Culloch v. Maryland, said (p. 468): 'The American people have conferred the power of borrowing money on their government, and by making that government supreme, have shielded its action, in the exercise of this power, from the action of the local governments. The grant of the power is incompatible with a restraining or controlling power, and the declaration of supremacy is a declaration that no such restraining or controlling power shall be exercised. The right to tax the contract to any extent, when made, must operate upon the power to borrow before it is exercised, and have a sensible influence on the contract. The extent of this influence depends on the will of a distinct government. To any extent, however inconsiderable, it is a burthen on the operations of government. It may be carried to an extent which shall arrest them entirely.'\n It is on this ground that United States bonds have always been held exempt from taxation under authority of the states. By like reasoning it has come to be recognized \n\n[232 U.S. 516, 527]\n\u00a0\n that bonds issued by the states are not taxable by the Federal government, and it was upon this ground that this court held, in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & T. Co. \n157 \nU.S. 429, 584\n, 39 S. L. ed. 759, 820, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 673, that the income tax provisions of the act of August 27, 1894 [28 Stat. at L. 509, chap. 349], were unconstitutional in that they imposed a tax upon the income derived from municipal bonds issued under the authority of the states.\n It is contended by defendant in error that the situation was changed by the admission of Oklahoma as a state, combining both the territory of Oklahoma and the Indian territory. This was accomplished under the enabling act of June 16, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 267, chap. 3335), and was evidenced by the proclamation of the President, issued November 16, 1907 [ 35 Stat. at L. 2160]. By  4 of art. I. of the Oklahoma Constitution the debts and liabilities of the territory of Oklahoma were assumed by the state.\n The argument is that at the time of making the assessment for taxes against plaintiff in error, the Indian territory and the territory of Oklahoma had ceased to exist as such for nearly six months, and that the bonds of the municipalities of those territories, being the obligations of the territorial government, were, by the Constitution, assumed by the state. There seems to be no provision of law that constitutes the bonds of the municipalities obligations of the territorial governments, and so the argument falls to the ground at once.\n But we are unwilling to intimate a concession that an assumption by the state of Oklahoma of the obligation to pay these bonds would operate to deprive the bondholders of the exemption from taxation, previously enjoyed. Presumably the municipal credit was enhanced and the terms of the municipal borrowing rendered more favorable, by the understanding that the bonds, being obligations of an agency of the Federal government, would be exempt from taxation by the several states. The value of the bonds in the market was presumably thereby in- \n\n[232 U.S. 516, 528]\n\u00a0\n creased. Indeed, the state court in the present case very plainly declares ( 114 Minn. 109, 130 N. W. 445, 851) that bonds of the municipalities of the territories, if not taxable by the state, command a higher price on the market than bonds of the municipalities of the states. To deprive bonds of the former description of their immunity from state taxation, and this because of the subsequent action of Congress in erecting the territories into a state, with or without an assumption by the new state of the obligations of the former Federal agency, would be in effect to impair the obligation of the contract; and this is so inconsistent with the honor and dignity of the United States that such an intent should not be presumed without the clearest legislative language requiring it.\n It is, however, further suggested that the judgment under review does not sustain a tax upon the bonds as property, but only a tax upon the surplus of the savings bank, computed by taking into the account all of its assets, amounting to about $12,000,000, of which the bonds were only about $700,000, and deducting therefrom its liabilities. But as the surplus is treated as property and taxed as such, it is obvious that some portion of the burden of the tax is attributable to the ownership of the municipal bonds. In New York ex rel. Bank of Commerce v. Tax & A. Comrs. 2 Black, 620, 17 L. ed. 451, it was held that the state of New York, in taxing the capital of banks according to its valuation, must leave out of the calculation that portion of the capital invested in the stocks, bonds, or other securities of the United States not liable to taxation by the state. And see Bank Tax Case (New York ex rel. Bank of Commonwealth v. Tax & A. Comrs.), 2 Wall. 200, 17 L. ed. 793; Home Sav. Bank v. Des Moines, \n205 \nU.S. 503, 509\n, 51 S. L. ed. 901, 906.\n It results that the inclusion of the bonds now in question in the list of the assets of plaintiff in error, in ascertaining its surplus for the purpose of imposing a state property tax thereon, was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. \n\n[232 U.S. 516, 529]\n\u00a0\n The second Federal question arises out of the insistence of the savings bank that it was entitled to have omitted from the computation of its surplus for purposes of taxation certain notes held by it, amounting to about $161,000, and secured by mortgages upon Minnesota real estate, upon which mortgages a registry tax had been paid.\n It appears that the Minnesota legislature, by chap. 328, Laws of 1907, provided a registry tax upon debts secured by mortgages covering real property in the state, the amount of the tax being 50 cents upon each $100, payable at or before the filing of the mortgage for record or registration. By  3 it was enacted that 'all mortgages upon which such tax has been paid, with the debts or obligations secured thereby and the papers evidencing the same, shall be exempt from all other taxes; but nothing herein shall exempt such property from the operation of the laws relating to the taxation of gifts and inheritances, or those governing the taxation of banks, savings banks, or trust companies;' with a further proviso not now pertinent.\n It was and is insisted that this section, in subjecting banks, savings banks, and trust companies to double taxation upon their mortgages covering real estate in the state of Minnesota, while at the same time relieving mortgages upon such real estate when otherwise owned, from all taxation except the registration tax, is in contravention of the 'equal protection' clause of the 14th Amendment.\n Although the clause limiting the exemption includes banks and trust companies, the supreme court of Minnesota declined to consider whether the classification was proper with respect to those institutions, and so declining dealt with the status of savings banks only. Holding that this class of institutions under other laws enjoyed privileges respecting taxation that were accorded to no other person or corporation subject to taxation, the court \n\n[232 U.S. 516, 530]\n\u00a0\n held that savings banks might properly be treated as a class by themselves, and required to include such mortgages in the computation of their assets for purposes of taxation.\n If there is no unconstitutional discrimination against savings banks, it is for present purposes unnecessary to inquire whether the act discriminates against other banks and trust companies.

L. ed. 212, 217, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 27.\n The supreme court of Minnesota lucidly summarized the state of the law which furnished, in its judgment, a sufficient reason for the classification, as follows: 'Section 839, Rev. Laws 1905, treats of savings banks, for the purposes of taxation, in a special manner. They have no capital stock, yet their property is not taxed in the same way as the property of individuals or of other corporations. By  838 the value of the stock of corporations having capital stock is ascertained by deducting the value of the real and personal property from the market or actual value of the stock, and the amount of the difference is taxed as stocks and bonds, and the real estate and personal property are taxed in the ordinary way. Section 839 places all banks without capital stock ( except savings banks), brokers, and stock jobbers in one class, and savings banks in another class. The former are taxed by ascertaining the difference between the amount of money on hand or in transit, the amount of money in the hands of others, subject to draft, the amount of checks or cash items, etc., the amount of bills receivable and other credits; and from the total of these amounts the deposits and accounts payable are deducted. The balance, if any, is assessed as money under  835. The bonds and stocks and personal and real property are assessed sep- \n\n[232 U.S. 516, 531]\n\u00a0\n arately in the ordinary way. But in the case of savings banks no specific property is taxed separately except real property. Its money, checks, bills receivable, bonds, and stocks, and all personal property appertaining to the business are listed for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is a surplus, and the surplus is found by deducting the total of the deposits and accounts payable from the total value of the costs.'\n For these and other reasons pointed out in the opinion, it seems to us the court was justified in holding that there was reasonable grounds for the discrimination so far as savings banks were concerned, and that plaintiff in error had therefore not been deprived of the equal protection of the laws. In lieu of further discussion we refer to the oft quoted language employed by Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for this court, in Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 33 S. L. ed. 892, 895, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 533.\n But because of the error in subjecting the bonds of the municipalities of the territories to taxation, the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","67":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFARRUGIA v.

William Clarke Mason and Charles Heebner for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an action against a railway company to recover for personal injuries. The right of action was predicated upon the Federal employers' liability act of April 22, 1908, 35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1322, as amended April 5, 1910, 36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1324, and it was alleged that the injuries were sustained while the defendant was engaged, and while the plaintiff was employed by it, in interstate commerce. There was a plea of not guilty, and a trial resulted in a judgment of compulsory nonsuit. The case is here upon a direct writ of error based upon a certificate that the court's decision was given upon a jurisdictional ground; namely, that 'the evidence produced at the trial of the case did not disclose that plaintiff, at the time of the happening of the accident by which he received the injuries complained of, was engaged in interstate commerce.'\n Although counsel have presented the case as if it were properly here, it is manifest that it is not. The clause in  238 of the Judicial Code [ 36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 228], providing for a direct writ of error 'in any case in which the jurisdiction of the court is in issue,' refers, as we have repeatedly held, to cases in which the power of the court, as a Federal court, to hear and determine the cause, is in controversy. Fore River Shipbuilding Co. v. Hagg, \n219 \nU.S. 175, 178\n, 55 S. L. ed. 163, 164, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 185; United States v. Congress Constr. Co. \n222 U.S. 199\n, 56 L. ed. 163, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44; R. J. Darnell v. Illinois C. R. Co. \n225 U.S. 243\n, 56 L. ed. 1072, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 760. No such issue is here disclosed. The power of the court, as a Federal court, to hear and determine the case, was not questioned. Nor did the court hold that it was without jurisdiction \n\n[233 U.S. 352, 354]\n\u00a0\n in that sense. On the contrary, it proceeded to a hearing and decided that the plaintiff could not recover under the Federal act because one element of his asserted cause of action was without any evidence to sustain it. Had the action been brought in a state court, as it could have been, the same question would have arisen; and had the evidence been similarly insufficient, a like decision must have ensued. We say the action could have been brought in a state court, because  6 of the Federal act declares: 'The jurisdiction of the courts of the United States under this act shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several states, and no case arising under this act and brought in any state court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the United States.' And we say the result must have been the same in a state court upon similar evidence, because the right of recovery given by the act ( 1) is restricted to injuries suffered while the employee is employed in interstate commerce.\n It follows that there was no basis for the direct writ of error. If a review of the decision was desired it should have been sought in the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","68":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFLORIDA EAST COAST R.

Boggs for intervening appellees.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The order of the Interstate Commerce Commission concerning which the appellant, hereafter called the East Coast Line, complained before the court below, and which that court refused to enjoin, was made on a second supplemental petition presented in controversies which had been long pending and twice before decided, such controversies involving many railroads, and being concerned with the rates as to pineapples, citrus fruits, and vegetables from places of production in Florida to exterior points of distribution or consumption. While the report here under consideration, made on the second supplemental petition, deals with only a few of the railroads concerned in the previous inquiries, and with only a part of the controversies involved in the previous cases, yet the reports in the previous cases and the reasons stated by the Commission for its action in those cases are so connected with its action complained of in this case that it is impossible to understand this controversy without recurring to and stating the previous reports of the Commission in the controversies to which we have referred. \n\n[234 U.S. 167, 174]\n\u00a0\n We observe before coming to make that statement that none of the testimony taken before the Commission in the cases prior to this one is in the record, it having been stipulated that the facts stated by the Commission in its reports in such previous cases should be taken as the facts of such controversies. For the purpose of the statement which we shall make, the record therefore consists of the reports in such previous cases, of the report in this case, and the testimony taken in this case before the Commission and in the court below. The future application of the facts which we shall state will be facilitated by giving a description of the East Coast Line as stated in the several reports of the Commission to which we shall immediately recur.\n The East Coast Line is wholly within the state of Florida, the main line extending from Jacksonville south along the Atlantic coast to Miami, a distance of 366 miles, then to Homestead, 28 miles south, and thence across the Florida Keys to Key West. At the time of the final hearing before the Commission on March 2, 1911, the road was not fully constructed, and was only completed and being operated to Knight's Key, about 83 miles below Homestead. The total mileage of the road was about 583 miles, including 477 miles of main line from Jacksonville to Knight's Key and about 106 miles of branch line above Miami. The cost of the construction from Homestead on was enormous, amounting to nearly $175,000 per mile, and the total cost of the extension from Homestead to Knight's Key, 83 miles, nearly equalled the entire cost of the balance of the road, 500 miles. On July 3, 1907, a petition was filed by the Florida Fruit & Vegetable Shippers' Protective Association against the Atlantic Coast Line, the Seaboard Air Line and Southern Railway Companies and the East Coast Line, complaining of and asking a reduction in interstate rates on pineapples, citrus fruits, and vegetables. The East Coast Line was the only one \n\n[234 U.S. 167, 175]\n\u00a0\n of the defendant railroads whose traffic was confined to the producing regions in Florida because, while the other lines also undoubtedly penetrated to the area of production, their lines were not confined to Florida, but were trunk lines, carrying not only the product committed to them by producers in Florida, but also the products committed by producers to roads like the East Coast Line, which did not extend beyond Florida, and had therefore to be transshipped if destined to points beyond the state by other roads. In coming to make its report in the case thus referred to, the Commission thus stated the general situation of the railroad traffic of all the roads in Florida concerning the subjects under discussion (No. 1168, 14 Inters. Com. Rep. 483):\n'The shape and location of the state of Florida is such that these railroads which handle this traffic from the point of production up to the base point necessarily do but a limited business. They extend south considerable distances through a sparsely settled country which neither originates nor consumes a considerable amount of traffic. Some of them reach the seacoast, but none of them connect or can connect with railroads leading beyond, and the amount of through business handled is extremely light. Their traffic is confined almost entirely to bringing out the products which originate upon their lines, and carrying in the supplies which are consumed in the territory served by them. Fruits and vegetables, lumber, naval stores, and in some cases cotton and phosphate rock are the principal commodities carried, and of these, fruits and vegetables produce the most revenue.'\n\n In the report by which the Commission disposed of this controversy ( No. 1168, 14 Inters. Com. Rep. 476) it divided the rates to be considered into two classes: (a) gathering charges from production points in Florida to base points of which Jacksonville was the only one on the East Coast Line, and (b) rates from base points to points of final \n\n[234 U.S. 167, 176]\n\u00a0\n destination in other states, the sum of the two rates being the joint through rate.\n Considering the three products whose traffic charges were under consideration, the Commission said:\n\n\n (a)\n Citrus fruits:\n'From an examination of the elaborate figures which were introduced upon the trial showing the character of the traffic handled by these Florida roads, the conditions under which it is handled, their earnings, and the cost of operation running through a series of years, it is difficult to see how these railroads can be expected to transport in a suitable way this fruit and vegetable traffic from points of production to these basing points for a less sum than they now receive. It is difficult to see how, even upon the present tariff, those lines can, in the immediate future, expect to pay any considerable return upon their investment. We feel that these local rates, although they are high in comparison with other local rates, are as low as should be established under all the circumstances.'\n\n\n (b)\n Vegetables:\n'The same observations which have been made upon the orange rates to base points apply with equal pertinency to those upon vegetables. They are named by the railroad commission of Florida. They are made with the understanding that they are really parts of through rates from the point of production to the market of consumption. They are low in comparison with other rates because it is understood that this industry is an important one to the state of Florida, and that a low cost of transportation is essential to its development.\n\n'While these local rates are essentially part of the through charge, and should be dealt with by this Commission as such, it is difficult to see how these Florida railroads can render a proper service upon a lower scale of rates than is now applied. It must be remembered that without the railroad this industry could not exist at all, and that \n\n[234 U.S. 167, 177]\n\u00a0\n to its satisfactory carrying on the character of the service is fully as important as the rate. It is better that these fruits and vegetables should reach the market on time, and in good condition, than that a few cents per box should be subtracted from the carrying charge. There was very little complaint as to the service; nor did the shippers who testified manifest any desire that these carriers should be required to accept less than reasonable compensation for that service. Our conclusion upon this branch of the case is that the present rates up to the base points, while high in comparison with similar rates in other localities, are as low as they ought to be under the conditions obtaining upon these Florida lines, so that here, as in case of oranges, the real question arises upon the rate from the base point to the northern market.'\n\n\n (c)\n Pineapples:\n'Pineapples are mainly produced in Florida, upon the line of the Florida East Coast Railway, which extends, as already said, down the east side of Florida. This industry has, within recent years, developed rapidly. Florida pineapples to-day sell in all the markets of the United States in competition with foreign pineapples, usually commanding much higher prices than the foreign article. While the period of production in the United States and in Cuba is not exactly the same, still it may fairly be said that the two products do compete.\n\n'It was said that Jansen might be selected as a typical producing point upon the Florida East Coast Railway. This station is 257 miles south of Jacksonville, and the rate on pineapples is 24 cents per box of 80 pounds. Rates from other points are relatively about the same as from Jansen; somewhat lower, it will be seen, for the same distance, than from most producing points upon oranges.'\n\n Presumably, deeming that the particular situation on the East Coast Line as to the character of its business, its \n\n[234 U.S. 167, 178]\n\u00a0\n location, its cost, etc., etc., required to be specially pointed out in addition to what was said in the passages quoted, the Commission said:\n'The Florida East Coast Railway was built as part of a hotel scheme, and its principal business is the carrying of passengers who frequent these Florida winter resorts. Over 50 per cent of its total receipts are from passenger traffic. Its most important freight business is the transportation of fruits and vegetables, and of these pineapples afford the most considerable amount of revenue. The management of the railroad has paid great attention to the development of this business. In the pineapples region highways are few and transportation by wagon is therefore costly. To relieve this difficulty sidings have been put in the pineapple region at frequent intervals. The traffic representative of this railroad stated that it was possible to load pineapples every half mile upon his line in the pineapple-producing region. When once loaded, great attention is paid to sending the fruit to Jacksonville upon a reliable and expeditious schedule.\n\n'Very elaborate tables were introduced, showing the cost of constructing this railroad and the financial results of its past operations. These statements and tables have been examined by the Commission, but it does not seem necessary to reproduce them here, or to state in detail the grounds of our conclusions. But for this railroad the pineapple industry in Florida would not to-day exist. The quality of the service rendered that industry by this road is not criticized. The shippers of this fruit ought not to object, nor do they object, to paying a fair compensation for the service, and in our opinion the present rates do not exceed such just compensation for the transportation of pineapples from various producing points to Jacksonville, and we so hold.'\n\n And concerning the earnings of the East Coast Line, it was said: \n\n[234 U.S. 167, 179]\n\u00a0\n 'The total earnings of the Florida East Coast Railway for the same year [ending June 30, 1907] were $5,911 per mile, and its operating expenses $4,502. The greater part of the receipts of this railroad are from its passenger service. The evidence shows that a considerable portion of what little freight revenue it has comes from the transportation of fruits and vegetables. It has given in the past great attention to this service, and has apparently satisfied its patrons in this respect. It makes no through rates, but receives its full local in all cases up to Jacksonville.'\n Giving effect to the foregoing, the Commission held that the complaint as to gathering charges was wholly unfounded, and they were maintained. A different conclusion, however, was reached as to charges from the base points to points of distribution or consumption, as to which some reduction was made. It consequently follows that all the other roads who were defendants were subjected to some reduction as to their rates, while the East Coast Line, because of its being a purely gathering road, was subjected to no reduction whatever.\n Within a year after this action by the Commission the same complainant commenced a new proceeding (No. 2566) against two hundred railroads, including, among others, the East Coast Line, to establish carload rates from base points in Florida to interstate points. At the same time in No. 1168, which, as we have seen, had been previously passed upon by the Commission and decided in favor of the East Coast Line, a supplemental petition was filed against that road, the sole complaint against the East Coast Line in such petitions being as to its gathering rates on pineapples from points of production to Jacksonville. And it is to be presumed that the complaint as to pineapple-gathering rates was made only against the East Coast Line, because, as we have seen, as stated by the Commission, that road was almost the exclusive carrier of such \n\n[234 U.S. 167, 180]\n\u00a0\n product, and in fact had virtually built up that industry. The controversy, while it involved a claim of reduction, in its broad aspect presented only a controversy as to whether there should be put in force carload and less- than-carload instead of anyquantity rates in the performance of its duty of gathering pineapples. On the filing of the new and original as well as of the supplemental petition, the Commission directed the rescinding of its previous order concerning the reasonableness of gathering rates, as well as its finding on the subject of rates from base points, and directed the matter to be reheard. Without referring to the conclusion of the Commission concerning the controversy as to the many railroads who were before it as to their interstate rates, we come to state the ruling of the Commission as to the East Coast Line (17 Inters. Com. Rep. 552):\n'The evidence produced upon the present hearing suggests no change in what was said so far as that applies to the Florida East Coast Railway. That line operates at the present time 477 miles of main line and 106 miles of branches. It has a first mortgage of $10,000,000, a second mortgage of $20,000,000, and a capital stock of $3,000,000, making in all $ 33,000,000. This capitalization, with the exception of about $4,000,000, represents an actual cash investment.\n\n'It is urged by the complainant that the portion of the line from Miami south, which has cost some $14,000,000, was not at the present time a paying investment, and that the balance of the line from Jacksonville to Miami, which is used by the growers of pineapples, ought not to be taxed with the cost of this construction. Admitting this to be so, and laying out of view altogether the $14,000,000 which have been invested in that part of the property, it is still true that, during the entire existence of the Florida East Coast Railway, so far as this record shows, that property has never earned in any single year 6 per cent upon the money invested, with the single exception of the year 1909. \n\n[234 U.S. 167, 181]\n\u00a0\n During much of the time its net earnings have been but little above its operating expenses. We certainly cannot hold that these rates should be reduced because for a single twelve months, under what may be termed abnormal conditions, this railway earned about 6 per cent on the money which has been actually invested in its construction. The years when no return has been received must certainly be given some consideration. Upon no other theory could private capital be induced to invest in the construction of railroads.\n\n'While, however, we adhere to what was said in the previous case, we do think, upon more careful examination, that these rates of the Florida East Coast Railway on pineapples ought to be somewhat revised. They are not consistent with one another, and in our opinion those from the more distant points are too high as compared with rates from nearby points.\n\n'The present rates are in any quantity. About 60 per cent of these pineapples move from the point of origin in carloads, 40 per cent in less than carloads. Carload shipments are stripped and loaded by the shipper, and are not unloaded at Jacksonville, which probably saves the carrier not far from 2 cents per box. The less-than-carload shipment is loaded by the railway and usually unloaded at the station in South Jacksonville or Jacksonville. In our opinion carload rates should be established which are less than the present any-quantity rates by 3 cents per box.\n\n'The establishment of such carload rates will not of a certainty work a decrease in the net earnings of the carriers. It is a false theory of transportation which seeks to force the shipper to avail himself of a less- than-carload service, which is more expensive to render, for the purpose of increasing the gross revenues of the carrier. The true object should be to perform the service in the most economical manner, and to charge for that service reasonable compensation. In the end this makes to the advan- \n\n[234 U.S. 167, 182]\n\u00a0\n tage of both the carrier and its patron. The vice president of the Florida East Coast Railway stated that he had always thought that carload rates should be established, and that, in his opinion, to establish carload rates, 3 cents per box less than the present any-quantity rates would not prejudice the net revenues of his company, since he would make up by saving in operating expenses what he lost in gross income.'\n\n The order of the Commission which gave effect to these views entered February 8, 1910, changed gathering charges on pineapples and citrus fruits on the East Coast Line from any-quantity to carload and less-than- carload rates, and modified the mileage basis. On attention being directed to the fact that the complaint related only to pineapples, while the order applied to that product and to citrus fruits, the order was modified and restricted to the subject complained of,-pineapples. The East Coast Line conformed to the order, and, indeed, shortly after doing so, also voluntarily put into effect carload and less-than-carload gathering rates on citrus fruits and vegetables, and although the rates thus fixed were somewhat higher than the rates on pineapples which the Commission had established, they were lower than the citrus fruit and vegetable rates which had been expressly sustained by the Commission.\n Some months after this was done the same complainant who had filed the previous petitions presented in No. 1168 a second supplemental complaint against the East Coast Line, and new petitions against the Seaboard Air Line and Atlantic Coast Line Railways (No. 3808). So far as the East Coast Line was concerned, the complaint was against the citrus fruit and vegetablegathering rates, and asked that they be equalized with or made the same as the pineapple rate. The Florida Railroad Commission intervened and asked the same relief. The Commission in effect granted the prayer of this second supplemental complaint, found the rates of the East Coast Line on \n\n[234 U.S. 167, 183]\n\u00a0\n citrus fruits and vegetables to be unjust and unreasonable, and directed the putting into operation of a lower stated schedule of gathering rates which was made applicable not only to the East Coast Line, but also to the other roads which were parties to the proceeding. And it is this order which the railroad refused to obey, and to enjoin the enforcement of which this suit was brought.\n Without going into detail, it suffices to say that the report of the Commission concerning the action just stated did not purport to question the correctness of its previous findings sustaining the citrus fruit and vegetable rates of the East Coast Line, but was based upon what was deemed to be a change in conditions since the previous decisions. After pointing out that it had previously ordered a change from any-quantity to carload and less-than-carload rates on pineapples from gathering points to the base point on the East Coast Line, and on all fruits and vegetables from base points outward, and that on both the Atlantic Coast Line and the Seaboard Air Line anyquantity rates yet remained from gathering points as to all fruits and vegetables, although such was not the case as to the East Coast Line, because of the change which it had voluntarily made, it was said (22 Inters. Com. Rep. 11, 14-16):\n'No material change has taken place since then [that is, since the previous decisions], so far as this record discloses, which would lead to a different conclusion if the same subject were before us to-day. The volume of business transacted has increased, but the expenses of operation have also increased to an extent which offsets the greater amount of business.\n\n ... * *\n'It appeared in the original case that citrus fruits to some extent, and vegetables to a much greater extent, were shipped in small lots to Jacksonville, and there reloaded for movement beyond. It was our impression that, in \n\n[234 U.S. 167, 184]\n\u00a0\n establishing carload rates from the base point, that this would permit the movement in small lots up to the base point and the consolidation at such point, and that the carload movement would in fact be mainly beyond the base point. Such has not been the result. In order to obtain the carload rate beyond the base point it seems to be necessary for the shipper, in actual practice, to present a full carload at the point of origin, and from this it follows that the movement up to the base point at the present time is entirely different from what it was when we approved these any- quantity rates. At that time the loading was by the carrier; now it is mainly by the shipper. The loading of the cars from the point of origin to the base points is much heavier now than formerly. In 1907 the average loading of citrus fruits and pineapples upon the Atlantic Coast Line up to the base point was 215 boxes. In 1910 this loading had increased to 279 boxes. In case of vegetables the increase is even more marked. The number of cars now required to transport the same amount of this traffic from points of origin to base points would be materially less than in 1908. Otherwise stated, it costs the shipper more to handle his business to-day and it costs the railroad less.'\n\n And upon that changed circumstance an order was awarded directing the change from any-quantity to carload and less-than-carload, and fixing a rate which was the same as that previously fixed for pineapples. Of course, as the East Coast Line had voluntarily put in carload and less-than- carload rates, it was only affected by this order to the extent that it lowered the traffic charge as contained in the schedule which had been previously voluntarily established.\n It is insisted that the order of the Commission was wrongful, and that the court below erred in not restraining its enforcement for the following reasons: (a) because the order complained of was rendered without any evidence \n\n[234 U.S. 167, 185]\n\u00a0\n whatever to sustain it; (b) because it confiscated the property of the railway in a twofold aspect; first, by fixing a rate so unreasonably low as to afford no remuneration to the corporation for the use of its property; and second, because, although the Commission, in order to justify the rate which it fixed, took into account the revenue derived from the extended road, it nevertheless declined to at all consider the value of the extended road and the right to earn a return thereon. We come as briefly as possible to consider these contentions separately.\n\n\n (a)\n That there was no evidence whatever tending to sustain the reduction of the rates on citrus fruits and vegetables as to the East Coast Line which the Commission ordered.\n While a finding of fact made by the Commission concerning a matter within the scope of the authority delegated to it is binding, and may not be re-examined in the courts, it is undoubted that where it is contended that an order whose enforcement is resisted was rendered without any evidence whatever to support it, the consideration of such a question involves not an issue of fact, but one of law, which it is the duty of the courts to examine and decide. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & N. R. Co. \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 92 S., 57 L. ed. 431, 433, 434, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 185, and cases cited.\n In view of what we have said concerning the state of the record, the solution of the question must depend upon an examination and analysis of two subjects: the one, the reports of the Commission in the previous cases, and the other, the testimony which was before it and the report made in this case. As to the first, in view of the statements made by the Commission in its report in the original case (No. 1168, 14 Inters. Com. Rep. 476) as to the earning power of the road, the nature of its business, and the reasonableness of its rates, and the express finding that the citrus fruit and vegetable rates were just and reasonable and should not be changed, and the further fact that they were not called in question in the second proceeding, it \n\n[234 U.S. 167, 186]\n\u00a0\n follows that the inquiry narrows itself to the mere consideration of the testimony taken in this proceeding, and the report of the Commission in such proceeding, and the testimony taken before the court below in so far as it is proper to consider it in connection with the particular question under consideration. But, coming to make a review of the testimony before the Commission on the issue raised by the second supplemental petition, we fail to find the slightest proof tending to sustain the reduction in rates as to the East Coast Line, which was made.\n There are only three subjects referred to in the testimony which can in any view be considered as having any possible tendency to show such a change as would cause the rate which was found by the Commission in the past reasonable, and not to justify a change, to be unreasonable and therefore require reduction. The three subjects are these: (a) testimony by the chairman of the Florida Railroad Commission that there had been a considerable increase in the volume of traffic in citrus fruits and vegetables since the previous finding; (b) a further statement or admission made by an officer of the East Coast Line in a colloquy which took place at the hearing in this case, to the effect that, as shippers under carload rates loaded their own cars, there was some difference in cost, to the advantage of the road over the cost of loading when the any- quantity rates prevailed; (c) testimony with reference to the Atlantic Coast Line and the Seaboard Air Line (but none as to the East Coast Line), to the effect that on those roads it had come to pass that there was a saving in expense and an increase in earning capacity because, even under the any-quantity rates, carload shipments had greatly increased, and cars so shipped were much more heavily loaded and moved from the point of production through the base point to their ultimate destination, when such was not the case at the time the previous order was made. Testimony which, as we have seen, was expressly \n\n[234 U.S. 167, 187]\n\u00a0\n declared by the Commission to be in effect the cause which gave rise to the reduction. But at once it is to be observed that, so far as any inference alone from the difference between carload and less-than-carload rates and any-quantity rates is concerned, it had no application to the East Coast Line, since that road had put in the carload and less-than- carload rates while the other two roads had not. And so far as the consideration of the increased loading is concerned, as stated by the Commission, whatever may have been the proof as to the Seaboard Air Line and the Atlantic Coast Line, it is beyond controversy that no such proof can be found in the record as to the East Coast Line except the vague intimation to which we have referred.\n Thus, by analysis, the case comes to this: Did the facts as to the increased loading which the Commission found to exist in the case of the Seaboard Air Line and the Atlantic Coast Line support or tend to support the order as to the East Coast Line in the absence of all testimony in the record concerning the existence of such fact as to the traffic on that road? In other words, the question is, Because there was testimony as to the traffic of those roads, can such testimony be said to tend to establish the same condition on the East Coast Line? Conceding that, from an abstract point of view, an affirmative answer would have to be given to such question, we think such is not the case here for the following reasons: (a) because of the difference in business carried on by the two roads named and the East Coast Line, they being not only gatherers of the local product, but trunk line carriers; (b) because of the difference in the situation and traffic of the two trunk lines named and the East Coast Line, as deduced solely from the peculiar environment and movement of business on that road so aptly stated in the passages from the reports of the Commission which we have quoted. Differences which presumably gave rise to \n\n[234 U.S. 167, 188]\n\u00a0\n separate statements in the previous reports in considering that road. While we do not say that the conclusion is affirmatively sustained, nevertheless we think the state of the record at least tends to give some support to the suggestion in the argument that the greater magnitude and importance of the consideration of the business and rates of the two trunk line carriers concentrated attention in that direction, and therefore caused the inquiry on that subject and the facts concerning the same to eclipse the distinctions between those lines and the East Coast Line,- distinctions which, if otherwise taken under consideration, should have produced a different result.\n As it follows from these views that the order in question as to the East Coast Line and its enforcement should have been enjoined by the court below, our duty is to reverse the action of that court, and to remand the case to the proper district court, with directions to grant the prayer of the East Coast Line, and restrain the enforcement of the order in question; and it is so ordered.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFRANKLIN v. LYNCH(1914)\nNo. 553\nArgued: Decided: April 6, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 269, 270]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. A. Ledbetter for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. S. T. Bledsoe for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar delivered the opinion of the court:\n Emmer Sisney, a white woman and widow of a Choctaw Indian, applied in 1899 to be admitted as a member of the tribe by intermarriage. Her application not having been granted, she employed Franklin & Apple, attorneys at law, to secure her enrolment. As compensation for their services she, on October 16, 1905, by warranty deed, conveyed to them her 'entire interest in any and all lands, exclusive of homestead, which might finally be allotted to her by the Commissioners of the Five Civilized Tribes.' This deed was duly recorded, together with an instrument by which she agreed to make conveyance when the land was actually allotted. Thereafter, on November 26, 1906, Emmer Sisney was enrolled as an intermarried citizen of the Choctaw Nation. She promptly made her selection, and on December 12, 1906, received a patent to land, all of which, except the homestead, she, on December 14, 1906, sold for value to Lynch & Simmons. Thereupon Franklin, who had acquired Apple's interest under the deed of 1905, brought this suit to have the deed to Lynch & Simmons canceled as a cloud on his title. The district court of Oklahoma entered a decree in his favor. That judgment was reversed by the supreme court, and the case is here on a writ of error to review that ruling.\n Both parties claim title to land allotted in December, 1906, to a white member of the Choctaw Tribe. The plaintiff has the older warranty deed, but the defendants contend that as it was signed before allotment, the deed was void by virtue of the provisions in the Supplemental Agreement of July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 641,  15 and 16, chap. 1362), \n\n[233 U.S. 269, 271]\n\u00a0\n that 'lands allotted to members and freedmen [of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Tribes] shall not be affected . . . by any deed, debt, or obligation of any character contracted prior to the time at which said land may be alienated under this act, nor shall said lands be sold except . . . ( 16) after issuance of patent.'\n To this the plaintiff replies that as Emmer Sisney was a white woman, this prohibition against sale by her had been repealed by the act of April 21, 1904 (33 Stat. at L. 204, chap. 1402), which provides that 'all the restrictions upon the alienation of lands of all allottees of . . . the Five Civilized Tribes of Indians, who are not of Indian blood, . . . are . . . hereby removed.'\n That statute did not authorize white members of the tribe to sell future acquired property, but did permit non-Indian allottees to sell what had been actually assigned to them in severalty. Cf. 34 Stat. at L.  19, p. 144, chap. 1876. The distinction between a member and an allottee is not verbal, but was made in recognition of a definite policy in reference to these lands. The Revised Statutes ( 2118) declare that no conveyance from an Indian tribe shall be of any validity in law or in equity unless authorized by treaty. As the tribe could not sell, neither could the individual members, for they had neither an undivided interest in the tribal land nor vendible interest in any particular tract. Gritts v. Fisher, \n224 U.S. 641\n, 56 L. ed. 931, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 580. But in pursuance of the legislation following the Report of the Dawes Commission ( Choate v. Trapp, \n224 U.S. 665\n, 56 L. ed. 941, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 565), provision was made for dividing and distributing the tribal land in severalty among the members of the tribe. But, recognizing the probability of improvident and hasty sales being made, Congress provided that the land could not be sold until after the patent had actually issued, and even then only one quarter could be sold in one year, three quarters in three years, and the balance in five years. The act of 1904, relied on by plaintiff, removed some of the re- \n\n[233 U.S. 269, 272]\n\u00a0\n strictions, and permitted those members of the tribe who were not of Indian blood to sell land after it had been actually allotted in severalty. But it did not permit even a non-Indian to sell a mere float or expectancy, since he would not likely receive the full value of what thereafter might be patented to him.\n The plaintiff further contends that even if the deed was inoperative when made, yet, as Emmer Sisney was a white woman, she had the capacity of a white person of full age to convey an expectancy, so that when she acquired title in 1906 it inured to the benefit of Franklin and Apple, as the grantees under the deed of 1905. But the trouble with this contention is that Emmer Sisney cannot be treated as a white woman for the purpose of conveying an expectancy, and an Indian for the purpose of securing an allotment. When she applied to be enrolled as a citizen of the Choctaw Nation she, ipso facto, subjected herself to the retriction upon alienation of Indian land imposed upon all members of the tribe. All who dealt with her, as to land thereafter allotted to her, were charged with knowledge that the act of 1902 declared that such land should not be affected by any contract made before allotment. The deed of 1905 was therefore a nullity, and did not estop her or her assigns from showing that it had been made in direct violation of the statute. For, to permit an Indian's deed, void when made, to operate as a conveyance of title to lands subsequently allotted, would be to disregard the express language of the statute and defeat the protective purposes for which the law was passed. Starr v. Long Jim, \n227 U.S. 624\n, 57 L. ed. 675, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 358. The result is not changed by the provision of  642 of Mansfield's Digest that 'if a person, without title, shall convey real estate, and subsequently acquire title, the legal or equitable estate afterwards acquired shall immediately pass to the grantee as if the estate had been in the grantor at the time of the conveyance.' The chapter of Mansfield's Digest of \n\n[233 U.S. 269, 273]\n\u00a0\n Arkansas Law containing this section was extended (32 Stat. at L. 841, chap. 707) to the Indian territory 'so far as the same may be applicable and not inconsistent with any law of Congress.' It has no effect here because it is inconsistent with the act of 1902, which declared that Indian land should not be affected by a deed made before patent. The deed to Franklin, having been made before allotment, was void, and the judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","70":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGARLAND v. STATE OF WASHINGTON(1914)\nNo. 226\nArgued: Decided: March 16, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. William H. Gorham, O. L. Willett, and Frank Oleson for plaintiff in error. \n\n[232 U.S. 642, 643]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Hugh M. Caldwell, John F. Murphy, and H. B. Butler for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error was convicted in the superior court of King county, Washington, upon an information charging him with larceny of 'a check payable for the sum of $1,000 in money.' Upon appeal the conviction was affirmed by the supreme court of Washington (65 Wash. 666, 118 Pac. 907), and the case comes here upon writ of error.\n It appears that a previous information had charged the accused with the larceny of 'one thousand dollars ($1,000) in lawful money of the United States.' Upon that information he was arraigned, entered a plea of not guilty, was tried and convicted. A new trial was awarded, and \n\n[232 U.S. 642, 644]\n\u00a0\n thereafter the second information was filed, making the charge as above stated. Before trial the plaintiff in error filed a 'motion directed to second information,' containing a motion to quash, a motion to strike out, and a motion to make more definite and certain, all of which were denied. No arraignment or plea was had upon that information. The case having been called for trial and the jury having been impaneled, the plaintiff in error, by his counsel, objected to the introduction of any evidence upon the ground that the state had no right to try the plaintiff in error on the information then before the court. This general objection was overruled. No specific objection was taken before the trial to the want of formal arraignment upon the second information. The jury, at the conclusion of the trial upon the second information, returned a verdict of guilty, and sentence was passed upon the plaintiff in error.\n It is apparent that the accused was tried and convicted upon an information charging an offense against the law; that he had a jury trial, with full opportunity to be heard, and that he was in fact deprived of no right or privilege in the making of his defense, unless such deprivation arises from the fact that he was not arraigned and required to plead to the second information before trial. The object of arraignment being to inform the accused of the charge against him and obtain an answer from him was fully subserved in this case, for the accused had taken objections to the second information, and was put to trial before a jury upon that information in all respects as though he had entered a formal plea of not guilty. In this view, the supreme court of Washington, following its former decisions, held that the failure to enter the plea had deprived the accused of no substantial right, and that having failed to make objection upon that ground before trial, it was waived and could not be subsequently taken. This ruling, it is contended, deprived the plaintiff in error of his liberty \n\n[232 U.S. 642, 645]\n\u00a0\n without due process of law within the meaning of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.\n Due process of law, this court has held, does not require the state to adopt any particular form of procedure, so long as it appears that the accused has had sufficient notice of the accusation and an adequate opportunity to defend himself in the prosecution. Rogers v. Peck, \n199 \nU.S. 425, 435\n, 50 S. L. ed. 256, 260, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 87, and previous cases in this court there cited. Tried by this test it cannot for a moment be maintained that the want of formal arraignment deprived the accused of any substantial right, or in any wise changed the course of trial to his disadvantage. All requirements of due process of law in criminal trials in a state, as laid down in the repeated decisions of this court, were fully met by the proceedings had against the accused in the trial court. The objection was merely a formal one, was not included in the general language in which the objection to the introduction of evidence was interposed before the trial, and was evidently reserved with a view to the use which is now made of it, in an attempt to gain a new trial for want of compliance with what in this case could have been no more than a mere formality.\n It is insisted, however, that this court in the case of Crain v. United States, \n162 U.S. 625\n, 40 L. ed. 1097, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 952, held the contrary. In that case the question was specifically made as to the necessity of a plea before trial, duly entered of record. The learned justice who spoke for the majority of the court announced its conclusion approving a number of early cases in the state courts which had held that such form of arraignment entered of record was essential to a legal trial, and holding that in a Federal court no valid trial could be had without the requisite arraignment and plea, and that such must be shown by the record of conviction. If a legal trial cannot be had without a plea to the indictment, duly entered of record before trial, it would follow that such omission in the present case requires a reversal \n\n[232 U.S. 642, 646]\n\u00a0\n of the judgment of conviction, because the prisoner has been deprived of due process of law.\n Technical objections of this character were undoubtedly given much more weight formerly than they are now. Such rulings originated in that period of English history when the accused was entitled to few rights in the presentation of his defense, when he could not be represented by counsel, nor heard upon his own oath, and when the punishment of offenses, even of a trivial character, was of a severe and often of a shocking nature. Under that system the courts were disposed to require that the technical forms and methods of procedure should be fully complied with. But with improved methods of procedure and greater privileges to the accused, any reason for such strict adherence to the mere formalities of trial would seem to have passed away, and we think that the better opinion, when applied to a situation such as now confronts us, was expressed in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Peckham, speaking for the minority of the court in the Crain Case, when he said (p. 649):\n'Here the defendant could not have been injured by an inadvertence of that nature. He ought to be held to have waived that which, under the circumstances, would have been a wholly unimportant formality. A waiver ought to be conclusively implied where the parties had proceeded as if defendant had been duly arraigned, and a formal plea of not guilty had been interposed, and where there was no objection made on account of its absence until, as in this case, the record was brought to this court for review. It would be inconsistent with the due administration of justice to permit a defendant under such circumstances to lie by, say nothing as to such an objection, and then for the first time urge it in this court.'\n\n Holding this view, notwithstanding our reluctance to overrule former decisions of this court, we now are constrained to hold that the technical enforcement of formal \n\n[232 U.S. 642, 647]\n\u00a0\n rights in criminal procedure sustained in the Crain Case is no longer required in the prosecution of offenses under present systems of law, and so far as that case is not in accord with the views herein expressed, it is necessarily overruled.\n The other objection to the procedure in the state court which it is alleged deprived the plaintiff in error of due process of law upon his trial, rests in the contention that he was put to trial upon two informations, containing different charges, without notice as to which charge he would be required to meet, and sentenced upon a general verdict of guilty. We think that the record discloses that there is nothing in this objection of substantial merit, and that it appears that the accused was put to trial and convicted upon the second information, with every opportunity to defend himself against the offense therein charged.\n Judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington is accordingly affirmed. \n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGARRETT v. LOUISVILLE & N. R. CO.(1914)\nNo. 81\nArgued: Decided: November 30, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 308, 309]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John A. Pitts and H. N. Leech for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 308, 310]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John B. Keeble for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action for damages under the employers' liability act, approved April 22, 1908 (35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1322), was originally brought in the state court March 31, 1910. It was removed to the circuit court of the United States, middle district of Tennessee, and tried there in May, 1911. The declaration contains three counts, each of which \n\n[235 U.S. 308, 311]\n\u00a0\n alleges that plaintiff is the administrator of T. W. Lewis, Jr., by appointment of the county court, Stewart county, Tennessee; defendant is a Kentucky railroad corporation engaged in interstate commerce; in September, 1909, the deceased was employed as a brakeman on one of its freight trains moving in such commerce; through negligence of its operatives and servants a collision occurred; in an effort to save his life he was caught under the engine and held there for six hours or more, suffering intense agony and pain, followed shortly by death; he was twenty-four years of age, strong, vigorous, with fine business qualifications and earning capacity. The first and second counts allege that the deceased left surviving T. W. Lewis, his father, and Mrs. T. W. Lewis, his mother, and that 'plaintiff, as administrator of the said intestate, sues the defendant, for the benefit of his parents, in the sum of $50,000 damages.' The third count alleges the survival of not only father and mother, but also brothers and sisters (the names of the latter not being given), and that 'plaintiff, as administrator of the said decedent, sues the defendant in the sum of $50, 000 damages.'\n The trial judge, having definitely offered the plaintiff on opportunity to amend his declaration, which was declined, excluded all evidence relating to the mental and physical suffering of the deceased, and also all tending to show pecuniary loss sustained by the parents; and then peremptorily instructed the jury to return a verdict for defendant. The United States circuit court of appeals tendered a further opportunity to amend, and, when this was rejected, affirmed the judgment of the trial court (117 C. C. A. 109, 197 Fed. 715, 3 N. C. C. A. 769). The cause is here upon writ of error.\n The questions presented are: First, whether, under the employers' liability act of 1908 (before amendment of April 5, 1910 [36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1324]), the administrator of one who died of painful injuries suffered while employed in interstate commerce \n\n[235 U.S. 308, 312]\n\u00a0\n by a railroad engaging therein can recover damages for the benefit of the estate (third count); and, second, whether, if such administrator sue for the benefit of the employee's parents, there being no surviving widow or husband or child, it is necessary to allege facts or circumstances tending to show that, as a result of the death, they suffered pecuniary loss ( first and second counts).\n The nature of the rights and responsibilities arising out of this act has been discussed and determined in four opinions announced by this court since the instant cause was decided by the circuit court of appeals. Michigan C. R. Co. v. Vreeland, \n227 U.S. 59\n, 57 L. ed. 417, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 192, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 176; American R. Co. v. Didricksen, \n227 U.S. 145\n, 57 L. ed. 456, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 224; Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. McGinnis, \n228 U.S. 173\n, 57 L. ed. 785, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 426, 3 N. C. C. A. 806; North Carolina R. Co. v. Zachary, \n232 U.S. 248\n, 58 L. ed. 591, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 305, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 159. It is now definitely settled that the act declared two distinct and independent liabilities resting upon the common foundation of a wrongful injury: (1) liability to the injured employee for which he alone can recover; and (2), in case of death, liability to his personal representative 'for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children,' and if none, then of the parents, which extends only to the pecuniary loss and damage resulting to them by reason of the death.\n The third count of the declaration under consideration states no cause of action. The employee's right to recover for injuries did not survive him.\n Where any fact is necessary to be proved in order to sustain the plaintiff's right of recovery, the declaration must contain an averment substantially of such fact in order to let in the proof. Every issue must be founded upon some certain point, so that the parties may come prepared with their evidence, and not be taken by surprise, and the jury may not be misled by the introduction of various matters. Bank of United States v. Smith, 11 Wheat. 171, 174, 6 L. ed. 443, 444; Minor v. Mechanics' Bank, 1 Pet. 46, 67, 7 L. ed. 47, 56; De \n\n[235 U.S. 308, 313]\n\u00a0\n Luca v. Hughes, 96 Fed. 923, 925; Rose v. Perry, 8 Yerg. 156; Citizens' Street R. Co. v. Burke, 98 Tenn. 650, 40 S. W. 1085, 2 Am. Neg. Rep. 459; 1 Chitty, Pl. *270. Although the same precision of statement is not required as in pleadings at law, nevertheless it is held to be absolutely necessary that in bills of equity such a convenient degree of certainty should be adopted as may serve to give the defendant full information of the case which he is called upon to answer. Every bill must contain in itself sufficient matters of fact, per se, to maintain the plaintiff's case; and if the proofs go to matters not set up therein the court cannot judicially act upon them as a ground for decision, for the pleadings do not put them in contestation. Harrison v. Nixon, 9 Pet. 483, 503, 9 L. ed. 201, 208; Dan. Ch. Pl. & Pr. *368.\n The plaintiff's declaration contains no positive averment of pecuniary loss to the parents for whose benefit the suit was instituted. Nor does it set out facts or circumstances adequate to apprise the defendant with reasonable particularity the such loss in fact was suffered. Common experience teaches that financial damage to a parent by no means follows as a necessary consequence upon the death of an adult son. The plaintiff expressly declined in both courts below so to amend his declaration as to allege pecuniary loss to the parents; and judgment properly went against him.\n The request is now made that, in view of all the circumstances, especially the former undetermined meaning of the statute, this court remand the cause for a new trial upon the declaration being so amended as to include the essential allegation. But we do not think such action would be proper. The courts below committed no error of which just complaint can be made here; and the rights of the defendant must be given effect, notwithstanding the unusual difficulties and uncertainties with which counsel for the plaintiff found himself confronted.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","72":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGAUTHIER v. MORRISON(1914)\nNo. 157\nArgued: December 19, 1913Decided: February 24, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 452, 453]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Fred B. Morrill, W. C. Jones, L. F. Chester, and John J. Skuse for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Reese H. Voorhees for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 452, 456]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case originated in the superior court of Spokane county, Washington, and involves the present right of possession of a tract of unsurveyed public land, containing about 75 acres, in that county.\n Considerably abridged, the facts stated in the complaint are these: In 1877, when the public lands in that vicinity were surveyed, an area embracing approximately 1,200 acres was, by the wrongful act or error of the surveyor, omitted from the survey and meandered as a lake, when in truth it was not such, but was agricultural land susceptible of cultivation. That area still remains unsurveyed and includes the tract in question. On October 30, 1909, this tract was unappropriated public land, open to settlement under the homestead law of the United States. On that day the plaintiff, being in every way qualified so to do, made actual settlement upon the tract with the purpose of acquiring the title under that law by a full and bona fide compliance with its requirements, and, in furtherance of that purpose, erected upon the tract a habitable frame dwelling, furnished the same with all necessary household goods, entered into possession of the tract, and established \n\n[232 U.S. 452, 457]\n\u00a0\n his actual residence thereon. Shortly thereafter, during the continuance of his possession and residence, the defendants, with the wrongful purpose of preventing him from complying with the requirements of the homestead law, and of subjecting the tract to their own use, unlawfully compelled him to withdraw therefrom and remain away; and when the action was commenced, a few months later, they were wrongfully withholding the tract from him, and were themselves mere trespassers thereon. It also was alleged: 'That in order to comply with the requirements of the homestead law of the United States, and to acquire title to the land so settled upon by this plaintiff, as aforesaid, under said law, it becomes and is necessary for this plaintiff to reside upon and cultivate such land, and to have possession thereof for a period of five years; and unless this plaintiff can reside upon, cultivate, and have possession of said land for and during such period of time from and after his said settlement, this plaintiff cannot comply with the requirements of the homestead law of the United States, and sustain and maintain his rights to said land, and acquire title thereto from the government of the United States under the homestead law of the United States.' The prayer was for a judgment establishing the plaintiff's right to the possession, declaring the defendants were without any right thereto, and awarding costs.\n The defendants demurred upon the grounds that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and that the court was without jurisdiction of the subject-matter. The demurrer was sustained, and, the plaintiff electing to stand upon his complaint, a judgment of dismissal was entered. An appeal resulted in an affirmance by the supreme court of the state, which held, first, that the land was not subject to settlement under the homestead law, because the surveyor had designated and meandered it as a lake; and, second, that \n\n[232 U.S. 452, 458]\n\u00a0\n only the Land Department could undo and correct the wrong or error of the surveyor in that regard. 62 Wash. 572, 114 Pac. 501. To secure a reversal of the judgment the plaintiff prosecutes this writ of error.\n Although challenged by the defendants, our jurisdiction does not admit of any doubt. The plaintiff asserted a right to settle upon the land notwithstanding the wrongful act or error of the surveyor in designating and meandering it as a lake, and also a right to remain in possession to the end that he might perform the acts essential to the acquisition of the title; and he expressly predicated these rights upon the homestead law of the United States. The decision was against the rights so claimed, and this brings the case within  709 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575) now  237 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 227].\n The state courts seem to have proceeded upon the theory (a) that the surveyor's action in designating and meandering the 1,200-acre area as a lake operated as an authoritative determination that it was not agricultural land, but a permanent body of water; and (b) that this determination, while remaining undisturbed by the Land Department, took the land without the operation of the settlement laws, including the homestead law. But in this there was a misconception of the authority of the surveyor. He was not invested with power to determine the character of the land which he surveyed or left unsurveyed, or to classify it as within or without the operation of particular laws. All that he was to do in that regard was to note and report its character, as it appeared to him, as a means of enlarging the sources of information upon that subject otherwise available. In Barden v. Northern P. R. Co. \n154 \nU.S. 288, 292\n, 320 S., 38 L. ed. 992, 993, 999, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1030, in disposing of a contention that the lands there in question had been determined and reported by the surveyor as agricultural, and not mineral, and that the determination and report remained in force, this court said: 'But \n\n[232 U.S. 452, 459]\n\u00a0\n the conclusive answer to such alleged determination and report is that the matters to which they relate were not left to the Surveyor General. Neither he nor any of his subordinates was authorized to determine finally the character of any lands granted, or make any binding report thereon. Information of the character of all lands surveyed is required of surveying officers, so far as knowledge respecting them is obtained in the course of their duties, but they are not clothed with authority to especially examine as to these matters outside of their other duties, or determine them, nor does their report have any binding force. It is simply an addition made to the general information obtained from different sources on the subject.' So, if the area designated and meandered as a lake was in truth agricultural land susceptible of cultivation, as alleged in the complaint and admitted by the demurrer, it was as much public land after the survey, and as much within the operation of the settlement laws, as if its true character had been reported by the surveyor. It merely was left unsurveyed. See Niles v. Cedar Point Club, \n175 \nU.S. 300, 308\n, 44 S. L. ed. 171, 174, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 124; French-Glenn Live Stock Co. v. Springer, \n185 U.S. 47\n, 46 L. ed. 800, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 563; Security Land & Exploration Co. v. Burns, \n193 \nU.S. 167, 187\n, 48 S. L. ed. 662, 674, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 425; Scott v.

Rep. 242.\n It will be perceived that we are not speaking of land which was covered by a permanent body of water at the time of the survey, and thereafter was laid bare by a subsidence of the water, nor yet of comparatively small areas which sometimes lie within meander lines reasonably approximating the shores of permanent bodies of water. See Horne v. Smith, \n159 U.S. 40\n, 40 L. ed. 68, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 988; Kean v. Calumet Canal & Improv. Co. \n190 U.S. 452\n, 47 L. ed. 1134, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 651; Hardin v. Shedd, \n190 U.S. 508\n, 47 L. ed. 1156, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 685. Neither are we concerned with a collateral attack upon a public survey, as was the case in Cragin v. Powell, \n128 U.S. 691\n, 33 L. ed. 566, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 203, and Stoneroad v. Stoneroad, \n158 U.S. 240\n, 39 L. ed. 966, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 822, for the plaintiff is not asking that any of the lines of the survey be rejected or altered, but only that a possessory right ac- \n\n[232 U.S. 452, 460]\n\u00a0\n quired by settlement upon public land confessedly left unsurveyed be protected.\n The homestead law in terms subjects unsurveyed public lands, if agricultural and unappropriated, to settlement by persons having the requisite qualifications and intending to comply with its requirements as a means of acquiring the title, and also plainly confers upon the settler the right of possession, without which compliance with those requirements would be impossible.

L. ed. 551, 555, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 380. So, it clearly appears from the allegations of the complaint, as admitted by the demurrer, that the land in question was open to homestead settlement when the plaintiff settled thereon; that by his settlement and subsequent acts he acquired an inceptive homestead right which entitled him to the possession; and that the defendants, in forcing him to withdraw from the land, and in then withholding the same from him, wrongfully invaded this possessory right.\n The question of the jurisdiction of the court of first instance, although not difficult of solution, remains to be noticed. It was not held by the appellate court that the jurisdiction of the former under the local laws was not broad enough to enable it to entertain the action and award appropriate relief, but only that this jurisdiction could not be exerted consistently with the laws of Congress; and this upon the theory that the latter invested the Land Department with exclusive authority to deal with the subject.\n It is true that the authority to make surveys of the public lands is confided to the Land Department, and that \n\n[232 U.S. 452, 461]\n\u00a0\n the courts possess no power to revise or disturb its action in that regard; but here the court was not asked to make a survey or to revise or disturb one already made. As has been indicated, the land in question was not surveyed, but left unsurveyed; and the plaintiff, whose possession under a lawful homestead settlement had been invaded and interrupted by mere trespasses, was seeking a return of the possession to the end that he might continue his rightful efforts to earn the title. In short, it was not a survey, but the right of possession under an inceptive homestead claim, that was in question.\n Generally speaking, it also is true that it is not a province of the courts to interfere with the Land Department in the administration of the public-land laws, and that they are to be deemed in process of administration until the proceedings for the acquisition of the title terminate in the issuing of a patent. But no interference with that Department or usurpation of its functions was here sought or involved. It has not been invested with authority to redress or restrain trespasses upon possessory rights, or to restore the possession to lawful claimants when wrongfully dispossessed. Congress has not prescribed the forum and mode in which such wrongs may be restrained and redressed, as doubtless it could, but has pursued the policy of permitting them to be dealt with in the local tribunals according to local modes of procedure. And the exercise of this jurisdiction has been not only sanctioned by the appellate courts in many of the public-land states, but also recognized and approved by this court. Woodsides v.

It was well said by the supreme court of Oklahoma in Sproat v. Durland, 2 Okla. 24, 45, 35 Pac. 682: 'To say that no relief can be granted, or that our courts are powerless to do justice between litigants in this class of cases, pending the settlement of title in the Land Department, would be the announcement of a doctrine abhorrent to a sense of common justice. It would encourage the strong to override the weak; would place a premium upon greed and the use of force, and in many instances lead to bloodshed and crime. Such a state of affairs is to be avoided; and the courts should not hesitate to invoke the powers inherent in them and lend their aid, in every way possible, in aid of justice by preventing encroachments upon the possessory rights of settlers, or by equitably adjusting their differences.'\n We are accordingly of opinion that the laws of Congress interposed no obstacle to the jurisdiction of the court of first instance, and that, instead of dismissing the case, it should have proceeded to an appropriate disposition of the asserted right of possession.

Chap. 152 of the Session Laws of 1909\n\n\n The grounds of the bill are that the act offends the Constitution of the state and of the United States.\n A summary of the requirements of the act is as follows:\n Sec. 1. Every fire insurance company shall file with the superintendent of insurance general basis schedules showing the rates on all risks insurable by such company in the state, and all the conditions which affect the rates or the value of the insurance to the assured.\n Sec. 2. No change shall be made in the schedules except after ten days' notice to the superintendent, which notice shall state the changes proposed and the time when they \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 391]\n\u00a0\n shall go into effect. The superintendent may allow changes upon less notice.\n Sec. 3. When the superintendent shall determine any rate is excessive or unreasonably high, or not adequate to the safety or soundness of the company, he is authorized to direct the company to publish and file a higher or lower rate, which shall be commensurate with the character of the risk; but in every case the rate shall be reasonable.\n Sec. 4. No company shall engage or participate in insurance on property located in the state until the schedules of rates be filed, nor write insurance at a different rate than the rate named in the schedules, or refund or remit in any manner or by any device any portion of the rates; or extend to any insured or other person any privileges, inducements, or concessions except as specified in the schedules.\n Sec. 5. Any company making insurance where no rate has been filed shall, within thirty days after entering into such contract, file with the superintendent a schedule of such property, showing the rate and such information as he may require. The schedule shall conform to the general basis of schedules, and shall constitute the permanent rate of the company.\n Sec. 6. The schedules shall be open to the inspection of the public, and each local agent shall have and exhibit to the public copies thereof relative to all risks upon which he is authorized to write insurance.\n Sec. 7. No company shall, directly or indirectly, by any special rate or by any device, charge or receive from any person a different rate of compensation for insurance than it charges or receives from any other person for like insurance or risks of a like kind and hazard under similar circumstances and conditions in the state. Any company violating this provision shall be deemed guilty of unjust discrimination, which is declared unlawful.\n Sec. 8. The superintendent may, if he finds that any \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 392]\n\u00a0\n company, or any officer, agent, or representative thereof, has violated any of the provisions of the act, revoke the license of such offending company, officer, or agent, but such revocation shall not affect liability for the violation of any other section of the act; and provided that any action, decision, or determination of the superintendent under the provisions of the act shall be subject to review by the courts of the state as provided in the act.\n Sec. 9. The superintendent shall give notice of any order or regulation made by him under the act, and any company, or any person, city, or municipality which shall be interested, shall have the right within thirty days to bring an action against the superintendent in any district court of the state to have the order or regulation vacated. Issues shall be formed and the controversy tried and determined as in other cases of a civil nature, and the court may set aside one or more or any part of any of the regulations or orders which the court shall find to be unreasonable, unjust, excessive, or inadequate to compensate the company writing insurance thereon for the risk assumed by it, without disturbing others. The order of the superintendent shall not be suspended or enjoined, but the court may permit the complaining company to write insurance at the rates which obtained prior to such order upon the condition that the difference in the rates shall be deposited with the superintendent to be paid to the company or to the holders of policies as, on final determination of the suit, the court may deem just and reasonable. During the pendency of the suit no penalties or forfeitures shall attach or accrue on account of the failure of the complainant to comply with the order sought to be vacated or modified until the final determination of the suit. Proceedings in error may be instituted in the supreme court of the state as in other civil cases, and that court shall examine the record, including the evidence, and render such judgment as shall be just and equitable. No action \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 393]\n\u00a0\n shall be brought in the United States courts until the remedies provided by the act shall habe been exhausted. If any company organized under the laws of the state, or authorized to transact business in a state, shall violate the section, the superintendent may cancel the authority of the company to transact business in the state.\n Sec. 10. Infractions of the act are declared to be misdemeanors and punishable by a fine not exceeding $100 for each offense, provided that if the conviction be for an unlawful discrimination, the punishment may be by a fine or by inprisonment in the county jail not exceeding ninety days, or by both fine and imprisonment.\n Sec. 11. No person shall be excused from testifying at the trial of any other person on the ground that the testimony may incriminate him, but he shall not be prosecuted on account of any transaction about which he may testify, except for perjury committed in so testifying; 'provided, that nothing in this act shall affect farmers' mutual insurance companies, organized and doing business under the laws of this state, and insuring only farm property.'\n The bill alleged that it was brought by the German Alliance Insurance Company in behalf of itself and all other companies and corporations conducting a similar business and similarly situated, and that Charles W. Barnes was the duly elected superintendent of fire insurance of the state of Kansas. It alleged the jurisdictional amount, and that the controversy was one arising under the Constitution of the United States and of the state of Kansas. It alleged, further, the following facts, which we state in narrative form, omitting those which relate to the Constitution of the state, no assignment of error being based upon them. The appellant, to which we shall refer as complainant, was incorporated under the laws of New York as a fire insurance company in 1879, and immediately entered upon such business, and it has for long periods of \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 394]\n\u00a0\n time conducted the business of fire insurance in Kansas and other states of the United States.\n The business of fire insurance as conducted by it consists of making indemnity contracts against direct loss or damage by fire for a consideration paid, known as a premium; that the rate or premium is the amount charged for cach $100 of indemnity. The property which is the subject of insurance is ordinarily known and designated as the risk. Complainant issues indemnity contracts or fire insurance policies covering all kinds and descriptions of improvements upon real estate and the contents thereof, and all kinds and descriptions of personal property, and also farm houses, barns, and granaries and their contents. The rate of premium varies with the kind of property covered, its physical characteristics and situation, its exposure, the presence or absence of fire protection, and many other causes.\n The establishment of the basis rate for the premium to be charged is a matter of technical and mathematical deduction from the experience of all fire insurance companies, covering a long period of years, and, territorially, the whole civilized world. To make such deduction it is necessary not only to be in possession of the compiled statistics of fire insurance business, but also to be skilled in the mathematical 'theory of probabilities' and in the 'law of large numbers' so as to be able to apply with technical accuracy such laws and such data, and that no one not specially trained as an insurance statistician is competent to make such deductions.\n A theoretically correct basis rate having thus been arrived at is subject to variation according to the risk, whether in town or country, and, if in the former, according to the class of town or city in which it is situated. The classification of towns and cities depends upon water supply, fire protection, and general physical conditions. In addition to ascertaining the individual risk, if a build- \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 395]\n\u00a0\n ing the size, material of which, and the manner in which it is constructed, the character of the occupancy, and the character of the occupancy and construction of adjacent buildings, also the character of the contents of the buildings, and the manner in which they are stored, and the precautions used to detect and prevent fires, are necessary to be ascertained.\n Complainant and others engaged in the insurance business employ a large number of men skilled as inspectors to report upon individual risks, and it is impossible to fix and adjust a reasonable rate of premium for each and every individual risk without the information so obtained and having the same applied by experts. And such training and information are necessary to determine whether a basic rate or actual rate, as applied to any particular risk, is or is not reasonable, and the respondent is not possessed of the requisite information or special training necessary to qualify for such determination, and any conclusion to which he might come would be a mere guess or arbitrary determination; and the provisions of the act can only be properly administered in any event by the employment by the state of a corps of inspectors and experts specially trained in the business of fixing rates of fire insurance.\n The complainant has complied with all of the laws of the state, and has received the regular license or authorization of the state, to transact the business of fire insurance therein.\n It conducts its business by means of resident agents, or which it has seventy-two directly employed; it has a large and valuable established business to secure which it has expended a large sum of money, and to be compelled to give up its business would result in irreparable damage and injury to it. A large number of the fire insurance policies issued by complainant are written upon farm buildings and their contents, and in writing such business \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 396]\n\u00a0\n it comes into direct competition with various farmers' mutual insurance companies organized and doing business under the laws of the state, and insuring only farm property.\n The business of fire insurance is purely and exclusively a private business, and may be transacted by private persons in their individual capacity, or by unincorporated or incorporated companies; that the amount of indemnity and the premium is a matter of private negotiation and agreement, and the act of the legislature of the state of Kansas attempts to regulate the business in so far as the fixing of the rate of premium is concerned, and in the attempted regulation distinguishes between fire insurance companies and individuals and partnerships, and thereby denies to complainant and other companies the equal protection of the law, contrary to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and is therefore unconstitutional and void.\n Under the laws of Kansas, mutual fire insurance companies may be organized, that such companies having a guaranteed fund of $25,000 may do business on a cash basis and accept premiums in cash, and that such premium measures the total liability of the insured under the policy, either to the company or to its creditors; that by the 11th section of the act under review, it is provided 'that nothing in this act shall affect farmers' mutual insurance companies, organized and doing business under the laws of this state, and insuring only farm property.' The complainant and many other companies insure farm property and come into direct competition with farmers' mutual companies of the character specified, and the act of the legislature in excepting the latter companies deprives complainant of the equal protection of the laws, and is therefore repugnant to the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and is unconstitutional and void. \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 397]\n\u00a0\n The business of fire insurance is private, with which the state has no right to interfere, and the right to fix by private contract the rate of premium is a property right of value; the business is not a monopoly, either legally or actually; it may not be legally conducted by the national government or by the state of Kansas or other states under their respective constitutions, and is not a business included within the functions of government. Neither complament nor others engaged in fire insurance receive or enjoy from the state of Kansas or any government, state or national, any privilege or immunity not in like manner and to like extent received and enjoyed by all other persons, partnerships, and companies, incorporated or unincorporated, respectively, engaged in the conduct of other lines of private business and enterprises. Complainant, therefore, is deprived of one of the incidents of liberty and of its property without due process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n The act distinguishes between fire insurance companies and other insurance companies, individuals and persons, and distinguishes between insurance and other lines of business and thereby offends the equality clause of the Constitution of the United States.\n Complainant, under protest, filed the general basis schedules of its rates as required by the act, which were arrived at by the process hereinbefore set out. On the 19th of August, 1909, respondent made a reduction of 12 per cent from the rates as filed and from the rates filed by other companies, with the proviso that it should not apply to residence property, churches, schoolhouses, farm property, or special hazards. The order was to become effective September 1, 1909. And it was further ordered that on and after that date the exception of churches and dwelling houses should be eliminated. Complainant notified the superintendent by letter that it would, under \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 398]\n\u00a0\n protest, and reserving the rights which it had under the law, comply with the provisions of the order.\n The risks included in the order, and not excepted therefrom, comprise all ordinary mercantile risks in the state, and that the reduction of 12 per cent will result in a rate which is much less than the cost of carrying the risks.\n Respondent is threatening to make further reductions, and it is proposed to revoke the license of any fire insurance company which may violate the provisions of the act, even though the rates fixed by him may be so low as to be confiscatory, and to inflict upon the officers of the company, including complainant, the penalties prescribed for such violation, and such companies and complainant, unless defendant be restrained by injunction, will be obliged to comply with the requirements of the act to their irreparable damage and injury.\n Complainant finally alleges that it is not its purpose to attack the orders of respondent on the ground that they were not made in strict compliance with the provisions of the act, but to have the act in its entirety declared to be unconstitutional and void for the reasons alleged, and to have respondent restrained and orders made by him under the provisions of the act enjoined. And such an injunction is prayed.\n Respondent filed a demurrer stating that he demurred to so much of the bill as charges the act of the state of Kansas to be repugnant to the Constitution of Kansas and the Constitution of the United States. The demurrer was sustained. Subsequently, upon the bill being amended, a general demurrer was filed, which was also sustained by the court, and the bill dismissed. Prior, however, to this action, it having been suggested that the term of office of Charles W. Barnes as superintendent of insurance had expired, and that Ike Lewis had succeeded to that office and to all of its duties and powers, he was made defendant in the place and stead of Charles W. Barnes. \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 399]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas Bates, John G. Johnson, and Seymour Edgerton for appellant.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 389, 401]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John S. Dawson, Attorney General of Kansas, and Messrs. S. N. Hawks, F. S. Jackson, and Charles Blood Smith for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n\n\n[233 U.S. 389, 404]\n\u00a0\n\n After stating the case as above, Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The specific error complained of is the refusal of the district court to hold that the act of the state of Kansas is unconstitutional and void as offending the due process clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. To support this charge of error, \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 405]\n\u00a0\n complainant asserts that the business of fire insurance is a private business, and, therefore, there is no constitutional power in a state to fix the rates and charges for services rendered by it. An exercise of such right, it is contended, is a taking of private property for a public use. The contention is made in various ways, and, excluding possible countervailing contentions, it is urged that the act under review cannot be justified as an exercise of the police power or of the power of the state to admit foreign corporations within its borders upon such terms as it may prescribe, or of any other power possessed by the state; that no state has the power to impose unconstitutional burdens either upon private citizens or private corporations engaged in a private business.\n The basic contention is that the business of insurance is a natural right, receiving no privilege from the state, is voluntarily entered into, cannot be compelled, nor can any of its exercises be compelled; that it concerns personal contracts of indemnity against certain contingencies merely. Whether such contracts shall be made at all, it is contended, is a matter of private negotiation and agreement, and necessarily there must be freedom in fixing their terms. And 'where the right to demand and receive service does not exist in the public, the correlative right of regulation as to rates and charges does not exist.' Many elements, it is urged, determine the extending or rejection of insurance; the hazards are relative and depend upon many circumstances upon which there may be different judgments, and there are personal considerations as well,-'moral hazards,' as they are called.\n It is not clear to what extent some of these circumstances are urged as affecting the power of regulation in the state. It would seem to be urged that each risk is individual, and no rule of rates can be formed or applied. The bill asserts the contrary. It in effect admits that there can be standards and classification of risks, determined by the \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 406]\n\u00a0\n law of averages. Indeed, it is a matter of common knowledge that rates are fixed and accommodated to those standards and classifications in pre- arranged schedules, and, granted the rates may be varied in particular instances, they are sufficiently definite and applicable as a general and practically constant rule. They are the product, it is true, of skill and experience, but such skill and experience a regulating body may have as well as the creating body. Indeed, an allegation in the original bill that the superintendent of insurance could not have the requisite technical and mathematical training to determine whether a basic rate or an actual rate as applied to any particular risk was or was not reasonable, and that his conclusion, therefore, 'would be a mere guess or arbitrary determination,' was omitted by an amendment. It would indeed be a strained contention that the government could not avail itself, in the exercise of power it might deem wise to exert, of the skill and knowledge possessed by the world. We may put aside, therefore, all merely adventitious considerations and come to the bare and essential one, whether a contract of fire insurance is private, and as such has constitutional immunity from regulation. Or, to state it differently and to express an antithetical proposition, is the business of insurance so far affected with a public interest as to justify legislative regulation of its rates? And we mean a broad and definite public interest. In some degree the public interest is concerned in every transaction between men, the sum of the transactions constituting the activities of life. But there is something more special than this, something of more definite consequence, which makes the public interest that justifies regulatory legislation. We can best explain by examples. The transportation of property-business of common carriers-is obviously of public concern, and its regulation is an accepted governmental power. The transmission of intelligence is of cognate character. There are other \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 407]\n\u00a0\n utilities which are denominated public, such as the furnishing of water and light, including in the latter gas and electricity. We do not hesitate at their regulation nor of the fixing of the prices which may be charged for their service. The basis of the ready concession of the power of regulation is the public interest. This is not denied, but its application to insurance is so far denied as not to extend to the fixing of rates. It is said, the state has no power to fix the rates charged to the public by either corporations or individuals engaged in a private business, and the 'test of whether the use is public or not is whether a public trust is imposed upon the property, and whether the public has a legal right to the use which cannot be denied;' or, as we have said, quoting counsel, 'Where the right to demand and receive service does not exist in the public, the correlative right of regulation as to rates and charges does not exist.' Cases are cited which, it must be admitted, support the contention. The distinction is artificial. It is, indeed, but the assertion that the cited examples embrace all cases of public interest. The complainant explicitly so contends, urging that the test it applies excludes the idea that there can be a public interest which gives the power of regulation as distinct from a public use, which, necessarily, it is contended, can only apply to property, not to personal contracts. The distinction, we think, has no basis in principle (Noble State Bank v. Haskell, \n219 U.S. 104\n, 55 L. ed. 112, 32 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1062, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 186, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 487), nor has the other contention that the service which cannot be demanded cannot be regulated.\n Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n, 24 L. ed. 77, is an instructive example of legislative power exerted in the public interest. The Constitution of Illinois declared all elevators or storehouses, where grain or other property was stored for a compensation, to be public warehouses, and a law was subsequently enacted fixing rates of storage. In other words, that which had been private property had from its \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 408]\n\u00a0\n uses become, it was declared, of public concern, and the compensation to be charged for its use prescribed. The law was sustained against the contention that it deprived the owners of the warehouses of their property without due process of law. We can only cite the case and state its principle, not review it at any length. The principle was expressed to be, quoting Lord Chief Justice Hale, 'that when private property is 'affected with a public interest, it ceases to be juris privati' only' and it becomes 'clothed with a public interest when used in a manner to make it of public consequence, and affect the community at large;' and, so using it, the owner 'grants to the public an interest in that use, and must submit to be controlled by the public for the common good.' And it was said that the application of the principle could not be denied because no precedent could be found for a statute precisely like the one reviewed. It presented a case, the court further said, 'for the application of a longknown and well-established principle in social science, and this statute simply extends the law so as to meet this new development of commercial progress.' The principle was expressed as to property, and the instance of its application was to property, but it is manifestly broader than that instance. It is the business that is the fundamental thing; property is but its instrument, the means of rendering the service which has become of public interest.\n That the case had broader application than the use of property is manifest from the grounds expressed in the dissenting opinion. The basis of the opinion was that the business regulated was private and had 'no special privilege connected with it, nor did the law ever extend to it any greater protection than it extended to all other private business.' The argument encountered opposing examples, among others, the regulation of the rate of interest on money. The regulation was accounted for on the ground that the act of Parliament permitting the charging \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 409]\n\u00a0\n of some interest was a relaxation of a prohibition of the common law against charging any interest; but this explanation overlooked the fact that both the common law and the act of Parliament were exercises of government regulation of a strictly private business in the interest of public policy,-a policy which still endures and still dictates regulating laws. Against that conservatism of the mind which puts to question every new act of regulating legislation, and regards the legislation invalid or dangerous until it has become familiar, government-state and national-has pressed on in the general welfare; and our reports are full of cases where in instance after instance the exercise of regulation was resisted and yet sustained against attacks asserted to be justified by the Constitution of the United States. The dread of the moment having passed, no one is now heard to say that rights were restrained or their constitutional guaranties impaired.\n Munn v. Illinois was approved in many state decisions, but it was brought to the review of this court in Budd v. New York, \n143 U.S. 517\n, 36 L. ed. 247, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 45, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 468, and its doctrine, after elaborate consideration, reaffirmed, and against the same arguments which are now urged against the Kansas statute. Nowhere have these arguments been, or could be, advanced with greater strength and felicity of expression than in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Brewer. Every consideration was adduced, based on the private character of the business regulated, and, for that reason, its constitutional immunity from regulation, with all the power of argument and illustration of which that great judge was a master. The considerations urged did not prevail. Against them the court opposed the everexisting police power in government and its necessary exercise for the public good, and declared its entire accommodation to the limitations of the Constitution. The court was not deterred by the charge (repeated in the case at bar) that its decision had the sweeping and dangerous comprehension of subjecting to \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 410]\n\u00a0\n legislative regulation all of the businesses and affairs of life and the prices of all commodities. Whether we may apprehend such result by extending the principle of the cases to fire insurance we shall presently consider.\n In Brass v. North Dakota, \n153 U.S. 391\n, 38 L. ed. 757, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 670, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 857; Munn v. Illinois and Budd v. New York were affirmed. A law of the state of North Dakota was sustained which made all buildings, elevators, and warehouses used for the handling of grain for a profit public warehouses, and fixed a storage rate. The case is important. It extended the principle of the other two cases and denuded it of the limiting element which was supposed to beset it,-that to justify regulation of a business the business must have a monopolistic character. That distinction was pressed and answered. It was argued, the court said. 'That the statutes of Illinois and New York [passed on in the Munn and Budd Cases] are intended to operate in great trade centers, where, on account of the business being localized in the hands of a few persons in close proximity to each other, great opportunities for combinations to raise and control elevating and storage charges are afforded, while the wide extent of the state of North Dakota and the small population of its country towns and villages are said to present no such opportunities.' And it was also urged that the method of carrying on business in North Dakota and the Eastern cities was different, that the elevators in the latter were essentially means of transporting grain from the lakes to the railroads, and those who owned them could, if uncontrolled by law, extort such charges as they pleased, and stress was laid upon the expression in the other cases which represented the business as a practical monopoly. A contrast was made between those conditions and those which existed in an agricultural state where land was cheap and limitless in quantity. It was replied that this difference in conditions was 'for those who make, not for those who interpret, the laws.' And con- \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 411]\n\u00a0\n sidering the expressions in the other cases which, it was said, went rather to the expediency of the laws than to their validity, yet, it was further said, the expressions had their value because the 'obvious aim of the reasoning that prevailed was to show that the subject-matter of these enactments fell within the legitimate sphere of legislative power, and that so far as the laws and Constitution of the United States were concerned, the legislation in question deprived no person of his property without due process of law.'\n The cases need no explanatory or fortifying comment. They demonstrate that a business, by circumstances and its nature, may rise from private to be of public concern, and be subject, in consequence, to governmental regulation. And they demonstrate, to apply the language of Judge Andrews in the Budd Case (117 N. Y. 27, 5 L.R.A. 559, 15 Am. St. Rep. 460, 22 N. E. 670), that the attempts made to place the right of public regulation in the cases in which it has been exerted, and of which we have given examples, upon the ground of special privilege conferred by the public on those affected, cannot be supported. 'The underlying principle is that business of certain kinds hold such a peculiar relation to the public interest that there is superinduced upon it the right of public regulation.' Is the business of insurance within the principle? It would be a bold thing to say that the principle is fixed, inelastic, in the precedents of the past, and cannot be applied though modern economic conditions may make necessary or beneficial its application. In other words, to say that government possessed at one time a greater power to recognize the public interest in a business and its regulation to promote the general welfare than government possesses to-day. We proceed, then, to consider whether the business of insurance is within the principle.\n A contract for fire insurance is one for indemnity against loss, and is personal. The admission, however, does not \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 412]\n\u00a0\n take us far in the solution of the question presented. Its personal character certainly does not of itself preclude regulation, for there are many examples of government regulation of personal contracts, and in the statutes of every state in the Union superintendence and control over the business of insurance are exercised, varying in details and extent. We need not particularize in detail. We need only say that there was quite early (in Massachusetts, 1837, New York, 1853) state provision for what is known as the unearned premium fund or reserve; then came the limitation of dividends, the publishing of accounts, valued policies, standards of policies, prescribing investment, requiring deposits in money or bonds, confining the business to corporations, preventing discrimination in rates, limitation of risks, and other regulations equally restrictive. In other words, the state has stepped in and imposed conditions upon the companies, restraining the absolute liberty which businesses strictly private are permitted to exercise.\n Those regulations exhibit it to be the conception of the lawmaking bodies of the country without exception that the business of insurance so far affects the public welfare as to invoke and require governmental regulation. A conception so general cannot be without cause. The universal sense of a people cannot be accidental; its persistence saves it from the charge of unconsidered impulse, and its estimate of insurance certainly has substantial basis. Accidental fires are inevitable and the extent of loss very great. The effect of insurance-indeed, it has been said to be its fundamental object-is to distribute the loss over as wide an area as possible. In other words, the loss is spread over the country, the disaster to an individual is shared by many, the disaster to a community shared by other communities; great catastrophes are thereby lessened, and, it may be, repaired. In assimilation of insurance to a tax, the companies have been said to be \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 413]\n\u00a0\n the mere machinery by which the inevitable losses by fire are distributed so as to fall as lightly as possible on the public at large, the body of the insured, not the companies, paying the tax. Their efficiency, therefore, and solvency, are of great concern. The other objects, direct and indirect, of insurance, we need not mention. Indeed, it may be enough to say, without stating other effects of insurance, that a large part of the country's wealth, subject to uncertainty of loss through fire, is protected by insurance. This demonstrates the interest of the public in it, and we need not dispute with the economists that this is the result of the 'substitution of certain for uncertain loss,' or the diffusion of positive loss over a large group of persons, as we have already said to be certainly one of its effects. We can see, therefore, how it has come to be considered a matter of public concern to regulate it, and, governmental insurance has its advocates and even examples. Contracts of insurance, therefore, have greater public consequence than contracts between individuals to do or not to do a particular thing whose effect stops with the individuals. We may say in passing that when the effect goes beyond that, there are many examples of regulation. Holden v. Hardy, \n169 U.S. 366\n, 42 L. ed. 780, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 383; Griffith v. Connecticut, \n218 U.S. 563\n, 54 L. ed. 1151, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132; Muller v. Oregon, \n208 U.S. 412\n, 52 L. ed. 551, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 324, 13 Ann. Cas. 957; Mutual Loan Co. v. Martell, \n222 U.S. 225\n, 56 L. ed. 175, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 74, Ann. Cas. 1913B, 529; Schmidinger v. Chicago, \n226 U.S. 578\n, 57 L. ed. 364, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 182; Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 U.S. 549\n, 55 L. ed. 328, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 259; Noble State Bank v. Haskell, \n219 U.S. 104\n, 55 L. ed. 112, 32 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1062, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 186, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 487.\n Complainant feels the necessity of accounting for the regulatory state legislation and refers it to the exertion of the police power; but, while expressing the power in the broad language of the cases, seeks to restrict its application. Counsel states that this power may be exerted to 'pass laws whose purpose is the health, safety, morals, and the general welfare of the people.' The admission is very comprehensive. What makes for the general welfare is \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 414]\n\u00a0\n necessarily in the first instance a matter of legislative judgment, and a judicial review of such judgment is limited. 'The scope of judicial inquiry in deciding the question of power is not to be confused with the scope of legislative considerations in dealing with the matter of policy. Whether the enactment is wise or unwise, whether it is based on sound economic theory, whether it is the best means to achieve the desired result, whether, in short, the legislative discretion within its prescribed limits should be exercised in a particular manner, are matters for the judgment of the legislature, and the earnest conflict of serious opinion does not suffice to bring them within the range of judicial cognizance.' Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 \nU.S. 540, 569\n, 55 S. L. ed, 328, 339, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 259.\n The restrictions upon the legislative power which complainant urges we have discussed, or rather, the considerations which take, it is contended, the business of insurance outside of the sphere of the power. To the contention that the business is private we have opposed the conception of the public interest. We have shown that the business of insurance has very difinite characteristics, with a reach of influence and consequence beyond and different from that of the ordinary businesses of the commercial world, to pursue which a greater liberty may be asserted. The transactions of the latter are independent and individual, terminating in their effect with the instances. The contracts of insurance may be said to be interdependent. They cannot be regarded singly, or isolatedly, and the effect of their relation is to create a fund of assurance and credit, the companies becoming the depositories of the money of the insured, possessing great power thereby, and charged with great responsibility. How necessary their solvency is, is manifest. On the other hand, to the insured, insurance is an asset, a basis of credit. It is practically a necessity to business activity and enterprise. It is, therefore, essentially different from ordinary com- \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 415]\n\u00a0\n mercial transactions, and, as we have seen, according to the sense of the world from the earliest times,-certainly the sense of the modern world,-is of the greatest public concern. It is therefore within the principle we have announced.\n But it is said that the reasoning of the opinion has the broad reach of subjecting to regulation every act of human endeavor and the price of every article of human use. We might, without much concern, leave our discussion to take care of itself against such misunderstanding or deductions. The principle we apply is definite and old, and has, as we have pointed out, illustrating examples. And both by the expression of the principle and the citation of the examples we have tried to confine our decision to the regulation of the business of insurance, it having, become 'clothed with a public interest,' and therefore subject 'to be controlled by the public for the common good.'\n If there may be controversy as to the business having such character, there can be no controversy as to what follows from such character if it be established. It is idle, therefore, to debate whether the liberty of contract guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States is more intimately involved in price regulation than in the other forms of regulation as to the validity of which there is no dispute. The order of their enactment certainly cannot be considered an element in their legality. It would be very rudimentary to say that measures of government are determined by circumstances, by the presence or imminence of conditions, and of the legislative judgment of the means or the policy of removing or preventing them. The power to regulate interstate commerce existed for a century before the interstate commerce act was passed, and the Commission constituted by it was not given authority to fix rates until some years afterwards. Of the agencies which those measures were enacted to \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 416]\n\u00a0\n regulate at the time of the creation of the power, there was no prophecy or conception. Nor was regulation immediate upon their existence. It was exerted only when the size, number, and influence of those agencies had so increased and developed as to seem to make it imperative. Other illustrations readily occur which repel the intimation that the inactivity of a power, however prolonged, militates against its legality when it is exercised. United States ex rel. Atty. Gen. v. Delaware & H. Co. \n213 U.S. 366\n, 53 L. ed. 836, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 527. It is oftener the existence of necessity rather than the prescience of it which dictates legislation. And so with the regulations of the business of insurance. They have proceeded step by step, differing in different jurisdictions. If we are brought to a comparison of them in relation to the power of government, how can it be said that fixing the price of insurance is beyond that power and the other instances of regulation are not? How can it be said that the right to engage in the business is a natural one when it can be denied to individuals and permitted to corporations? How can it be said to have privilege of a private business when its dividends are restricted, its investments controlled, the form and extent of its contracts prescribed, discriminations in its rates denied, and a limitation on its risks imposed? Are not such regulations restraints upon the exercise of the personal right-asserted to be fundamental-of dealing with property freely, or engaging in what contracts one may choose, and with whom and upon what terms one may choose?\n We may venture to observe that the price of insurance is not fixed over the counters of the companies by what Adam Smith calls the higgling of the market, but formed in the councils of the underwriters, promulgated in schedules of practically controlling constancy which the applicant for insurance is powerless to oppose, and which, therefore, has led to the assertion that the business of insurance is of monopolistic character and that 'it is illusory \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 417]\n\u00a0\n to speak of a liberty of contract.' It is in the alternative presented of accepting the rates of the companies or refraining from insurance, business necessity impelling if not compelling it, that we may discover the inducement of the Kansas statute; and the problem presented is whether the legislature could regard it of as much moment to the public that they who seek insurance should no more be constrained by arbitrary terms than they who seek transportation by railroads, steam, or street, or by coaches whose itinerary may be only a few city blocks, or who seek the use of grain elevators, or to be secured in a night's accommodation at a wayside inn, or in the weight of a 5 cent loaf of bread. We do not say this to belittle such rights or to exaggerate the effect of insurance, but to exhibit the principle which exists in all and brings all under the same governmental power.\n We have summarized the provisions of the Kansas statute, and it will be observed from them that they attempt to systematize the control of insurance. The statute seeks to secure rates which shall be reasonable both to the insurer and the insured, and as a means to this end it prescribes equality of charges, forbids initial discrimination or subsequently by the refund of a portion of the rates, or the extension to the insured of any privilege; to this end it requires publicity in the basic schedules and of all of the conditions which affect the rates or the value of the insurance to the insured, and also adherence to the rates as published. Whether the requirements are necessary to the purpose, or-to confine ourselves to that which in under review-whether rate regulation is necessary to the purpose, is a matter for legislative judgment, not judicial. Our function is only to determine the existence of power.\n The bill attacks the statute of Kansas as discriminating against complainant because the statute excludes from its provisions farmers' mutual insurance companies, organized \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 418]\n\u00a0\n and doing business under the laws of the state and insuring only farm property. The charge is not discussed in the elaborate brief of counsel, nor does it seem to have been pressed in the lower court, it is, however, covered by the assignments of error.\n The provision of the statute is, 'That nothing in this act shall affect farmers' mutual insurance companies, organized and doing business under the laws of this state, and insuring only farm property.' The distinction is therefore between co-operative insurance companies insuring a special kind of property and all other insurance companies. It is only with that distinction that we are now concerned. There are special provisions in the statutes of Kansas for the organization of co-operative companies, and if the statute under review discriminates between them the German Aliance Company cannot avail itself of the discrimination. A citation of cases is not necessary, nor for the general principle that a discrimination is valid if not arbitrary, and arbitrary in the legislative sense, that is, outside of that wide discretion which a legislature may exercise. A legislative classification may rest on narrow distinctions. Legislation is addressed to evils as they may appear, and even degrees of evil may determine its exercise. Ozan Lumber Co. v. Union County Nat. Bank, \n202 U.S. 623\n, 50 L. ed. 1176, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 768. There are certainly differences between stock companies, such as complainant is, and the mutual companies described in the bill, and a recognition of the differences we cannot say is outside of the constitutional power of the legislature. Orient Ins. Co. v. Daggs, \n172 U.S. 557\n, 43 L. ed. 552, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 281.\n Decree affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar, dissenting:\n I dissent from the decision and the reasoning upon which it is based. The case does not deal with a statute affect- \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 419]\n\u00a0\n ing the safety or morals of the public. It presents no question of monopoly in a prime necessity of life, but relates solely to the power of the state to fix the price of a strictly personal contract. The court holds that fire insurance, though personal, is affected with a public interest, and therefore that the business may not only be regulated, but that the premium or price to be paid to the insurer for entering into that personal contract can be fixed by law.\n The fixing of the price for the use of private property is as much a taking as though the fee itself had been condemned for a lump sum; that taking, whether by fixing rates for the use or by paying a lump sum for the fee, has always heretofore been thought to be permissible only when it was for a public use. But the court in this case holds that there is no distinction between the power to take for public use and the power to regulate the exercise of private rights for the public good. That is the fundamental proposition on which the case must stand, and the decision must therefore be considered in the light of that ruling and of the results which must necessarily flow from the future application of that principle. For if the power to regulate, in the interest of the public, comprehends what is intended in the power to take property for public use, it must inevitably follow that the price to be paid for any service or the use of any property can be regulated by the general assembly. This is so because the power of regulation is all-pervading, as witness the statute of frauds, the recording acts, weight and measure laws, pure food laws, hours of service laws, and innumerable other enactments of that class. And if this power be as extensive as is now, for the first time, decided, then the citizen holds his property and his individual right of contract and of labor under legislative favor rather than under constitutional guaranty. The principle is applied here to the case of insurance; but the nature of that business \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 420]\n\u00a0\n and the intangible character of its contracts are such as to indicate the farreaching effect of the principle announced, and warrants a statement of some of the grounds of dissent.\n Insurance is not production; nor manufacture; nor transportation; nor merchandise. And this court in New York L. Ins. Co. v. Deer Lodge Co. at the present term [\n231 U.S. 495\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 167] reaffirmed its previous rulings that 'insurance is not commerce,' 'not an instrumentality of commerce,' 'not a transaction of commerce,' 'but simply contracts of indemnity against loss by fire.' Such a contract is personal, and in the state whose statute is under consideration, insurance companies are classed among those 'strictly private.' Leavenworth County v. Miller, 7 Kan. 520, 12 Am. Rep. 425. The fact that insurance is a strictly private and a personal contract of indemnity puts it on the extreme outside limit, and removes it as far as any business can be from those that are in their nature public. So that if the price of a private and personal contract of indemnity can be regulated,-if the price of a chose in action can be fixed,- then the price of everything within the circle of business transactions can be regulated. Considering, therefore, the nature of the subject treated and the reasoning on which the court's opinion is based, it is evident that the decision is not a mere entering wedge, but reaches the end from the beginning, and announces a principle which points inevitably to the conclusion that the price of every article sold and the price of every service offered can be regulated by statute.\n And such laws are not without English precedent. For while no statute ever before attempted to fix the price of a contract of indemnity, yet under a Parliament that sat as a perpetual constitutional convention, with power\n The statute fixing the premium rates on surety bonds was held to be void in American Surety Co. v. Shallenberger, 183 Fed. 636. \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 421]\n\u00a0\n to pass bills of attainder to take property for private purposes, and to take it without due process of law, many statutes approaching that now under review were adopted and enforced. Acts were passed by Parliament fixing the price of many commodities that were convenient or useful. These laws did not stop at fixing the price of property, but, like the present act, they fixed the price of private contracts, and by statute prescribed the rate of wages, and made it unlawful for the employee to receive or for the employer to give more than the wage fixed by law. It is needless to say that these laws were felt to be an infringement upon the rights of men; that they were bitterly resisted by buyer and seller, by employer and employee, and were a source of perpetual irritation often leading to violence. But the fact that the English Parliament had the arbitrary power to pass such statutes made them valid in law, though they were in violation of the inherent rights of individual. In time, the great injustice in this was so far recognized that these laws, fixing the price of strictly private contracts, seem to have been repealed, and Lord Ellenborough, while enforcing, as proper, a rate for public wharves, was able to say, in Allnutt v. Inglis, 12 East, 535, 'that the general principle is favored that every man may fix whatever price he pleases for his own property or for the use of it.' But what was a favor in England, that might at any time be withdrawn, was in this country made a constitutional right that could not be withdrawn. For although the practice of fixing prices may have prevailed in some of the colonies 'up to the time of independence,' yet, as Judge Cooley says, since independence 'it has been commonly supposed that a general power in the state to regulate prices was inconsistent with constitutional liberty.' Cooley, Const. Lim. 7th ed. 807; Stickney, State Control of Trade, p. 3, and the abstract of English price-fixing statutes, pp. 9 et seq. That common supposition is rightly founded on the fact \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 422]\n\u00a0\n that the Constitution recognizes the liberty to contract and right of private property. They include not only the right to make contracts with which to acquire property, but the right to fix the price of its use while it is held, and the further right to fix the price if it is to be sold. To deprive any person of either is to take property, since there can be no liberty of contract and true private ownership if the price of its use or its sale is fixed by law. That right is an attribute of ownership. State Freight Tax Case, 15 Wall. 278, top, 21 L. ed. 162.\n But it may be said that, though insurance is a contract of indemnity, and personal, its personal character has not been thought to preclude the many regulatory measures adopted and sustained during the past hundred years.\n This is most freely conceded. But it is equally true that the failure for more than one hundred years to attempt to fix the rates of insurance is indubitable evidence of the general public and legislative conception that the business of insurance did not belong to the class whose rates could be fixed. That settled usage is not an accident. For rate-making is no new thing, and neither is insurance. Its use in protecting the owner of property against loss; its value as collateral in securing loans; its method of averages and distributing the risk between many persons widely separated, and all contributing small premiums in return for the promise of a large indemnity, has been known for centuries. All these considerations were recently pressed upon the court in an effort to secure a ruling that insurance was commerce. In refusing to accede to the sufficiency of the argument, the court, in the Deer Lodge Case, pointed out that the size of the business of insurance did not change the inherent nature of the business itself, saying that 'the number of transactions do not give the business any other character than magnitude.'\n The character of insurance, therefore, as a private and personal contract of indemnity, has, not been changed by \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 423]\n\u00a0\n its magnitude or by the fact that more policies and for greater amounts are now written than in the centuries during which no effort has ever before been made to fix their rates. It is, however, undoubtedly true that during all of that period regulatory statutes were, from time to time, adopted to protect the public against conditions and practices which were subject to regulation. The public had no means of knowing whether these corporations were solvent or not, and statutes were passed to require a publication of the financial condition. The policies were long and complicated, with exceptions and qualifications and provisos. They were often unread by the policy holder and sometimes not understood when read. Statutes were accordingly passed providing for a standard form of policy in order to protect the assured against his inexperience, to prevent hard bargains, and to avoid vexatious litigation; and as similar evils appear they may be dealt with by regulatory or prohibitory legislation just as statutes were passed, and can still be passed to punish combinations, pooling arrangements, and all those practices which amount to unfair competition.\n But these and those referred to in McCarter v. Firemen's Ins. Co. 74 N. J. Eq. 372, 29 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1194, 135 Am. St. Rep. 708, 73 Atl. 80, 414, 18 Ann. Cas. 1048, furnish instances of the exercise of this power to regulate which can be exerted against any person, trade, or business, no matter great or small. This power to regulate is so much oftener exerted against the large business, because the evils are then more apparent, that the size of the business and the number of persons interested is sometimes referred to as indicating that the business is affected with a public interest. But there is no such limitation. For the power to regulate is the essential power of government which can be exerted against the whole body of the public or the smallest business. And if, as seems to be implied, the fact that a business may be regulated is to be the test of the power to fix rates, it would follow, since all can be \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 424]\n\u00a0\n regulated, the price charged by all can be regulated. Or if great size is the test, if the number of customers is the test, if the scope of the business throughout the nation is the test, if the contributions of the many to the value of the business is the test,-or if it takes a combination of all to meet the condition,-then every business with great capital and many customers distributed throughout the country, and making a large business possible, must be treated as affected with a public interest, and the price of the goods on its shelves can be fixed by law. Then could the price of newspapers, magazines, and the like be fixed, because certainly nothing is more affected with a public interest, nothing is so dependent on the public, nothing reaches so many persons, and so profoundly affects public thought and public business. Such a business is, indeed, affected with a public interest,-justifying regulation (Lewis Pub. Co. v. Morgan, \n229 U.S. 288\n, 57 L. ed. 1190, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 867), but not the fixing of the price of the paper or periodical or the rates of advertising. For great and pervasive as is the power to regulate, it cannot override the constitutional principle that private property cannot be taken for private purposes. Missouri P. R. Co. v. Nebraska, \n164 U.S. 403\n, 41 L. ed. 489, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 130. That limitation on the power of government over the individual and his property cannot be avoided by calling an unlawful taking a reasonable regulation. Indeed, the protection of property is an incident of the more fundamental and important right of liberty guaranteed by the Constitution, and which entitled the citizen freely to engage in any honest calling, and to make contracts as buyer or seller, as employer or employee, in order to support himself and family.\n It said, however, that the validity of rates statutes has often been recognized, notably in the Munn Case (\n94 U.S. 126\n, 24 L. ed. 84), where a statute was sustained which regulated the price to be charged for storing grain in elevators.\n The Munn Case is a landmark in the law. It is accepted \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 425]\n\u00a0\n as an authoritative and accurate statement of the principle on which the right to fix rates is based. But the statute there under review did not undertake to fix the price of a personal contract, but to fix the price for the use of property, once private, but then public. The reasoning of the court clearly shows that in order to regulate rates, two things must concur-(1) the business must be affected with a public interest; and (2) the property employed in such business must be devoted to a public use. The basic principle of the decision was the oft-quoted saying of Lord Hale that 'when private property is 'affected with a public interest, it ceases to be juris privati only.\" The decison in the Munn Case was but an application of that terse statement, and was applied in a case where the elevators had been devoted to a public use. This will distinctly appear from the statement by the court of the question involved and decided. For after reviewing and applying Lord Hale's pithy saying, and reviewing the other authorities, the court said (italics ours):\n'Enough has already been said to show that when private property is devoted to a public use it is subject to public regulation. It remains only to ascertain whether the warehouses of these plaintiffs in error and the business which is carried on there come within the operation of this principle.'\n\n Not only does the Munn Case show that the right to fix prices depends on the concurrence of public interest and the employment of property devoted to a public use, but, with the exception of the Louisiana Bread Case, Guillotte v. New Orleans, 12 La. Ann. 432, it is believed that every American rate statute since the requirement that property should not be taken without due process of law related to a business which was public in its character and employed visible and tangible property which had been devoted to a public use.\n The list of rate-regulated occupations is not too long to be here given. It includes canals, waterways, and \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 426]\n\u00a0\n booms; bridges and ferries; wharves, docks, elevators, and stockyards; telegraph, telephone, electric, gas, and oil lines; turnpikes, railroads, and the various forms of common carriers, including express and cabs. To this should be added the case of the innkeeper (as to which no American case has been found where the constitutional question as to the right to fix his rates has been considered), the confessedly close case of the irrigation ditches for distributing water (\n193 U.S. 379\n), and the toll mill acts. This, of course, does not include the case of condemnation for governmental purposes or for roads and ways where no question of rates is involved. There may be other instances not found, but it is believed that the foregoing numeration exhausts the list of what has heretofore been treated as a public business justifying the exercise of the price-fixing power against persons or corporations.\n It is to be noted that in each instance the power to regulate rates is exercised against a business which in every case used tangible property devoted to a public use. Some of them had a monopoly (Spring Valley Waterworks v. Schottler, \n110 U.S. 354\n, 28 L. ed. 176, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 48). Some of them had franchises. Most of them used public ways or employed property which they had acquired by virtue of the power of eminent domain. They were therefore subject, to the correlative obligation to have the use, of what had been thus taken by law, fixed by law. And as further pointing out the characteristics of the public use justifying the fixing of prices, it will be noted that, with the exception of toll mills (which, however, to employ property devoted to a public use), they all have direct relation to the business or facilities of transportation or distribution,-to transportation by carriers of passengers, goods, or intelligence by vehicle or wire; to distribution of water, gas, or electricity through ditch, pipe, or wire; to wharfage, storage, or accommodation of property before the journey begins, when it ends, or along the way. \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 427]\n\u00a0\n When thus enumerated, they appear to be grouped around the common carrier as the typical public business, and all employing in some way property devoted to a public use.\n It will be seen, too, that the size of the business in unimportant, for the fares of a cabman, employing a broken-down horse and a dilapidated vehicle, can be fixed by law as well as the rates of a railroad with millions of capital and thousands of cars transporting persons and property across the continent.\n The fact that rate statutes, enacted and sustained since the adoption of constitutional government in this country, all had some reference to transportation or distribution, is a practical illustration of the accepted meaning of 'public use' when that phrase was first employed in American Constitutions, and when turnpikes and carriers, wharfingers and ferrymen, had rates, tolls, and fares fixed by law. No change was made in the meaning of the words or in the principle involved when it opened to take in new forms and facilities of transportation, whether by vehicle, pipe, or wire, and new forms of storage, whether on the wharf or in the grain elevator.\n But it is said that business is the fundamental thing, with the property but an instrument, and that there is no basis for the distinction between a public interest and a public use. But there is a distinction between a public interest-justifying regulation-and a public use- justifying price fixing. 'Public interest and public use are not synonymous.' Re Niagara Falls & W. R. Co. 108 N. Y. 385, 15 N. E. 429. And since the case here involves the validity of a Kansas statute, it is well to note that the supreme court of that state in Howard Mills Co. v. Schwartz Lumber & Coal Co. 77 Kan. 599, 18 L.R.A.(N.S.) 356, 95 Pac. 559, recognizes that there is a difference, and adjudges accordingly. It there cited numerous decisions from other states, and in defining a public use made the following quotation from the opinion of the supreme court of Maine: \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 428]\n\u00a0\n \"Property is devoted to a public use when, and only when, . . . all the public has a right to demand and share in' [it] . . . In a broad sense it is the right in the public to an actual use, and not to an incidental benefit.'\n The effect of the difference between public use and public interest appears from the application; for the supreme court of Kansas, on the authority of this and numerous other cases, held that a steam flour mill was not such a public use as would authorize its owners to exercise the power of eminent domain, though it was a useful and important business instrumentality which contributed to the growth and development of the locality where the [mills] are situated. This may also be said, however, of every legitimate business. To a limited extent every honest industry adds to the general sum of prosperity and promotes the public welfare.\n Nothing more can be said of insurance-nor can the power to take the private property of insurers by fixing rates be enlarged by a legislative declaration that the business is affected with a broad and definite public interest. For since the contract of insurance is private and personal, it is almost a contradiction in terms to say that the private contract is public, or that a business which consists in making such private contracts is public in the constitutional sense. The fundamental idea of a public business, as well declared by the supreme court of Kansas (77 Kan. 608), is that 'all of the public have a right to demand and share in it.' That means that each member of the public, on demand and upon equal terms, without written contract, without haggling as to terms, may demand the public service, and secure the use of the facility devoted to public use. If the company can make distinctions and serve one and refuse to serve another, the business ex vi termini is not public. The common carrier has no right to refuse to haul a passenger even if he has been \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 429]\n\u00a0\n convicted of arson. But if an insurance company is indeed public, it is bound to insure the property of the man who is suspected of having set fire to his own house, or whose statements of value it is unwilling to take. This is manifestly inconsistent with the contract of insurance, which requires the utmost good faith, not only in making truthful answers to questions asked, but in nor concealing anything material to the risk. If the company has the discretion to insure or the right to refuse to insure, then, by the very definition of the terms, it is not a public business. If, on the other hand, the company is obliged to insure bad risks or the property of men of bad character, of doubtful veracity, or known to be careless in their handling of property, the law would be an arbitrary exertion of power in compelling men to enter into contract with persons with whom they did not choose to deal where confidence is the very foundation of a contract of indemnity. Indeed, it seems to be conceded that a person owning property is not entitled to demand insurance as a matter of right. If not, the business is not public, and not within the provision of the Constitution which only authorizes the taking of property for public purposes-whether the taking be of the fee, for a lump sum assessed in condemnation proceedings, or whether the use be taken by rate regulation, which is but another method of exercising the same power.\n The suggestion that the public interest is found in the characteristics of the business of insurance justifies a brief examination of those characteristics and a statement of the results that logically must follow from such a test. For if the power is to develop out of the characteristies, it must necessarily follow that other occupations, having similar characteristics, must be subject to the same rate regulating power.\n The elements which are said to show that insurance is affected with a public interest do not arise out of the size of any one company, but out of the volume of the aggre- \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 430]\n\u00a0\n gate business of all the companies doing business within the state and beyond its borders. If that test be applied, and if the sum of the units is to determine whether or not a business is affected with a public interest (which is said to be the equivalent of a public use), then if the principle of the decision be applied to the business of farming all can see to what end it leads. In view of the amount of property employed and the aggregate number of persons engaged in agriculture, and the public's absolute dependence upon that pursuit, it would follow that, farming being affected with a broad and definite public interest, the price of wheat and corn; cotton and wools; beef, pork, mutton, and poultry; fruit and vegetables,-could be fixed. Or if we take the aggregate of those who labor, and consider the public's absolute dependence upon labor, it would inevitably follow that it, too, was affected with a broad and definite public interest, and that wages in the United States of America in this 20th century could be fixed by law, just as in England between the 14th and 18th centuries. And inasmuch as the prices of agricultural products are dependent on the price of land and labor, and as the price of labor is closely related to the cost of rent and food and clothes and the comforts of life, there would be the power to take the further step and regulate the cost of everything which enters into the cost of living. Of course, it goes without saying that if the rates for fire insurance can be fixed, then the rates for life and marine insurance can be fixed. By a parity of reasoning, the rates of accident, guaranty, and fidelity insurance could also be regulated. There seems no escape from the conclusion that the asserted power to fix the price to be paid by one private person to another private person or private corporation for a private contract of indemnity, or for his product, or his labor, or for his private contracts of any sort, will become the center of a circle of price-making legislation that, in its application, will destroy the right of \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 431]\n\u00a0\n private property, and break down the barriers which the Constitution has thrown around the citizen to protect him in his right of property,-which includes his right of contract to make property,-his right to fix the price at which his property shall be used by another. By virtue of the liberty which is guaranteed by the Constitution, he also has the right to name the wage for his labor and to fix the terms of contracts of indemnity,- whether they be contracts of indorsement or suretyship, or contracts of indemnity against loss by fire, flood, or accident.\n In view of what Judge Cooley calls the general supposition that 'the right to fix prices was inconsistent with constitutional liberty,' it is not surprising that little is to be found in the books relating to a statute like this. It is, however, somewhat curious that among the few expressions to be found on the subject is the intimation by Lord Ellenborough in Allnutt v. Inglis, 12 East, 535, that insurance rates were not on the same basis as a public business using property devoted to a public use. For in answering the argument that if the rates of a public wharf could be fixed, insurance rates could also be fixed, he clearly intimates that this could not be done, since the wharf was a monopoly, and 'the business of insurance and of counting-houses may be carried on elsewhere.'\n In the following cases the statutes fixing prices have been held to be void: Ex parte Dickcy, 144 Cal. 234, 66 L.R.A. 928, 103 Am. St. Rep. 82, 77 Pac. 924, 1 Ann. Cas. 428, fixing the price to be charged by an employment bureau; Ex parte Quarg, 149 Cal. 79, 5 L.R.A.(N.S.) 183, 117 Am. St. Rep. 115, 84 Pac. 766, 9 Ann. Cas. 747; People v. Steele, 231 Ill. 340, 14 L.R.A.(N.S.) 361, 121 Am. St. Rep. 321, 83 N. E. 236, prohibiting the sale of theater tickets at a price higher than that charged by the theater; State v. Fire Creek Coal & Coke Co. 33 W. Va. 188, 6 L.R.A. 359, 25 Am. St. Rep. 891, 10 S. E. 288, limiting the profits on sales to employees. See also State v. McCool, 83 Kan. 430, bot., 111 Pac. 477, where, in sustaining a statute regulating the weight of bread, the court called attention to the fact that the statute did not attempt to fix the price. To these could be added a multitude of decisions showing that the power \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 432]\n\u00a0\n to regulate is limited by the constitutional prohibition against the taking of private property. Guillotte v. New Orleans, 12 La. Ann. 432, is the only American case found which sustains the right to fix prices for other than a commodity or service furnished by a public utility company of the kind already pointed out. In that case the court said that the city could fix the price of bread, and that if the baker did not desire to do business within the limits of such city, he could go elsewhere. That reasoning would support any statute, for every citizen at least has the right to go out of business. But it has been repeatedly held by this court that such an answer cannot sustain an invalid statute, the Constitution being intended to secure the citizen against being driven out of business by an unconstitutional statute or regulation.\n There is, in the opinion, an allusion to usury laws as instances of fixing rates for other than public service corporations. We do not understand that the opinion is founded on that proposition, for even the usury laws do not fix a flat rate, but only a maximum rate, and do not require lenders to make loans to all borrowers, similarly situated, at the same rate of interest. Moreover, interest laws were in their inception not a restriction upon the right of contract, but an enlargement, permitting what theretofore had been regarded both as an ecclesiastical and civil offense. This fact may have been coupled with the idea that as the sovereign had the prerogative to coin money and make legal tender for all claims, he could fix the price that should be charged for the use of that money.\n At any rate, interest laws had been long recognized before the Constitution, and have been prevalent ever since. They therefore fall within the rule that contemporary practice, if subsequently continued and universally acquiesced in, amounts to an interpretation of the Constitution. But the same character of long-continued ac- \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 433]\n\u00a0\n quiescence and settled usage that sustains a usury law also sustains the right of the contracting parties to agree upon the charge for insurance. For centuries before the Constitution, and continuously ever since, they have themselves fixed this charge, and this makes most strongly in favor of their right to continue to agree upon the price of a private contract of indemnity against loss by fire.\n The act now under review not only takes property without due process of law, but it unequally and arbitrarily selects those from which such property shall be taken by price fixing. Although including all other fire insurance companies, it excepts certain mutual insurance companies. Persons engaged in doing an insurance business are not within its terms. In Kansas, the right to do a fire insurance business is not limited to corporations, but may be conducted by persons, individuals, partners, companies, and associations, whether incorporated or not. Gen. Stat. (Kan .) (1909)  4086, 4091, 4122. And if it could be true that the legislature could fix the price of insurance, it would seem to be doubly necessary that all doing an insurance business should be treated alike. There is no difference in principle and none by statute in the character of the contract, whether it is made by one man, or the Lloyds, or a corporation. There is no difference in the character of the contract made by a stock company and a mutual company. In each instance the contract is one of indemnity against loss for a fixed premium. If the policy holder is a stockholder in an ordinary corporation, he may get back some of his premium by way of dividends; if he is a member of a mutual company, he pays his premium and gets back his share of the earnings. But to say that the state may fix the price to be charged for insurance by a stock company, and that it will not fix the price to be charged by mutual companies or by the Lloyds, who do an enormous business of exactly the same nature, on exactly \n\n[233 U.S. 389, 434]\n\u00a0\n the same sort of property, and on exactly the same terms, is to make a discrimination which amounts to a denial of the equal protection of the law.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice Van Devanter concur in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","74":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGILA VALLEY, G. & N. RY. CO. v. HALL(1914)\nNo. 68\nArgued: Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 94, 95]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Eugene S. Ives for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 94, 97]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. H. Thomas for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a review of a judgment of the supreme court of Arizona, rendered prior to statehood, affirming the judgment of one of the territorial district courts, in an action brought by Hall against the railway company, to recover damages for personal injuries. Hall was in the employ of the company as chainman, and on April 23, 1907, was engaged, with another employee named Ryan, in measuring distances for locating mileposts along the line of its railway. For purposes of transportation they used a three-wheeled gasolene car or 'velocipede' furnished by the company. This car had two wheels on the right-hand side, over which were the engine, a seat for the use of the operator, and a seat in front for another person; the third wheel-or 'pony wheel,' as it was called-was a small wheel on the left-hand side nearly opposite the front wheel on the right-hand side, and fastened to the machine by a bar extending across. The wheels, like the ordinary car wheel, had inside flanges designed to keep the treads of the wheels upon the tracks. On the day mentioned, Hall and Ryan were upon this car, traveling upon the line of railway, Ryan operating the machine and Hall sitting in front. While running at a speed of from 8 to 12 miles an hour, the car suddenly left the track, going to the left, the side on which the 'pony wheel' was located. Hall was thrown in front and run over, sustaining severe injuries. The ground relied upon to support a recovery of damages from the employer was that the flange upon the third wheel was worn and cracked in a manner that rendered its use dangerous; that the defect was of such a \n\n[232 U.S. 94, 98]\n\u00a0\n character that it would have been discovered in the course of reasonable inspection; and that by reason of this defect the machine left the track. The company denied negligence on its part, set up contributory negligence, and averred that Hall knew or had opportunity to know the condition of the car, and that he assumed the risk of injury resulting from the alleged defect. Upon the trial the jury returned a verdict in his favor for $10, 000. The company moved for a new trial, and, pending this motion, Hall voluntarily remitted $5,000 from the amount of the verdict. Thereafter the trial court denied the motion, and entered judgment in Hall's favor for $5, 000 and costs. From this judgment and from the order denying the motion for a new trial the company appealed to the territorial supreme court, which affirmed the judgment, as already stated. 13 Ariz. 270, 112 Pac. 845, 1 N. C. C. A. 362.\n This writ of error is sued out by the railway company and the sureties upon the supersedeas bond that was given for the purposes of the appeal to the territorial supreme court. A reversal of the judgment is sought because of alleged trial errors.\n At the outset we lay aside certain assignments of error filed in this court that are designed to raise various questions which do not appear, from anything in the record before us, to have been presented to the territorial supreme court for its consideration. It is inadmissible for this court to consider errors, not fundamental in their character, which might have been, but were not, brought under review in the appellate court below; for it is that court's judgment which is alone subject to our review. The impropriety of allowing a party, conceiving himself to have suffered from an erroneous ruling of a trial court in a matter not jurisdictional, nor essential to the foundation of the action, but involving a mere matter of procedure, to invoke the judgment of this court thereon, without availing himself of the opportunity for a review \n\n[232 U.S. 94, 99]\n\u00a0\n thereof in the appropriate appellate court of the territory, has been repeatedly pointed out.

Rep. 113.\n The local practice required specific assignments of error, and treated errors not thus assigned as being waived. Arizona Rev. Stat. 1901 , 1523 and 1586; Supreme Court Rules 3 and 6; 4 Ariz. ix. and xi., 35 Pac. vi. and vii.; Daggs v. Phoenix Nat. Bank, 5 Ariz. 409, 415, 53 Pac. 201; Santa Cruz County v. Barnes, 9 Ariz. 42, 49, 76 Pac. 621; Bail v. Hartman, 9 Ariz. 321, 327, 83 Pac. 358. The transcript filed here does not contain the assignments of error below, so that there is nothing to show what errors were assigned or relied upon in the territorial supreme court, except as they receive particular mention in its opinion. Confining our attention to these, the questions presented are the following:\n First, it is contended that the trial court ought to have instructed the jury to return a verdict in favor of the defendant, and this upon the ground that there was no evidence to sustain a recovery, unless it could be found in the proof of the defective condition of the flange of the 'pony wheel;' it being at the same time contended to be a physical impossibility that this defect in the flange could have caused the accident. The wheel itself was in evidence as an exhibit, and it was testified that the inside of the flange, where it came next to the rail, was irregularly worn; or, as a witness put it,-'cut in different places so that it is very rough, and it would have a tendency (for a person to look at it) to show hard and soft places in the wheel.' This witness declared that this condition of the wheel would cause it to 'bounce and leave the track.' Another witness testified that there were 'three gouged-out places' in the flange, and (in effect) that if one of these should strike a protruding joint between rails \n\n[232 U.S. 94, 100]\n\u00a0\n 'the sharp edge of the flange would mount that rail and go off.' It is insisted, however, that by the uncontroverted testimony the car, at the time of the accident, was traveling upon a curve towards the left, and was therefore necessarily impelled by centrifugal force towards the right, so that the defective flange was drawn away from the rail and was performing no function. The theory is that the centrifugal force must have kept the right-hand wheels constantly bearing upon the inside of the outer or right- hand rail, and that therefore, in the absence of some extraneous cause, it was impossible for the car to be thrown toward the left, We are unable to say as a conclusion of law, that such a car, while running upon a curve towards the left, at a speed of from 8 to 12 miles an hour, and with interior flanges upon the right-hand wheels preventing it from leaving the track on that side, would not be occasionally thrown with a lurch away from the right-hand rail and against the opposite rail, even were the car at the time traveling upon a constant curve. But however this may be, there was evidence from which the jury might reasonably infer that at the point where the car left the track it was just leaving the curve and going upon a tangent. At this point it might naturally be subjected to a lurch that would throw its weight with momentum against the left-hand rail, and thus bring into operation the tendency of the 'pony wheel' to mount the rail because of the worn condition of the inside of the flange. And, as already mentioned, the car in fact went off the track towards the left. Therefore, upon this question, the case was properly submitted to the jury.\n The motion for direction of a verdict seems to have been rested upon the additional ground that the alleged defect was so obvious that its existence must have been known to the plaintiff, and that he therefore assumed the risk. There was no direct evidence that he knew of the defect, \n\n[232 U.S. 94, 101]\n\u00a0\n and it does not appear to have been a part of his duties to inspect the machine or the wheel, or to look after their condition. He had been employed for only three or four days in work that required him to ride upon the car, and at the utmost it was a question for the jury whether the defective condition of the wheel was so patent that he should be presumed to have known of it. And then, the question whether the defect was such as to render the use of the car dangerous was in dispute at the trial; hence, it could not be properly held that the risk was indisputably obvious, even to one who knew of the defect. It is quite clear, therefore, that a verdict could not properly have been directed in favor of the defendant upon the ground that the plaintiff, in using the car, had assumed an obvious risk.\n There was a request for instructions to the effect that the plaintiff assumed the risk of injury from defects which he knew, or by the exercise of ordinary care in the discharge of his duties might have known, or which he had opportunity to know. These instructions the court refused to give, but charged the jury upon this question:\n'The true test is not in the exercise of ordinary care to discover dangers, by the employee, but whether the defect is known or plainly observable by him. An employee is not charged by law with the assumption of a risk arising out of defective appliances provided by his employer, unless his employment was of such a nature as to bring to his attention and cause him to realize and comprehend the dangers incident to the use of such appliances.' This, we think, was a correct instruction under the circumstances of the case. An employee assumes the risk of dangers normally incident to the occupation in which he voluntarily engages, so far as these are not attributable to the employer's negligence. But the employee has a right to assume that his employer has exercised proper care with respect to providing a safe \n\n[232 U.S. 94, 102]\n\u00a0\n place of work, and suitable and safe appliances for the work, and is not to be treated as assuming the risk arising from a defect that is attributable to the employer's negligence, until the employee becomes aware of such defect, or unless it is so plainly observable that he may be presumed to have known of it. Moreover, in order to charge an employee with the assumption of a risk attributable to a defect due to the employer's negligence, it must appear not only that he knew (or is presumed to have known) of the defect, but that he knew it endangered his safety; or else such danger must have been so obvious that an ordinarily prudent person, under the circumstances, would have appreciated it.

Rep. 673.\n\n The next error alleged is the refusal of the trial court to permit Ryan, the operator of the car, to testify to a remark made, concerning the condition of the wheel, on the day before the accident. Ryan had testified that he noticed the alleged defect at the time referred to; that he, and Hall, and one Regna, and somebody else, were present; that a conversation was had in which Regna made a remark with respect to the crack in the wheel; and that this remark was made in his natural tone of voice while Hall was less than 20 yards away and within hearing distance, and so that he could have heard it if he had been listening. It was not shown that Hall made any comment upon the car or the wheel, or made any answer to Regna's remark, or took any part in the conversation. Plaintiff's counsel objected to the admission of the conversation on the ground that it had not been established that Hall heard it, and this objection was sustained.\n It is insisted that the conversation was admissible as \n\n[232 U.S. 94, 103]\n\u00a0\n proving notice to Hall of the condition of the wheel; and so it was, provided it appeared that he heard it. Whether he did hear it was, of course, a question of fact. Plaintiff in error contends that this should have been submitted to the jury, with an instruction that if they believed Hall heard the conversation, they might take that into consideration in determining whether he knew the condition of the wheel and the effect of using it in that condition.\n We agree that the testimony was such as to render it a matter of doubtful inference whether Hall heard the conversation; but we think this question of fact was one to be determined by the trial court, and not by the jury. Questions of the admissibility of evidence are for the determination of the court; and this is so whether its admission depend upon matter of law or upon matter of fact. And the finding of the trial judge upon such a preliminary question of fact is not subject to be reversed on appeal or error if it be fairly supported by the evidence, as it is in the case before us.

Riggs, 1 Pet. 591, 597, 7 L. ed. 275, 277.\n Finally, it is insisted that there was error in entering judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $5,000, after the residue of the verdict of $10, 000 was remitted pending the motion for new trial. The argument is that the voluntary remission of so large an amount by the plaintiff was an admission that the verdict was excessive; that an excessive verdict may not be cured by a remitter where the amount of the damages cannot be measured by any fixed standard or determined with certainty; that a verdict so excessive \n\n[232 U.S. 94, 104]\n\u00a0\n is conclusive evidence that it was the product of prejudice on the part of the jury, and that this vice goes to the entire verdict, and not merely to the excess. The practice, however, is recognized by the Civil Code (Ariz. Rev. Stat. 1901, 1450 and 1451), which permit any party in whose favor a verdict or judgment has been rendered to remit any part thereof, after which execution shall issue for the balance only of such judgment. In Northern P. R. Co. v. Herbert, \n116 \nU.S. 642, 646\n, 29 S. L. ed. 755, 758, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 590, an action in a territorial court to recover damages for personal injuries that necessitated the amputation of a leg, there was a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $25,000, a motion for a new trial on various grounds, among others that the damages were excessive, and the court ordered that a new trial be granted unless plaintiff remitted $15, 000 of the verdict, and, in case he did so, that the motion should be denied. He remitted the amount, and judgment was entered in his favor for the balance, which the supreme court of the territory affirmed. This court held that the matter was within the discretion of the court; and this even without the sanction of a statute. The constitutional question involved was re-examined in Arkansas Valley Land & Cattle Co. v. Mann, \n130 \nU.S. 69, 73\n, 32 S. L. ed. 854, 855, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 458, and the decision in the Herbert Case was adhered to, it being held that the practice under criticism did not in any just sense impair the right of trial by jury.\n In Southern P. Co. v. Tomlinson, 4 Ariz. 126, 132, 33 Pac. 710, and in Southern P. Co. v. Fitchett, 9 Ariz. 128, 134, 80 Pac. 359, the general practice was sustained by the territorial supreme court. In the former case, however, it was said (4 Ariz. 132) that 'if it is apparent to the trial court that the verdict was the result of passion or prejudice, a remittitur should not be allowed, but the verdict should be set asied. In passing upon this question the court should not look alone to the amount of the damages awarded, but to the whole case.' In the Fitchett \n\n[232 U.S. 94, 105]\n\u00a0\n Case, it appearing that the trial court was of the opinion that more than half of the damages awarded for the appellee's injured feelings were excessive, the supreme court held that evidently the verdict was not the result of cool and dispassionate consideration, and that the question of the proper sum to be awarded ought not to have been determined by the trial court, but should have been submitted to the determination of another jury. In the present case (13 Ariz. 276, 112 Pac. 845, 1 N. C. C. A. 362) the majority of the court declared they were not prepared to adhere to the views expressed in the Fitchett Case; that while there is authority for the position that in no case of unliquidated damages should the court permit a remission where the verdict is excessive, without the consent of the defendant, the great weight of authority supports the practice; citing the decisions of this court already referred to; and declaring that while, if it appears that the verdict is tainted with prejudice or passion, and does not represent the dispassionate judgment of the jury upon the question of the right of the plaintiff to recover, a new trial should be granted, yet the trial court is in a better position to determine this than the appellate court, so that its determination should ordinarily be accepted. We see no ground for disturbing this decision.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","75":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGILSON v. U.S.(1914)\nNo. 207\nArgued: Decided: June 8, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 380, 381]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wade H. Ellis, Ira P. Englehart, Allen S. Davis, and George B. Holden for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Knaebel and Mr. S. W. Williams for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an equity action brought by the United States against appellant to cancel a patent issued to one Daniel \n\n[234 U.S. 380, 382]\n\u00a0\n Landis for a tract of 120 acres of land in Yakima county, in the state of Washington, afterwards conveyed by Landis to appellant. Landis made a homestead entry in November, 1899, under  2289 of the Revised Statutes as amended by act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 1098, chap. 561, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1388); in November, 1902, he commuted the entry and purchased the land under  2301 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1406), as amended by the same act; and in July, 1903, he received a patent. Upon the day on which he made the commutation entry he gave a mortgage upon the land to appellant, and from that date ceased to live upon it, and as soon as the patent was issued he made the conveyance to appellant. The grounds of the action were: that Landis did not enter the land in good faith, but for the purpose and with the intent of acquiring title to it for appellant and at his instigation; that the residence and improvements were not sufficient; that the affidavit upon which Landis's original application was allowed was false and fraudulent, in that he did not make the application in good faith for the purpose of actual settlement and cultivation, but made it for the benefit of appellant, with whom the entryman was then acting in collusion for the purpose of giving to appellant the benefit of the entry; that the proof of settlement and cultivation offered in support of the commutation entry was false and fraudulent, in that the entryman had not made settlement in November, 1899, or at any other time; had not built a house, except a partially completed shanty; had not resided on the land, and had not broken 13 acres and cultivated 3 acres, as alleged in his final proofs; and that the statement made in his affidavit that he had not alienated any part of the land was also false, in that he had alienated or agreed to alienate it to appellant.\n The trial court found that Landis made the homestead entry at appellant's instigation and for his benefit; that the evidence on which the register and receiver allowed \n\n[234 U.S. 380, 383]\n\u00a0\n the commutation entry included sworn statements by Landis and two witnesses to the effect that the claimant had lived continuously on the land and made improvements, including a corral and chicken house, and that he had cultivated 3 acres for three seasons; that this was a false statement, there having been no plowing or cultivation except during the third year; that the land was dry sage-brush land, not productive without irrigation; that Landis made only a pretense of settlement and a show of improving the land, in order to satisfy the scruples of the witnesses upon whom he depended to make final proof; and further, that appellant was cognizant of every detail of the transaction from its inception to the issuance of patent, and, indeed, directed the proceedings at every step, and therefore could not claim to be a bona fide purchaser.\n The circuit court of appeals concurred in this view of the facts, and therefore sustained the conclusion reached by the trial court that the patent should be canceled, without finding it necessary to consider the question of law, suggested by appellant, that, inasmuch as final proof was not made under  2291 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1390), but under  2301 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1406), the fact that the claimant had made an agreement before commutation to convey the land to another would not affect the validity of the title obtained from the United States, because  2301 prescribes as requisite to commutation, proof only that the entryman has made settlement, cultivation, and residence for fourteen months, and does not require him to make oath that he has not alienated any portion of the land. The decree was affirmed (107 C. C. A. 584, 185 Fed. 484), and the present appeal was taken.\n Upon the question of fact as to the fraudulent nature of the proof upon which the commutation entry was allowed, we have the concurring findings of two courts, which, according to the settled rule, will not be disturbed by this court unless clearly shown to be erroneous. Stuart \n\n[234 U.S. 380, 384]\n\u00a0\n v. Hayden, \n169 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 42 S. L. ed. 639, 643, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 274; Towson v. Moore, \n173 \nU.S. 17, 24\n, 43 S. L. ed. 597, 600, 19 Sup. Ct.

United States, decided May 25, 1914 [\n234 U.S. 76\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 725.]\n In behalf of appellant it is urged that this rule does not apply where the evidence is taken before an examiner, as was done in this case. The rule, however, is subject to no such exception; indeed, prior to the adoption of the new Equity Rules (\n226 U.S. 13\n, Appx. 57 L. ed. 1645, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. xxxi., Rule 46), the evidence in equity actions was usually taken before a master or examiner. And in Texas & P. R. Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n232 U.S. 338\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 438, where the findings of the special master who heard the testimony were set aside by the circuit court, and the conclusions of that court were concurred in by the circuit court of appeals, we deemed the case a proper one for applying the general rule.\n In the present case, not only does the argument submitted in behalf of appellant fail to show clear ground for disturbing the concurring findings of the two courts, but it raises no reasonable doubt of their correctness.\n This renders it unnecessary to deal with the question raised as to the effect of an agreement for alienation made after entry and before commutation. However, it is settled adversely to the contention of appellant by our recent decision in Bailey v. Sanders, \n228 \nU.S. 603, 608\n, 57 S. L. ed. 985, 988, 33 Sup. Ct.

Parker, Jackson H. Ralston, Frederick L. Siddons, and William E. Richardson for Gompers et al.\n Messrs. J. J. Darlington, Daniel Davenport, Clarence R. Wilson, and James M. Beck for defendant in error and appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court;\n These are proceedings for alleged criminal contempts in the matter that was before this court in Gompers v. Buck's \n\n[233 U.S. 604, 606]\n\u00a0\n Stove & Range Co. \n221 U.S. 418\n, 55 L. ed. 797, 34 L.R.A. (N.S.) 874, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 492. In that case the proceedings instituted by the Buck's Stove & Range Company to punish the petitioners were ordered to be dismissed, but without prejudice to the power of the supreme court of the District to punish contempt, if any, committed against it. The decision was rendered on May 15, 1911, and the next day the supreme court of the District appointed a committee to inquire whether there was reasonable cause to believe the plaintiffs in error guilty, in wilfully violating an injunction issued by that court on December 18, 1907, and, if year, to present and prosecute charges to that effect. The inquiry was directed solely with a view to punishment for past acts, not to secure obedience for the future; and to avoid repetition it will be understood that all that we have to say concerns proceedings of this sort only, and further, only proceedings for such contempt not committed in the presence of the court.\n The committee, on June 26, 1911, reported and charged that the parties severally were guilty of specified acts in violation of the injunction, being the same acts of which they had been found guilty by the supreme court in the former case. Rules to show cause were issued on the same day. The defendants pleaded the statute of limitations, Rev. Stat.  1044, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 725, as to most of the charges, and not guilty. There was a trial, the statute of limitations was held inapplicable, and the defendants were found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment for terms of different lengths, subject to exceptions which by agreement was embodied in a single bill. The court of appeals reduced the sentences to imprisonment for thirty days in the case of Gompers and fines of $500 for each of the other two. 40 App. D. C. 293. The defendants brought a writ of error and an appeal to this court, and also petitioned for a writ of certiorari. Of course, an appeal does not lie, nor does a writ of error, but the writ of certiorari is granted. \n\n[233 U.S. 604, 607]\n\u00a0\n The judges of the supreme court also petitioned for a writ of certiorari, but as the case will be disposed of on the first-mentioned petition, the other will be denied.\n The injunction, subsequently held too broad, not only forbade the defendants to combine to obstruct the business of the Buck's Stove & Range Company, or to declare or threaten any boycott against it (such a boycott already having been declared), but also to publish any statement calling attention of any body to any such boycott, or any statement of like effect, tending to any injury of the company's business. This decree, although made on December 18, did not become operative until December 23, 1907. Before going to the court of appeals the injunction in substantially the same form was made permanent on March 23, 1908. It may be assumed for the purposes of our decision that the evidence not only warranted but required a finding that the defendants were guilty of some, at least, of the violations of this decree that were charged against them, and so we come at once to consider the statute of limitations, which is their only real defense. A preliminary objection was urged, to be sure, that the question of the validity of that defense was not reserved, but there is nothing in it. The bar was pleaded, there was a motion to dismiss on that ground for want of a replication, there was a decision that the statute did not apply to contempts, and the counsel for the plaintiffs in error stated at the trial that there was one general exception presented on their behalf with regard to that. We cannot doubt that it was perfectly understood, or that the record shows that the plaintiffs in error preserved all their rights.\n The statute provides that 'no person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any offense not capital, except . . . , unless the indictment is found or the information is instituted within three years next after such offense shall have been committed.' Rev. Stat.  1044, act of April 13, 1876, chap. 56, 19 Stat. at L. 32, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 725. The plaintiffs in \n\n[233 U.S. 604, 608]\n\u00a0\n error treat these proceedings as having begun on May 16, 1911, when the supreme court directed an inquiry. They certainly did not begin before that date; so that, if the statute applies, contempts prior to May 16, 1908, would be barred. It is argued with force that the inquiry was directed only to breaches of the preliminary injunction, which expired by its own terms upon the making of the final decree on March 23, 1908, and that therefore everything legitimately before the court happened more than three years before. But as the report mentioned the final decree, and charged a few acts later than March 23, though mostly rather unimportant, and as the order to show cause referred to a violation of the injunctions, in the plural, it perhaps would savor of a technicality that we should be loath to apply on either side, if we did not deal with all that is charged.\n The charges against Gompers are: (1) hurrying the publication of the January number of the American Federationist, and distributing many copies after the injunction was known and before it went into effect, in which number the Buck's Stove & Range Company was included in the 'We don't patronize' list; (2) circulating other copies in January, 1908; (3) on and after December 23, 1907, circulating another document to the like effect with comments, some of which were lawful criticism, but others of which suggested that the injunction left the members of labor oganizations free to continue their boycott; (4) publishing in February, 1908, a copy of the decree with the suggestion that those who violated the injunction outside of the District could not be punished unless they came within it; (5) in January and February, 1908, publishing in conjunction with the other defendants a paper appealing for financial aid, commenting on the injunction as invading the liberty of the press and free speech, and reprinting the beforementioned comments and suggestions; (6) in March, 1908, again suggesting that no law compelled the purchase \n\n[233 U.S. 604, 609]\n\u00a0\n of a Buck stove; (7) in April, 1908, after the final decree, reiterating the same suggestion in the American Federationist; (8) in April, 1908, repeating similar suggestions by transparent innuendo in a public address; ( 9) again repeating them in another address, on or about May 1; (10) and again in the July issue of the American Federationist; (11) publishing in the September Federationist an editorial characterizing the injunction as an invasion of constitutional freedom (which hardly seems to exceed lawful comment unless on the ground that the case was not finished, although mistaken in its law); (12) in a report published after September 9, 1908, saying that if the Executive Council of the Federation of Labor obeyed the injunction they could not report the state of the case to the Denver Convention, and that they did not see how they could refuse to give an account of their doings; (13) on September 29, 1908, saying in a public address that the injunction forbade him to discuss the case, but that he must (seemingly not going beyond that declaration); (14) on October 26, 1908, recurring in a single phrase in an address to his old suggestion that no law compelled his hearers to buy a Buck stove; (15) in November, 1908, in an address which he caused to be published in the Federationist in January, 1909, again referring to the injunction, mentioning his past advice and suggestions, and that he had been called on to show cause why he should not be adjudged guilty of contempt (in the former proceeding), and asking how he could have done otherwise; and finally (16) in a report made in November, 1909, referring to the judge as so far having transcended his authority that even judges of the court of appeals have felt called upon to criticize his action, and saying that in such circumstances it is the duty of the citizens to refuse obedience and to take whatever consequences may ensue. The charges against Mitchell and Morrison are mainly for having taken part in some of the above-mentioned publications, but need not \n\n[233 U.S. 604, 610]\n\u00a0\n be stated particularly, as all the acts of any substance in Mitchell's case and all in that of Morrison were more than three years old when these proceedings began.\n The boycott against the company was not called off until July 19 to 29, 1910, and it is argued that, even if the statute applies, the conspiracy was continuing until that date (United States v. Kissel, \n218 \nU.S. 601, 607\n, 54 S. L. ed. 1168, 1178, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 124), and therefore that the statute did not begin to run until then. But this is not an indictment for conspiracy, it is a charge of specific acts in disobedience of an injunction. The acts are not charged as evidence, but as substantive offenses; each of them, so far as it was a contempt, was pun shable as such, and was charged as such, and therefore each must be judged by itself; and so we come to what, as we already have intimated, is the real question in the case.\n It is urged in the first place that contempts cannot be crimes, because, although punishable by imprisonment, and therefore, if crimes, infamous, they are not within the protection of the Constitution and the Amendments giving a right to trial by jury, etc., to persons charged with such crimes. But the provisions of the Constitution are not mathematical formulas having their essence in their form; they are organic, living institutions transplanted from English soil. Their significance is vital, not formal; it is to be gathered not simply by taking the words and a dictionary, but by considering their origin and the line of their growth. Robertson v. Baldwin, \n165 \nU.S. 275, 281\n, 282 S., 41 L. ed. 715, 717, 718, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 326. It does not follow that contempts of the class under consideration are not crimes, or rather, in the language of the statute, offenses, because trial by jury as it had been gradually worked out and fought out has been thought not to extend to them as a matter of constitutional right. These contempts are infractions of the law, visited with punishment as such. If such acts are not criminal, we are in error as to the most fundamental characteristic of crimes as that word has been understood in English speech. So truly are \n\n[233 U.S. 604, 611]\n\u00a0\n they crimes that it seems to be proved that in the early law they were punished only by the usual criminal procedure, 3 Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, N. S. p. 147 (1885), and that, at least in England, it seems that they still may be and preferably are tried in that way. See 7 Laws of England (Halsbury), 280, subdiv. Contempt of Court (604); Re Clements, 46 L. J. Ch. N. S. 375, 383, 36 L. T. N. S. 332; Re Macleod, 6 Jur. 461; Schreiber v. Lateward, 2 Dick. 592; Wellesley's Case, 2 Russ. & M. 639, 667; Re Pollard, L. R. 2 P. C. 106, 120, 5 Moore, P. C. C. N. S. 111; Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 38, 43, 5 L. ed. 391, 392; Bessette v. W.

L. ed. 797, 805, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 874, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 492.\n We come, then, to the construction of the statute. It has been assumed that the concluding words, 'unless the indictment is found or the information is instituted within three years' limit the offenses given the benefit of the act to those usually prosecuted in that way, and the counsel for the petitioners were at some pains to argue that the charges of the committee amounted to an information,-a matter that opens vistas of antiquarian speculation. But this question is not one to be answered by refinements and curious inquiries. In our opinion the proper interpretation of the statute begins with the substantive, not with the adjective, part. The substantive portion of the section is that no person shall be tried for any offense not capital except within a certain time. Those words are of universal scope. What follows is a natural way of expressing that the proceedings must be begun within three years; indictment and information being the usual modes by which they are begun, and very likely no other having occurred to those who drew the law. But it seems to us plain that the dominant words of the act are, 'no person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any offense not capital,' unless.\n No reason has been suggested to us for not giving to the \n\n[233 U.S. 604, 612]\n\u00a0\n statute its natural scope. The English courts seem to think it wise, even when there is much seeming reason for the exercise of a summary power, to leave the punishment of this class of contempts to the regular and formal criminal process. Re Macleod, 6 Jur. 461. Maintenance of their authority does not often make it really necessary for courts to exert their own power to punish, as is shown by the English practice in more violent days than these, and there is no more reason for prolonging the period of liability when they see fit to do so than in the case where the same offense is proceeded against in the common way. Indeed, the punishment of these offenses peculiarly needs to be speedy if it is to occur. The argument loses little of its force if it should be determined hereafter, a matter on which we express no opinion, that in the present state of the law an indictment would not lie for a contempt of a court of the United States.\n Even if the statute does not cover the case by its express words, as we think it does, still, in dealing with the punishment of crime a rule should be laid down, if not by Congress, by this court. The power to punish for contempt must have some limit in time, and in defining that limit we should have regard to what has been the policy of the law from the foundation of the government. By analogy, if not by enactment, the limit is three years. The case cannot be concluded otherwise so well as in the language of Chief Justice Marshall in a case where the statute was held applicable to an action of debt for a penalty. Adams v. Woods, 2 Cranch, 336, 340-342, 2 L. ed. 297-299: 'It is contended that the prosecutions limited by this law are those only which are carried on in the form of an indictment or information, and not those where the penalty is demanded by an action of debt. But if the words of the act be examined, they will be found to apply not to any particular mode of proceeding, but generally to any prosecution, trial, or punishment for the offense. It is not de- \n\n[233 U.S. 604, 613]\n\u00a0\n clared that no indictment shall be found . . . But it is declared that 'No person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished' . . . In expounding tried, or punished' . . . In expounding that if it does not limit actions of debt for penalties, those actions might, in many cases, be brought at any distance of time. This would be utterly repugnant to the genius of our laws. In a country where not even treason can be prosecuted after a lapse of three years, it could scarcely be supposed that an individual would remain forever liable to a pecuniary forfeiture.' The result is that the judgments, based as they are mainly upon offenses that could not be taken into consideration, must be reversed.\n Judgments reversed.\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter and Mr. Justice Pitney dissent. \n\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGRAND TRUNK WESTERN R.

Kretzinger, Jr., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 42, 44]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James C. McShane for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The right of the plaintiff, who is defendant in error here, to recover for an alleged personal injury, was stated in two counts. In both, the wrong was alleged to have been occasioned by the negligence of the railway company, while it was engaged in carrying on interstate commerce, and while the plaintiff was employed by it in such commerce. In the first count, however, the act of Congress known as the safety appliance act [27 Stat. at L. 531, chap. 196, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3174] was expressly declared on. For the purposes of the writ of error which was prosecuted by the railroad company from the circuit court of appeals, numerous assignments of error were made and were all disposed of by the court in a full opinion. 120 C. C. A. 166, 201 Fed. 836. In view of the complexion of the case as here presented we need address ourselves to only one of such assignments, and to state the facts only so far as essential to its consideration.\n The proof showed that the plaintiff was one of a crew working a switch engine, and that in a yard near Chicago such engine, coupled with four loaded freight cars, moving \n\n[233 U.S. 42, 45]\n\u00a0\n in interstate commerce, were held in order to make a coupling with a number of other loaded freight cars moving in interstate commerce, to the end that an interstate train bound eastward might be made up and depart. When by impact it was attempted to make the coupling, the cars failed to couple automatically, and after several efforts to cause them to do so, the plaintiff as switchman walked along beside the end of the car as it approached again the point of coupling, signaled to the engineer to stand fast, and entered between the cars for the purpose of ascertaining and remedying if possible the cause of the trouble. While between the cars and engaged in handling the coupler, the cars were pushed up and he was caught and his arm crushed. There was some proof tending to show that the switchman stepped in before the moving cars had entirely stopped, and some that he gave a signal to come ahead as he stepped in; but there was evidence tending to show to the contrary, and to support the inference that the act of the engineer in moving up was the result of a signal with a lantern, for it was dark, mistakenly given by some other employee in the vicinity, or a mistake of the engineer in misconceiving the movement of a lantern in the hands of some of those who were standing around. There was evidence tending to show that the coupler had been inspected shortly before the accident and no defect was observed by the inspector, but it was shown without dispute that it was defective at the time of the accident, and would not couple automatically because of a bent pin.\n Among the errors assigned in the court below was the refusal of the trial court to give an instruction relating to the action of the switchman in entering between the cars and his supposed giving of the comeahead signal. This instruction, while leaving to the jury the determination of whether the switchman, in going between the cars to examine the coupling mechanism, gave a come-ahead signal, \n\n[233 U.S. 42, 46]\n\u00a0\n nevertheless asked the court to instruct as a matter of law that if he had done so, his act was the proximate cause of his injury, and therefore he could not recover. Instead of giving this instruction the court modified it by leaving it to the jury to determine whether, under all the circumstances, the action of the switchman had been reasonably careful. The court, in its general charge on this subject, said:\n'If, after he started to go between the cars, he has done something which was carelessly done, or which you can say from a preponderance of the evidence contributed approximately to the accident, then he cannot recover. . . . If there be contributory negligence at all, it depends not upon his assuming the risk under the circumstances in evidence in this case, but upon the care with which he acted while in the performance of the work which he assumed.\n\n'You are further instructed that if you believe from the preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff gave a 'come-ahead' signal to the switchman or engineer,-one or both,-and after that went between the cars and was injured, then you have a right to consider whether the giving of the 'come-ahead' signal by the plaintiff was the proximate cause of the injury as distinguished from the condition of the coupler, and if you find that, under the circumstances, the 'come-ahead' signal was the proximate cause of the injury, then your verdict must be for the defendant.\n\n'You are also instructed that where there is a safe and a dangerous way of doing an act, and the servant uses a dangerous way and is injured thereby, he is charged with negligence on his part and may not recover.'\n\n The court below disposed of the refusal of the trial court to charge as a matter of law that there was no right to recover if the proof showed that the switchman had given the 'come-ahead' signal, upon the ground that there \n\n[233 U.S. 42, 47]\n\u00a0\n was no foundation for giving it, as there was no evidence whatever tending to show that such signal was given by the switchman. A petition for rehearing was, however, granted, and after a reargument, the particular objection concerning the charge referred to, as well as other matters, was disposed of in an additional opinion. As to the charge referred to, the court held that a mistake had been committed in the first opinion in saying that there was not any evidence tending to show that the switchman had given the 'come-ahead' signal as he entered, and therefore the ground upon which the previous ruling had been based was inadequate. It was nevertheless held that the ruling as previously made was right, because the request to charge as a matter of law that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover if it was found that he had given the 'come-ahead' signal as he entered to examine the mechanism was incompatible with the rule of comparative negligence established by the employers' liability act . [35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 911, p. 1322]. On this subject the court said:\n'If, under the employers' liability act, plaintiff's negligence, contributing with defendant's negligence to the production of the injury, does not defeat the cause of action, but only lessens the damages, and if the cause of action is established by showing that the injury resulted 'in whole or in part' from defendant's negligence, the statute would be nullified by calling plaintiff's act the proximate cause and then defeating him, when he could not be defeated by calling his act contributory negligence. For his act was the same act, by whatever name it be called. It is only when plaintiff's act is the sole cause-when defendant's act is no part of the causation-that defendant is free from liability under the act.'\n\n As in the argument at bar reliance is solely placed, except in one particular, upon error which is assumed to have arisen from the refusal of the trial court to give the charge previously referred to, and the judgment of the court \n\n[233 U.S. 42, 48]\n\u00a0\n below in approving this action of the trial court upon the theory that it was right in view of the provisions of the employers' liability act, we come to consider this subject.\n\n\n (a)\n In the trial court it is insisted the operation and effect of the employers' liability act upon the rights of the parties was not involved because that act was not in express terms referred to in the pleadings or pressed at the trial, and was hence not considered by the court in acting upon the requested charge, and therefore, it is urged, it was error in the reviewing court to test the correctness of the ruling of the trial court by the provisions of the employers' liability act instead of confining the subject exclusively to the safety appliance law and the rules of the common law governing negligence. But the want of foundation for this contention becomes apparent when it is considered that in the complaint it was expressly alleged and in the proof it was clearly established that the injury complained of was suffered in the course of the operation of interstate commerce, thus bringing the case within the employers' liability act. It is true that to avoid the irresistible consequences arising from this situation it is insisted in argument that as no express claim was made under the employers' liability act, therefore there was no right in the plaintiff to avail of the benefits of its provisions, or in the court to apply them to the case before it. But this simply amounts to saying that the employers' liability act may not be applied to a situation which is within its provisions unless in express terms the provisions of the act be formally invoked. Aside from its manifest unsoundness, considered as an original proposition, the contention is not open, as it was expressly foreclosed in Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Duvall, \n225 \nU.S. 477, 482\n, 56 S. L. ed. 1171, 1174, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 790.\n\n\n (b)\n Coming to consider the proposition that although the case be governed by the employers' liability act error \n\n[233 U.S. 42, 49]\n\u00a0\n was nevertheless committed in sustaining the action of the trial court in refusing to give the requested instruction, we think that even if, for the sake of the argument, it be assumed that the proof brought the case within the principle of comparative negligence established by the employers' liability act, the correctness of the ruling of the court below is clearly made manifest by the reasoning given by the court for its conclusion. But having regard to the state of the proof as to the defect in the coupling mechanism, its failure to automatically work by impact after several efforts to bring about that result, all of which preceded the act of the switchman in going between the cars, in the view most favorable to the railroad, the case was one of concurring negligence; that is, was one where the injury complained of was caused both by the failure of the railway company to comply with the safety appliance act and by the contributing negligence of the switchman in going between the cars. Under this condition of things it is manifest that the charge of the court was greatly more favorable to the defendant company than was authorized by the statute for the following reasons: Although by the 3d section of the employers' liability act a recovery is not prevented in a case of contributory negligence, since the statute substitutes for it a system of comparative negligence, whereby the damages are to be diminished in the proportion which his negligence bears to the combined negligence of himself and the carrier,-in other words, the carrier is to be exonerated from a proportional part of the damages corresponding to the amount of negligence attributable to the employee (Norfolk & W. R. Co. v. Earnest, \n229 \nU.S. 114, 122\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1096, 1101, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 654),- nevertheless, under the terms of a proviso to the section, contributory negligence on the part of the employee does not operate even to diminish the recovery where the injury has been occasioned in part by the failure of the carrier to comply with the exactions of an act of Congress \n\n[233 U.S. 42, 50]\n\u00a0\n enacted to promote the safety of employees. In that contingency the statute abolishes the defense of contributory negligence, not only as a bar to recovery, but for all purposes. The proviso reads:\n'Provided, That no such employee who may be injured or killed shall be held to have been guilty of contributory negligence in any case where the violation by such common carrier of any statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury or death of such employee.'\n\n The only other objection pressed in the argument at bar concerns an instruction asked and refused by the trial court with reference to the weight to be attributed to the testimony of a car inspector who inspected the coupler in question before the accident. The subject of this asserted error was evidently carefully considered by the trial court and was adversely disposed of by the court below, both in its original and in the opinion on the rehearing. Under these circumstances, without going into detail, in view of the doctrine to be applied to cases of this character as announced in Chicago Junction R. Co. v. King, \n222 U.S. 222\n, 56 L. ed. 173, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 79; Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Brown, \n229 U.S. 317\n, 57 L. ed. 1204, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 840, 3 N. C. C. A. 826, we are of the opinion that we need do no more than say that after a careful examination of the subject, we are of the opinion that no reversible error was committed by the court below, and its judgment is therefore affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","78":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGRANNIS v.

We shall therefore discuss the record in the latter case, without further mention of No. 326.\n On the 8th day of November, 1985, and for some time prior thereto, one John McKinley was the owner of an undivided fifth part of certain lands in the county of St. Louis, in the state of Minnesota. Prior to that \n\n[234 U.S. 385, 387]\n\u00a0\n time one Albert B. Geilfuss, assignee, recovered a judgment for the sum of $ 2,854.02 against McKinley in the district court of that county, which was duly entered in the judgment book and appeared in the judgment roll in the name of Albert B. Geilfuss, assignee, and on the 5th day of January, 1894, was docketed by the clerk of the court as in favor of Albert Geilfuss, assignee, as judgment creditor, and against John McKinley as judgment debtor, and being so docketed became a lien upon McKinley's interest in said lands, and on November 8, 1895, was a lien thereon. Under a sale afterwards made upon an execution issued on this judgment, plaintiff in error claims title to the undivided one fifth of said lands formerly owned by McKinley, by virtue of certain proceedings and conveyances hereinafter mentioned. Albert B. Geilfuss, assignee, recovered another judgment against McKinley for the sum of $2,125.60, which was duly entered and docketed on January 10, 1894, and became a lien upon the interest of McKinley in the same lands, but plaintiff in error claims no rights thereunder.\n On November 8, 1895, one George A. Elder, the owner of an undivided fifth interest in said lands, commenced a partition suit in the district court of St. Louis county against Mesaba Land Company, John McKinley, and the other owners of the fee, and also against certain other parties having judgment or other liens. The suit was brought under the provisions of chapter 74, Gen. Stat. Minnesota, and its sole purpose was to partition the lands, or, in case a partition could not be had, then to have them sold and the proceeds of the sale distributed among the parties entitled.\n At the time of the partition action, Albert B. Geilfuss assignee resided at Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His correct name, 'Albert B. Geilfuss, assignee,' or 'Albert Geilfuss, assignee,' did not appear among the names of the defendants in the action, or in the summons or other files \n\n[234 U.S. 385, 388]\n\u00a0\n or records therein. 'Albert Guilfuss, assignee,' was named as a defendant, and it was alleged in the complaint, and found and determined in the findings and judgment, that he was the owner of the judgment for $2,854.02 against McKinley. 'Albert B. Guilfuss' was also named as a defendant, and it was alleged in the complaint and found and determined in the findings and judgment that he was the owner of the judgment for $2,125.60 against McKinley. There was no personal service of the summons in the partition action upon Geilfuss, however named, either as individual or as assignee, and no appearance in his behalf. There was a return by the sheriff of St. Louis county upon the summons to the effect that the defendants, 'Albert Guilfuss, assignee,' and 'Albert B. Guilfuss' could not be found in the county, and an affidavit of one of the attorneys of plaintiff was filed, stating that he believed that the defendants 'Albert Guilfuss, assignee,' and 'Albert B. Guilfuss,' were not residents of the state of Minnesota, and could not be found therein, and that after the commencement of the action affiant had deposited copies of the summons in the postoffice, with postage prepaid, directed to each of these defendants at their respective places of residence; to wit, one to Albert Guilfuss, assignee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and one to Albert B. Guilfuss, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and stating that the subject of said partition action was certain real property situated in the county of St. Louis and state of Minnesota, and that each of said defendants had and claimed a lien and interest in said real estate, and that the relief demanded in said action consisted in excluding the defendants and each of them from any interest or lien therein. There was also service of the summons by publication upon the defendants named therein as 'Albert Guilfuss, assignee,' and 'Albert B. Guilfuss,' the summons being published in a legal newspaper in Duluth, which is in St. Louis county, Minnesota. It is admitted \n\n[234 U.S. 385, 389]\n\u00a0\n that (saving the effect of the misnomer), the statutory provisions respecting the service of summons upon nonresidents by mailing and publication were complied with. These are contained in Minnesota Statutes 1894,  5204 and 5205 (respecting civil actions), and in  5771 and 5773 ( respecting actions for partition of real property). \n Leave granted on June 22, 1914, to present petition for rehearing within thirty days. \n\n[234 U.S. 385, 390]\n\u00a0\n All of the defendants in the action were properly served with summons, except as mentioned, and in due course a judgment was entered on May 5, 1899, adjudging and decreeing the ownership of the lands, and that they could not be divided and partitioned, and ordering that they be sold by a referee to the highest bidder, and the proceeds distributed among the defendants according to their respective rights under the law. The sale was made accordingly and confirmed by the court, and thereafter the present defendants in error, by mesne conveyances, acquired such interest in the lands as had been acquired by the purchaser under the referee's sale.\n Subsequently the Geilfuss judgment against McKinley, docketed January 5, 1894, for the sum of $2,854.02, was assigned to one Timlin, and by him to one Buell, and whatever interest in the land, if any, remained in McKinley after the partition sale, was sold under execution and purchased by Buell, and subsequently acquired through mesne conveyances by the present plaintiff in error.\n This action (No. 325) was brought by defendants in error to determine the adverse claims in the lands. The trial resulted in a judgment to the effect that the plaintiffs \n\n[234 U.S. 385, 391]\n\u00a0\n were the owners of an undivided four-fifths interest, and that the present plaintiff in error was the owner of the undivided fifth interest which had been the property of McKinley. Upon appeal, the supreme court reversed the judgment so far as it adjudged plaintiff in error to be the owner of McKinley's interest. 118 Minn. 117, -- L.R.A. (N.S.) --, 136 N. W. 575, 1026. By the present writ of error we are called upon to determine whether the supreme court of Minnesota, by its judgment giving effect to the decree in the partition suit, notwithstanding the misnomer of Albert B. Geilfuss, assignee, in the proceedings and summons, has deprived plaintiff in error of his property without due process of law, contrary to the 14th Amendment.\n The trial court held that no jurisdiction was acquired in the partition suit over the judgment lien of Albert B. Geilfuss, assignee, and the supreme court declared that if this were correct, the lien of his judgment upon the McKinley interest was not affected by the decree in that action, and that the subsequent sale of that interest under execution on the judgment gave a good title to the purchaser, under whom defendant (now plaintiff in error) claims; while, on the other hand, if the court acquired jurisdiction over that judgment lien, the McKinley interest in the lands passed to the purchaser at the partition sale, and afterwards became the property of plaintiffs (now defendants in error). This was upon the assumption that the court had jurisdiction to decree a sale in the partition action,-a question of state law arising out of facts not here pertinent, and to which an affirmative answer was given in the same opinion.\n The precise question now presented, therefore, is whether, under the circumstances, a service by the publication and mailing of a summons in the partition suit, naming as party and addressee 'Albert Guilfuss, assignce,' and 'Albert B. Guilfuss,' constituted due process of law, conferring jurisdiction to render a judgment binding \n\n[234 U.S. 385, 392]\n\u00a0\n upon Albert B. Geilfuss, assignee, with respect to his lien upon or interest in the land, he not having appeared.\n There is a motion to dismiss, upon the ground that the Federal question was not properly raised in the state court. This motion must be denied. It is true that until the decision of the supreme court of the state, the Federal right was not clearly asserted. But it was not infringed in the trial court, which held in favor of the contention of defendant (now plaintiff in error) that the decree in the partition suit was not valid because of the insufficiency of the notice to Geilfuss. It was the decision of the supreme court, upholding the notice, that first ran counter to the alleged Federal right. In a petition for reargument, filed by the now plaintiff in error, it was suggested that the necessary effect of the decision was to deprive him of his property without due process of law, contrary to the 14th Amendment. The supreme court entertained the petition, considered and overruled the contention that petitioner's rights under the Amendment were infringed, declared that its decision was to be interpreted as holding against the contention, and therefore refused a reargument. This is sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon this court. Mallett v. North Carolina, \n181 \nU.S. 589, 592\n, 45 S. L. ed. 1015, 1017, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 730, 15 Am. Crim. Rep. 241; Leigh v.

Rep. 171.\n We therefore proceed to the merits.\n In determining what is due process of law within the meaning of the 14th Amendment, a distinction is to be observed between actions in personam and actions in rem, or quasi in rem. In Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714, 733\n, 24 S. L. ed. 565, 572, it was held that by force of the Amendment a judgment rendered by a state court in an action in personam against a nonresident served by publication of summons, but upon whom no service of process within the \n\n[234 U.S. 385, 393]\n\u00a0\n state was made, and who did not appear to the action, was devoid of any validity, either within or without the territory of the state in which the judgment was rendered; it being, however, conceded that a different rule obtains where, in connection with initial process against a person, property in the state is brought under the control of the court and subjected to its disposition, or where the judgment is sought as a means to reach such property or affect some interest in it; in other words, where the action is in the nature of a proceeding in rem. As was said by the court (speaking by Mr. Justice Field, p. 734): 'It is true that, in a strict sense, a proceeding in rem is one taken directly against property, and has for its object the disposition of the property, without reference to the title of individual claimants; but, in a larger and more general sense, the terms are applied to actions between parties, where the direct object is to reach and dispose of property owned by them, or of some interest therein. Such are cases commenced by attachment against the property of debtors, or instituted to partition real estate, foreclose a mortgage, or enforce a lien. So far as they affect property in the state, they are substantially proceedings in rem in the broader sense which we have mentioned.'\n But it is also settled that where a state has jurisdiction over a res,- as of course it has over the partition of lands lying within its borders,- the judgment of the court to which that jurisdiction is confided, in order to be binding with respect to the interest of a nonresident who is not served with process within the state, must be based upon constructive notice given by publication, mailing, or otherwise, substantially in the manner prescribed by the law of the state.

Rep. 590; Thompson v. Thompson, \n226 \nU.S. 551, 562\n, 57 S. L. ed. 347, 351, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 129. \n\n[234 U.S. 385, 394]\n\u00a0\n In the case before us, there is no disputed question as to what steps were taken in order to give notice to Geilfuss of the partition suit. The supreme court of the state, in accepting what was done as being a sufficient compliance with the provisions of the statute, in effect construed the statute as permitting such notice to be given as was in fact given.\n But, the question whether the process thus sanctioned by the court of last resort of the state constitutes due process of law within the meaning of the 14th Amendment being properly presented to this court for decision, we must exercise an independent judgment upon it. Scott v. McNeal, \n154 \nU.S. 34, 45\n, 38 S. L. ed. 896, 901, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1108; Ballard v. Hunter, \n204 \nU.S. 241, 260\n, 51 S. L. ed. 461, 474, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 261; Jacob v. Roberts, \n223 U.S. 261\n, 56 L. ed. 429, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 303.\n The fundamental requiste of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Schmidt, \n177 \nU.S. 230, 236\n, 44 S. L. ed. 747, 750, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 620; Simon v. Craft, \n182 \nU.S. 427, 436\n, 45 S. L. ed. 1165, 1170, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 836. And it is to this end, of course, that summons or equivalent notice is employed. But the inherent authority of the states over the titles to lands within their respective borders carriers with it, of necessity, the jurisdiction to determine rights and interests claimed therein by persons resident beyond the territorial limits of the state, and upon whom the ordinary judicial process cannot be served. The logical result is that a state, through its courts, may proceed to judgment respecting the ownership of lands within its limits, upon constructive notice to the parties concerned who reside beyond the reach of process. That this constitutes 'due process' within the meaning of the 14th Amendment was recognized in Pennoyer v. Neff, supra, and is no longer open to question. Huling v. Kaw Valley R. & Improv. Co. \n130 \nU.S. 559, 563\n, 32 S. L. ed. 1045, 1047, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 603; Arndt v. Griggs, \n134 U.S. 316\n, 320, et seq., 33 L. ed. 918, 919, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 557; Lynch v. Murphy, \n161 \nU.S. 247, 251\n, 40 S. L. ed. 688, 689, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 523; Roller v. Holly, \n716 \nU.S. 398, 403\n, 44 S. L. ed. 520, 522, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410. It is not disputed that the statutory scheme of publication and mailing, as established in \n\n[234 U.S. 385, 395]\n\u00a0\n Minnesota, for giving notice to nonresident defendants in actions quasi in rem, is, in its general application, sufficient to comply with the 14th Amendment. But the statute provides that 'the summons shall be addressed by name to all the owners and lien holders who are known;' and the contention is that the mistake of name in the present instance was fatal.\n The 'due process of law' clause, however, does not impose an unattainable standard of accuracy. If a defendant within the jurisdiction is served personally with process in which his name is misspelled, he cannot safely ignore it on account of the misnomer. The rule, established by an abundant weight of authority, is, that if a person is sued by a wrong name, and he fails to appear and plead the misnomer in abatement, the judgment binds him. Lafayette Ins. Co. v. French, 18 How. 404, 409, 15 L. ed. 451, 453; Crawford v. Statchwell, 2 Strange, 1218; Oakley v. Giles, 3 East, 167; Smith v. Patten, 6 Taunt, 115, s. c. 1 Marsh. 474; Smith v. Bowker, 1 Mass. 76, 79; Root v. Fellowes, 6 Cush. 29; First Nat. Bank v. Jaggers, 31 Md. 38, 47, 100 Am. Dec. 53, 54; McGaughey v. Woods, 106 Ind. 381, 7 N. E. 7; Vogel v. Brown Twp. 112 Ind. 299, 2 Am. St. Rep. 187, 14 N. E. 77; Lindsey v. Delano, 78 Iowa, 350, 354, 43 N. W. 218; Hoffield v. Board of Education, 33 Kan. 644, 648, 7 Pac. 216.\n Of course, in a published notice or summons, intended to reach absent or nonresident defendants, where the name is a principal means of identifying the person concerned, somewhat different considerations obtain. The general rule, in cases of constructive service of process by publication, tends to strictness. Galpin v. Page, 18 Wall. 350, 369, 373, 21 L. ed. 959, 963, 965; Priest v. Las Vegas, \n232 U.S. 604\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 449. But, even in names, 'due process of law' does not require ideal accuracy. In the spelling and pronunciation of proper names there are no generally accepted standards; and the well-established doctrine of idem sonans-generally ap- \n\n[234 U.S. 385, 396]\n\u00a0\n plied, as it is, to constructive notice of suits-is a recognition of this.\n The trial court was of the opinion that the question turned upon whether 'Guilfuss' and 'Geilfuss' were idem sonans, and held that since 'Geilfuss' is evidently a German name, the first syllable must be pronounced with the long sound of 'i,' while the first syllable of 'Guilfuss' would necessarily be pronounced with the short sound of 'i.' The court therefore concluded that the names were not idem sonans, and that the difference was fatal. The supreme court agreed that 'Geilfuss' and 'Guilfuss' were not idem sonans, but held that this was not the proper test; that where a summons is served by publication, the true test is not whether the names sound the same to the ear when pronounced, but whether they look substantially the same in print (following Lane v. Innes, 43 Minn. 137, 143, 45 N. W. 4; D'Autremont v. Anderson Iron Co. (D'Autremont v. Gaylord) 104 Minn. 165, 17 L.R.A.(N.S.) 236, 124 Am. St. Rep. 615, 116 N. W. 357, 15 Ann. Cas. 114); and assuming that the name of the judgment creditor of McKinley was Albert B. Geilfuss, assignee, the court said: 'The question then is, placing the names 'Albert Guilfuss, assignee,' and 'Albert B. Geilfuss, assignee,' in juxtaposition, was there so material a change as to be misleading?' This was answered in the negative.\n Were we to theorize, we might say that while each of these tests is helpful, neither is altogether acceptable if perfect accuracy were the aim; not the test of idem sonans, because it does not appear that all persons would necessarily pronounce Geilfuss with the long 'i,' or Guilfuss with the short 'i;' and not the test of the appearance of the names as printed and placed in juxtaposition, because in fact, as the name appeared in the summons published and mailed, it was 'Guilfuss' alone, without any name in juxtaposition to serve as a standard for comparison. And we think both tests are inadequate if applied without regard to what was contained in the summons besides the mere name and addition-- 'Albert Guilfuss, as- \n\n[234 U.S. 385, 397]\n\u00a0\n signee.' The record, as it happens, contains no copy of the summons; but from findings and admissions that are in the record, we know that it was in due form, and therefore that it contained such notice of the commencement of the action and of its purpose, and such warning to appear and answer, as would constitute due process of law if served upon a defendant within the jurisdiction (Minn. Stat. 1894,  5194, 5195); and that it contained, inter alia, a brief description of the property sought to be divided (Minn. Stat. 1894,  5773, marginal note, supra). The underlying question is a practical one,-whether, notwithstanding the misnomer, the summons as published and mailed, being otherwise unexceptionable, constitutes a substantial compliance with the Minnesota statute and sufficient constructive notice to the party concerned. In determining this, we need not confine ourselves to the test of idem sonans, nor to the appearance of the name in print, but may employ both of these, with such additional tests as may be available in view of what is disclosed by the record. One such additional test, we think, is whether, when two letters reached the postoffice at Milwaukee, one addressed 'Albert Guilfuss, assignee,' the other addressed 'Albert B. Guilfuss,' they or either of them would, in reasonable probability, be delivered to Albert B. Geilfuss, then a resident of that city. Another is whether, assuming that the summons as so mailed, or as published in Duluth, and containing the misspelled names or either of them, had come to the eye of the veritable Albert B. Geilfuss, or of any person knowing him by that name, and sufficiently interested in him to acquaint him with its contents if apprised that it was intended for him, the summons, as a whole, would probably have conveyed notice that Albert B. Geilfuss was the person intended to be summoned. Both of these questions are, we think, to be answered in the affirmative. In view of the well-known skill of postal officials and employees \n\n[234 U.S. 385, 398]\n\u00a0\n in making proper delivery of letters defectively addressed, we think the presumption is clear and strong that the letters would reach-indeed, that they did reach-the true Albert B. Geilfuss in Milwaukee. And it seems to us that any person knowing him, and knowing the correct spelling of his name, and having reason to acquaint him with the contents of a notice of this character if supposed to be intended for him, would probably realize for whom such notice was intended, notwithstanding the name was spelled 'Guilfuss.' The general resemblance between the names is striking, however they are to be pronounced. And the designation 'assignee' was an additional means of identification. That Geilfuss himself, upon receiving the notice, would be sufficiently warned that it affected his interest in the Minnesota lands under his judgments against McKinley, is free from doubt. He would, of course, observe the misnomer; but, having received the notice which it was the purpose of the law to convey to him, he could not safely ignore it on the ground of the mistake in the name, any more than, if personally served with summons within the state of Minnesota, he could have ignored it on account of a similar misnomer.\n We conclude that there was due process of law in the partition suit, and that therefore the present judgment should be affirmed.\n Judgments in Nos. 325 and 326 affirmed.\n[398-Continued.]\n___ ... * * CHAPTER 74.\n Actions for the Partition of Real Property. ... * * Section 5771.

Murphey for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 647, 656]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Wallace for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n In an action of debt, tried to the court and a jury, in one of the district courts of the territory of Arizona, the United States recovered a judgment against the Grant Brothers Construction Company, a California corporation, for the prescribed penalty of $1,000 for each of forty-five alleged violations of  4 of the alien immigration act of February 20, 1907 (34 Stat. at L. 898, chap. 1134, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 499 ); and upon an appeal to the supreme court of the territory, the judgment was affirmed. 13 Ariz. 388, 114 Pac. 955. The construction company and the surety upon its supersedeas bond then sued out this writ of error, claiming that divers errors had been committed by the trial court which should have been, but were not, corrected by the appellant court. \n\n[232 U.S. 647, 657]\n\u00a0\n The portions of the statute upon which the action was founded are as follows:\n'Sec. 2. That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission into the United States: . . . persons hereinafter called contract laborers, who have been induced or solicited to migrate to this country by offers or promises of employment, or in consequence of agreements, oral, written, or printed, express or implied, to perform labor in this country of any kind, skilled or unskilled; . . . And provided further, That skilled labor may be imported if labor of like kind unemployed cannot be found in this country: And provided further, That the provisions of this law applicable to contract labor shall not be held to exclude professional actors, artists, lecturers, singers, ministers of any religious denomination, professors for colleges or seminaries, persons belonging to any recognized learned profession, or persons employed strictly as personal or domestic servants.\n\n ... * *\n'Sec. 4. That it shall be a misdemeanor for any person, company, partnership, or corporation, in any manner whatsoever, to prepay the transportation or in any way to assist or encourage the importation or migration of any contract laborer or contract laborers into the United States, unless such contract laborer or contract laborers are exempted under the terms of the last two provisos contained in section two of this act.\n\n'Sec. 5. That for every violation of any of the provisions of section four of this act the persons, partnership, company, or corporation violating the same, by knowingly assisting, encouraging, or soliciting the migration or importation of any contract laborer into the United States, shall forfeit and pay for every such offense the sum of one thousand dollars, which may be sued for and recovered by the United States, or by any person who shall first bring his action therefor in his own name and for his \n\n[232 U.S. 647, 658]\n\u00a0\n own benefit, including any such alien thus promised labor or service of any kind as aforesaid, as debts of like amount are now recovered in the courts of the United States; and separate suits may be brought for each alien thus promised labor or service of any kind as aforesaid. And it shall be the duty of the district attorney of the proper district to prosecute every such suit when brought by the United States.'\n\n The petition contained forty-five counts, each charging, with considerable detail, that the defendant, by offers and promises of employment and by providing transportation and paying expenses, assisted, encouraged, and solicited the migration and importation into the United States from Mexico of a designated alien laborer who was not within the terms of either of the last two provisos in  2 of the statute. A different alien laborer was named in each count, and the date of the offending act was given in all as October 29, 1909\n\n\n In a preliminary way, the evidence tended to show these facts: The construction company was building a line of railroad in southern Arizona, near Naco, a town on the international boundary. Laborers in large numbers were required for the work, and in August, 1909, the company employed one Carney to procure laborers for it and to take them to the vicinity of the work. For this he was to be paid $1 in gold for each laborer secured, and 20 cents for each meal provided while they were en route. It was contemplated that he would arrange with others to aid him, and he secured the assistance of Holler, Rupelius, and Randall, who, like himself, were located at Nogales, another boundary town. Under this employment Carney procured, and the company accepted, prior to the transaction in question, about 450 laborers, 95 per cent of whom were Mexicans. Many of these came across the line on their own initiative and were then engaged by Holler, but a substantial number were engaged in Mexico \n\n[232 U.S. 647, 659]\n\u00a0\n by Rupelius, and then brought into the United States at Nogales. Only a few days before the transaction in question, Rupelius gathered together 80 or 90 in Mexico, and induced them to enter the United States at Nogales by promising that the construction company would employ them, which it did.\n As respects the forty-five laborers named in the petition there was evidence tending to show the following: These men were citizens of Mexico, and were unskilled laborers who were not within the exemptions specified in the last two provisos in  2 of the statute. They were secured at Hermosillo, Mexico, by Rupelius, October 28, 1909, were brought into the United States, at Naco, by Randall the next day, were there taken into custody by an immigration inspector, and were examined before a board of special inquiry. The board found that they were alien contract laborers, ordered that they be excluded, and notified them of the order and of their right to an appeal. After consulting with the Mexican consul at Naco they waived that right, and most of them were returned to Mexico, a few being detained as witnesses. Rupelius had induced them to leave Hermosillo and come into the United States by offers and promises of employment by the construction company. They were brought to Naco upon a railroad pass procured by Carney, and purporting to have been issued on account of the construction company, and their only meal en route was provided by Holler at Carney's suggestion. During the latter part of their journey they were in charge of Randall, who had been directed by Carney to deliver them to McDonald, as agent of the construction company, who was expected to be at Naco to receive them. McDonald was there, having come in from one of the company's camps that day. He endeavored to hasten the proceedings before the board of inquiry in order that he might get the men out to the camp that afternoon, and also provided a meal for them while the proceedings \n\n[232 U.S. 647, 660]\n\u00a0\n were in progress. This was the first party of Mexicans that Carney had attempted to bring into the country at Naco. Others had been brought in at Nogales. According to his statement, the inspection officers at the latter place had been particularly liberal in admitting Mexican laborers procured for the construction company; and he suggested to the inspectors at Naco that like action on their part would be appreciated, but the suggestion did not find favor with them.\n There were some direct contradictions in the evidence, different portions gave rise to opposing inferences, and parts of it were more or less improbable; but as it was the province of the jury to pass on such matters, which it did by the verdict, they require no other notice than they will receive presently.\n As several of the alleged errors, not involving anything fundamental or jurisdictional, were not presented to the appellate court for consideration, they must be regarded as waived, and will be passed without further notice. Montana R. Co. v. Warren, \n137 \nU.S. 348, 351\n, 34 S. L. ed. 681, 682, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 96; Gila Valley, G. & N. R. Co. v. Hall, \n232 \nU.S. 94, 98\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229.\n It is complained that the trial court permitted the government to read in evidence the depositions of absent witnesses, instructed the jury to return a verdict for the government if the evidence reasonably preponderated in its favor, and in other ways treated the case as civil in substance as well as in form. But the trial court was right. An action such as this is civil, and is attended with the usual incidents of a civil action. United States v. Regan, \n232 U.S. 37\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 213.\n The petition did not allege that the acts charged against the construction company were knowingly done, and it is said that this operated to render the recovery erroneous. No doubt the petition was defective. A right to the penalty arises only where  4 is violated 'by knowingly assisting, encouraging, or soliciting the migration or impor- \n\n[232 U.S. 647, 661]\n\u00a0\n tation' of an alien contract laborer into the United States. Knowledge being an element of what is penalized, it must be included in the statement of a cause of action for the penalty. But there are reasons why the defect did not render the recovery erroneous. The defect was not pointed out in the trial court. On the contrary, the case was tried as if the omitted allegation were in the petition. Both parties introduced evidence bearing upon the company's knowledge, both presented requests for instructions treating it as an essential factor in the case, and the jury was instructed upon that theory. In its charge the court said that before any verdict could be returned for the government it must appear from the evidence that some representative of the defendant company, for whose act it would be responsible, 'knowingly assisted, or knowingly encouraged, or knowingly solicited, or knowingly caused others to assist or encourage or solicit, the migration or importation of an alien Mexican contract laborer into the United States.' And again: 'Where knowledge is an essential ingredient of a cause of action, the existence of the knowledge becomes a question to be determined by the jury upon a consideration of all the facts and circumstances in the case.' It is therefore quite plain that the jury found from the evidence that the acts charged against the defendant were knowingly done, and the petition may well be treated as amended to conform to the facts. Ariz. Rev. Stat. 1901,  1288, 1293; Reynolds v. Stockton, \n140 \nU.S. 254, 266\n, 35 S. L. ed. 464, 468, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 773. The defendant was in no wise prejudiced by the defect, and to make it a ground for reversing the judgment, notwithstanding the theory upon which the trial proceeded, would be most unreasonable. San Juan Light & Transit Co. v. Requena, \n224 \nU.S. 89, 96\n, 56 S. L. ed. 680, 683, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 399; Campbell v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 99, 106\n, 56 S. L. ed. 684, 686, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 398.\n Complaint is made of the denial of a motion to suppress certain depositions, subsequently read in evidence, which the government had taken under a commission issued by \n\n[232 U.S. 647, 662]\n\u00a0\n the clerk. The only ground for the motion to which our attention is invited is that the preliminary notice described the case as pending in the second district when it was pending in the first. The case had been brought in the former, and was transferred to the latter at the defendant's instance. The notice and accompanying interrogatories were prepared before and served after the transfer. The purpose of the notice was to inform defendant's counsel of the intended application for a commission, and of the proposed interrogatories, and to give opportunity for filing cross interrogatories. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. 1901,  2507, 2513. No cross interrogatories were filed in either district, and after the expiration of the time allowed for them the clerk of the district in which the case was pending issued the commission. Counsel for the defendant could not have been misled or confused by the error in the notice, for they were fully informed of the transfer, having perfected it the day before the notice was served. In these circumstances the trial court, as also the supreme court of the territory, held that the error was inconsequential and did not require the suppression of the depositions. We perceive no reason for disturbing that conclusion. On the contrary, we think it was plainly correct.\n Over the defendant's objection, the decision of the board of special inquiry was admitted in evidence as tending to prove that the forty-five men were aliens, and it is said that this was error because the defendant was not a party to the proceeding. One of the questions committed by law to the board for decision, subject to an appeal to the Secretary of Commerce, was whether the men were aliens. The document admitted in evidence disclosed that, after a hearing, the board determined that question in the affirmative, and that the men acquiesced by waiving their right to an appeal. In that way their status as aliens was conclusively established as between themselves and the United States. It is true that the defendant was not a \n\n[232 U.S. 647, 663]\n\u00a0\n party to that proceeding, and that, as a general rule, a judgment binds only the parties and their privies. But it is equally true that a judgment in a prior action is admissible, even against a stranger, as prima facie, but not conclusive, proof of a fact which may be shown by evidence of general reputation, such as custom, pedigree, race, death, and the like, and this because the judgment is usually more persuasive than mere evidence of reputation. 1 Starkie, Ev. 386; 1 Greenl. Ev.  139, 526, 555; Patterson v. Gaines, 6 How. 550, 599, 12 L. ed. 553, 573; Pile v. McBratney, 15 Ill. 314, 319; McCollum v. Fitzsimons, 1 Rich. L. 252. In principle, alienage is within the latter rule, and so the board's decision was properly admitted in evidence for the purpose stated.\n Considerable evidence was admitted, over the defendant's objection, of the acts and declarations of Carney and his assistants while they were procuring laborers in Mexico and bringing them into the United States, and it is contended that this was violative of the rule that the acts and declarations of a professed agent are not admissible to prove the existence or extent of his agency. See United States v. Boyd, 5 How. 29, 50, 12 L. ed. 36, 45. But the contention rests upon a misconception of what the record discloses. This evidence was not admitted to establish the agency or its extent, but to show that the laborers came into the United States in circumstances which rendered their migration or importation unlawful. Whether the defendant was responsible for what was done was another question. The trial court recognized this, and expressly ruled that the agency must be otherwise shown, and we agree with the territorial courts in thinking there was other evidence tending to prove the agency, and that it embraced what was done.\n The evidence disclosed that when the arrangement was made with Carney, and on one or two occasions thereafter, he was in terms instructed not to engage any laborer \n\n[232 U.S. 647, 664]\n\u00a0\n in Mexico, and not to induce or assist any laborer to migrate thence into the United States, and because of this it is said that the evidence afforded no basis for holding the defendant responsible for the acts of Carney and his assistants in inducing and aiding the migration or importation of the laborers named in the petition. In dealing with this point the courts below held that under the evidence as a whole, it was an admissible conclusion that the instructions to Carney were not given in good faith, or were in effect abrogated by acquiescence in their nonobservance. An examination of the evidence as set forth in the record satisfies us that it afforded reasonable support for either of these conclusions, and therefore that the question was properly one for the jury. And upon looking at the court's charge as incorporated into the record we find that the matter was fairly and adequately submitted.\n Although conceding that there was evidence that ten of the men were citizens of Mexico, the company claims that there was no evidence of the alienage of the other thirty-five. It must be held otherwise. Not only did the decision of the board of inquiry constitute such evidence, but it was destinctly testified by some of the men, who became witnesses at the trial, that 'they were all Mexicans,' meaning thereby, as the context shows, that they were all citizens of Mexico.\n Still another contention is that, as all the men named in the petition were brought into the United States at one time, there was but a single violation of the statute, and only one penalty could be recovered. The statute declares that 'separate suits may be brought for each alien thus promised labor or service,' and this plainly means that a separate penalty shall be assessed in respect of each alien whose migration or importation is knowingly assisted, encouraged, or solicited in contravention of the statute. See Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. United States, \n231 U.S. 112\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 26. \n\n[232 U.S. 647, 665]\n\u00a0\n The action of the court in rendering judgment against the defendant for the costs is challenged, but this was so clearly right as to render discussion of it unnecessary. Ariz. Rev. Stat. 1901,  1543, 2639; Kittredge v. Race, \n92 \nU.S. 116, 121\n, 23 S. L. ed. 488, 490; United States v. Verdier, \n164 \nU.S. 213, 219\n, 41 S. L. ed. 407, 409, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 42.\n As we find no prejudicial error in the record, the judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","80":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREAT NORTHERN R. CO. v. O'CONNOR(1914)\nNo. 473\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 508, 509]\n\u00a0\n The Boyd Transfer Company of Minneapolis in addition to its regular transfer business acted as a forwarder by railroad. By collecting from different shippers small lots of goods sufficient in the aggregate to fill a car, it secured carload rates, and out of the difference between carload and less than carload rates it made a profit and at the same time was enabled to offer better rates to the small shipper. How this difference between the two rates was divided between owner and forwarder does not appear in the record. At the time of the shipment referred to in this case, the railroad company had four rates on household goods (including emigrant movables), which vary, both according to the weight and value of the shipment, as follows:\n Less than carload lots (value not stated) $3.00 per cwt. Less than carload lots (not to exceed $10 per cwt.) 2.00 \" \" Carload lots (value not stated) 1.60 \" \" Carload lots (value not to exceed $10) 1.00 \" \"\n\n While these tariffs were in force, the Boyd Transfer Company was employed by the plaintiff, on terms not stated, to box, transfer, and ship certain property which she desired to have sent to Portland, Oregon. The articles consisted of a typewriter, stationery, books, curtains, wearing apparel, jewelry, and other personal effects. Some of them had been packed in a trunk, and the balance were boxed by the Boyd Company and loaded by it into a car filled with household goods. The weight of the load was 22, 000 lbs. The Boyd Company filled out a bill of lading, describing the shipment as 'One car of Emigrant Mov- \n\n[232 U.S. 508, 510]\n\u00a0\n able.' 'Released to $10 per cwt.,' and naming 'Boyd Transfer & Storage Company, shipper.' The bill of lading on presentation was signed by the agent of the railroad company. The goods were lost en route and the plaintiff brought suit against the railroad company for $598.65, their full value. The company filed a plea setting up that the property had been destroyed without its fault, and further contended that in view of the provisions of the tariff, and the fact that the goods had been shipped on the $1 rate, the carrier could not be held liable beyond $10 per hundredweight.\n At the trial the plaintiff testified she did not know that there had been any valuation of her goods, as the agent of the Boyd Company in soliciting the shipment had stated that it had a through car, but said nothing to her about shipping her effects as household goods, and she understood that they were to be shipped as a separate consignment. She testified that she had stated to the transfer company that her goods were new, and as she had no insurance, she was willing to pay the regular rates.\n The defendant introduced the tariffs, and offered evidence to show that its agents had no knowledge of the contents of plaintiff's boxes which had been loaded into the car by the transfer company, which also made out the bill of lading and indorsed thereon a statement that the car contained 'Emigrant Movables Released at $10 per cwt.'\n A number of auctioneers and dealers in secondhand furniture were introduced as witnesses for the purpose of establishing the average value of secondhand furniture and household goods. They testified that they were familiar with the value of household goods and secondhand furniture; testified that only a few of such effects are sold by weight, but the value being ascertained, the articles could be weighed and the value per pound then \n\n[232 U.S. 508, 511]\n\u00a0\n determined. This they illustrated by giving the cost, weight, and value per pound of various articles, and gave their opinion as to the average value of shipments of household goods, including furniture, carpets, wearing apparel, and the like. One witness stated that the average value was about $4 per cwt., another $5 per cwt., another testified that, including a secondhand piano weighing 1,500 lbs., the average value would be about $7 per cwt. There was no testimony in rebuttal, beyond the fact that the articles belonging to plaintiff were shown to be worth much more than $10 per cwt.\n The court charged that if the Boyd Company was the agent of the plaintiff to make the shipment, she was bound by its valuation, provided such valuation was not an arbitrary attempt to limit liability, and left to the jury to determine whether there had been such an arbitrary attempt to limit liability. They returned a verdict for the amount claimed in the complaint. The defendant moved for a new trial because of errors in the charge and because the verdict was in excess of the sum for which the defendant could be held responsible under the tariffs filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. The judge held that the carrier was not responsible for $62.50, the value of jewelry and silverware in the trunk, and the plaintiff having written off that amount, judgment was rendered against the defendant for $533.40, a sum much in excess of $10 per cwt. The case was then taken to the supreme court of Minnesota, which affirmed the judgment. It held that the railroad company was charged with knowledge that a considerable portion of the amount received by shipping at reduced rates went to the forwarding company, and not to the various owners of the goods packed in one car; and that the railway company must have known that the Boyd Company was ignorant of the value and contents of the boxes belonging to the different shippers. It ruled that the Boyd Company had no implied \n\n[232 U.S. 508, 512]\n\u00a0\n authority to make an agreement as to the value of plaintiff's goods. It further held that where there had been any bona fide attempt to fix value was a question of fact; and as the jury by their verdict had found that there had been no such effort, the plaintiff, under Ostroot v. Northern P. R. 111 Minn. 504, 127 N. W. 177, was entitled to recover the full value of the goods shipped. It further held that the rule announced by it was not opposed to Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 57 L. ed. 314, 44 L. R.A.(N.S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148; Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Miller, \n226 U.S. 513\n, 57 L. ed. 323, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 155; Chicago, St. P. M. & O. R. Co. v. Latta, \n226 U.S. 519\n, 57 L. ed. 328, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 155. The defendant then sued out a writ of error.\n Messrs. E. C. Lindley and M. L. Countryman for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. C. D. O'Brlen, James Mattimore, and T. P. McNamara for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Lamar: \n\n[232 U.S. 508, 513]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff owned personal effects weighing 545 lbs. and worth $598. She employed the Boyd Transfer Company, which was also a forwarder, to box and ship the property from Minneapolis to Portland. The regular freight rate on such a shipment would have been $3 per cwt.; but without express authority from her, the company forwarded her boxes with others under the terms of a tariff which named $1 as the rate on carload shipments of household goods valued at less than $10 per cwt. The car and its contents were destroyed, and the state supreme court held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the full value of her property because (1) the railroad agents must have known that the transfer company was a forwarder, without authority to value plaintiff's property, and because (2) there had been no bona fide effort to agree upon a valuation. \n\n[232 U.S. 508, 514]\n\u00a0\n 1. It is conceded that the carrier had no knowledge of the contents of the boxes which were loaded by the transfer company and forwarded under the low rate applicable to household goods worth less than $10 per cwt. In the absence of something to indicate that the transfer company was guilty of false billing, the carrier was not required to make special inquiry, but could rely on the statement that the car was loaded with goods of the character and value stated. For, although the Boyd Company was a forwarder, engaged in collecting a number of small shipments from various persons in order to fill a car and obtain the lower rates applicable to carload shipments, yet the railroad company was obliged to treat the forwarder as shipper, even though thereby the carrier lost the benefit of the higher rate which would have been applicable to separate and small shipments. This was the ruling in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. \n220 U.S. 235\n, 55 L. ed. 448, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 392, where it was held that the carriers were not concerned with the question of title, but must treat the forwarder as shipper, and charge the rates applicable to the quantity of freight tendered regardless of who owned the separate articles. If the forwarder was shipper for the purpose of securing carload rates, it was also shipper for the purpose of classifying and valuing, in order to determine which tariff rate was applicable.\n\n 2. \nThe plaintiff contended, however, that she had expected her goods to be transported as a separate consignment. But the transfer company had been intrusted with goods to be shipped by railway, and, nothing to the contrary appearing, the carrier had the right to assume that the transfer company could agree upon the terms of the shipment, some of which were embodied in the tariff. The carrier was not bound by her private instructions or limitation on the authority of the transfer company, whether it be treated as agent or forwarder. If there was any undervaluation, wrongful classification, or \n\n[232 U.S. 508, 515]\n\u00a0\n violation of her instructions, resulting in damage, the plaintiff has her remedy against that company.\n\n 3. \nThe plaintiff, however, claimed that, even if the Boyd Transfer Company is to be treated as her agent to agree upon the terms of shipment, there had been no bona fide effort to agree on a valuation, and that she was therefore entitled to recover the full value of her goods. In order to meet this contention the defendant offered evidence to show that it had no knowledge of the contents of the boxes, and was entitled to rely upon the entry on the bill of lading inasmuch as the fair average value of household goods was less than $10 per cwt. Under the decisions in Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, \n227 U.S. 655\n, 57 L. ed. 689, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 391; Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Harriman, \n227 U.S. 657\n, 57 L. ed. 690, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397, it was not necessary to offer evidence to sustain the reasonableness of rates, classification, or other terms in the tariff filed with the Commission. The shipper had the right, by appropriate proceedings, to attack the rate or the classification, and, if either or both were held to be unreasonable, could secure appropriate relief either by reparation order, or by suit in court, after such finding of unreasonableness. But so long as the tariff rate, based on value, remained operative, it was binding upon the shipper and carrier alike, and was to be enforced by the courts in fixing the rights and liabilities of the parties. The tariffs are filed with the Commission and are open to inspection at every station. In view of the multitude of transactions, it is not necessary that there shall be an inquiry as to each article, or a distinct agreement as to the value of each shipment. If no value is stated, the tariff rate applicable to such a state of facts applies. If, on the other hand, there are alternative rates based on value, and the shipper names a value to secure the lower rate, the carrier, in the absence of something to show rebating or false billing, is entitled to collect the rate which applies to goods of that class, and if sued for their loss it is liable only for the loss of \n\n[232 U.S. 508, 516]\n\u00a0\n what the shipper had declared them to be in class and value.\n\n 4. \nNor was the result changed because of the use of printed forms. This appears from the ruling in Hart v. Pennsylvania R. Co. \n112 U.S. 331\n, 28 L. ed. 717, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 151, where it was claimed that the shipper had not been asked to state the value, but had merely signed a printed contract naming a value. The court said: 'The valuation named was the 'agreed valuation,' the one on which the minds of the parties met, however it came to be fixed, and the rate of freight was based on that valuation, and was fixed on condition that such was the valuation, and that the liability should go to that extent and no further.' The rule of the Hart, Carl, and Harriman Cases was not applied in the court below, and the judgment must be reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREEN v. MENOMINEE TRIBE OF INDIANS IN WISCONSIN(1914)\nNo. 285\nArgued: Decided: May 11, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 558, 559]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. L. T. Michener, P. G. Michener, and C. F. Dillett for appellant.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 558, 560]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Thompson for appellees.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 558, 562]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n By this appeal a review is sought of a judgment of the court below holding that an amended petition filed by the appellant stated no cause of action, and dismissing the same. 47 Ct. Cl. 281. Our attention, therefore, must be directed to the petition; but as a means of at once clarifying the issues, we refer to the act of Congress authorizing the suit, and briefly state the averments of an original petition which was likewise dismissed because stating no cause of action.\n By an act of Congress of May 29, 1908 (35 Stat. at L. 444, chap. 216 ,  2), jurisdiction was conferred upon the court of claims 'to hear, determine, and render final judgment, nothwithstanding lapse of time or statute of limitation, for any balances found due, without interest, with the right of appeal, as in other cases,' upon the claims of eight named persons who were described in the act as 'traders,' against the 'Menominee tribe of Indians in Wisconsin, and against certain members of said tribe at the Green Bay Agency, for supplies, goods, wares, merchandise, tools, and live stock furnished certain members of the said tribe after the first day of January, in the year eighteen hundred and eighty, for the purpose of carrying on logging operations upon the Menominee Indian Reservation, in Wisconsin.' The statute further provided: 'Said court shall, in rendering judgment, ascertain and determine the amount, if any, due upon each of said claims, and if the court find that there is a liability upon any of said claims, it shall then determine if such liability be that of the said Menominee tribe of Indians as a tribe, or that of individual members of said tribe, and it shall \n\n[233 U.S. 558, 563]\n\u00a0\n render judgment for the amount, if any, found due from said tribe to any of said claimants, and it shall render judgment, for the amounts, if any, found due from any of the individual members of said tribe to any of said claimants.' The statute then provided the means by which the judgments, if any were rendered, whether against the tribe or against individual Indians, should be paid.\n Green, the appellant, one of the traders named in the act, sought to recover from the Menominee tribe and 158 named members thereof an amount alleged to be the price of certain equipment and supplies alleged to have been furnished by him. The liability of the individual Indians was based upon averments that they had received during the years 1886 to 1889 the amount of the equipment and supplies sued for, and that they had contracted to pay for the same, the supplies having been furnished them to enable them to carry on logging operations on the Menominee Reservation in Wisconsin. The liability of the tribe was based on averments that it had expressly guaranteed that the individual Indians, members of the tribe, would pay for the supplies furnished them for the purposes and under the circumstances alleged. The defendants jointly demurred on two grounds: first, that the act conferring authority to bring suit was repugnant to the Constitution, and second, because the petition stated no cause of action. Holding that Congress had the undoubted power to pass the jurisdictional act, the court overruled the first ground. It also overruled the second ground as to the individual members of the tribe who were made defendants, but it sustained the exception of no cause of action as to the tribe, the court holding that 'under the averments of the petition the Menominee Tribe of Indians is but a naked guarantor for the debt of another, and such promise, not being in writing, is void under the statute of frauds.' The suit, as to the tribe, was therefore dismissed. \n\n[233 U.S. 558, 564]\n\u00a0\n By leave, an amended petition was filed stating a new cause of action and joining the United States as defendant. This petition, after alleging that the petitioner was a citizen of the United States and a resident of Wisconsin, and after counting upon the jurisdictional act, made in substance the following averments: That in 1881 the Menominee Indians on the reservation were in a destitute condition, and, to save them and their families from starvation, the United States granted them permission to cut and sell the dead and down timber on the reservation, '10 per cent of the proceeds to go to the benefit of the said tribe and those performing labor in that respect.' That when it developed that the Indians, because of their extreme poverty and want of credit, could not procure the equipment and supplies which were essential to enable them to make use of the permission, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs sent a special agent, John A. Wright, to the Reservation, to make some arrangement whereby such condition could be remedied. That a council of the tribe was thereupon held, attended by all the chiefs and head men and practically all the members of the tribe, and it was agreed by and between the then Indian trader, M. Wescott, 'as one party to the agreement, and the Menominee Indian Tribe as the other party thereto, that the said M. Wescott, the duly licensed Indian trader, at Keshena, Wisconsin, should furnish necessary equipment and supplies to those members of the tribe who desired to engage in logging operations to enable them to carry on such work, and support their respective families while so engaged, such equipment and supplies not to exceed the sum of $2.50 for each thousand feet of logs so cut and sold; that all logs cut and hauled by the Menominee Tribe in the logging operations were to be sold through the Indian agent, to the highest and best bidder; and that the prices for such supplies as were to be furnished by the petitioner should be such prices as were being paid in cash for similar \n\n[233 U.S. 558, 565]\n\u00a0\n supplies in that part of the state, with transportation added; that said Menominee Tribe promised and agreed that such equipment and supplies so furnished should be paid for out of the first proceeds from the sale of the logs so to be cut and sold. That said agreement was made with the consent and approval of the Indian agent residing at Keshena, Wisconsin, and in charge of said Menominee Indian Reservation, and also by the said special agent, John A. Wright. That said agreement had the unanimous approval of all members of the tribe present at said council. That said agreement was made orally by the said M. Wescott, personally, and by the chiefs and head men on behalf of said tribe. . . .' It was alleged that the agreement thus made was carried out by the tribe and by Wescott, who made advances for the purposes of the operations in cutting the dead and down timber, and continued to do so until the year 1886, when Wescott ceased to be the Indian trader and was succeeded by Green, the petitioner, and one Stacy, whose rights the petitioner Green had acquired. The petition then charged that, as the condition of destitution and inability to obtain equipment and supplies which had led to the making of the agreement with Wescott yet prevailed after petitioner and Stacy became the Indian traders, on the 1st of January, 1887, it was agreed between petitioner and Stacy and the tribe that the previous agreement should be continued in full force and effect with petitioner and Stacy, the petition expressly averring that 'said last-mentioned agreement was made with your petitioner and W. H. Stacy, personally, and on behalf of the Menominee Tribe, by the chiefs and head men thereof, which said chiefs and head men still continued to have and were recognized as having authority to make contracts in behalf of, and binding on, said tribe. That said last- mentioned agreement was approved by the Indian agent at Keshena, Wisconsin, and was acquiesced in by all members of said tribe, and treated by all \n\n[233 U.S. 558, 566]\n\u00a0\n parties interested as valid and binding on the contracting parties.'\n It was averred that up to 1889 supplies were furnished in accordance with the agreement with the approval of the Indian agent and the United States, and with a few exceptions were paid for by the methods pointed out by the contract; that during the year 1889, however, supplies amounting to $ 13,087.46 were furnished to 158 members of the tribe, the name of each member and the amount supplied him being stated, for which payment had not been made either by the Indians, the tribe, or the United States.\n It was further averred that such unpaidfor supplies were furnished 'in accordance with and relying on said agreement,' and that petitioner and Stacy 'did not and would not extend credit to the individual members of said tribe, but extended such credit solely to the tribe, relying upon said agreement.' It was further alleged that the proceeds from the sales of the dead and down timber cut and hauled by the Indians were received by the Indian agent, and if the amounts which came into his hands in accordance with the contract and which were subject by its terms to be applied to the payment of the supplies advanced under the terms of the agreement had been so applied, all the supplies would have been paid for; but that they remain unpaid for because 'such proceeds were not so applied.' After averring that the logging operations and the credits extended by the petitioner and Stacy were for the benefit of the tribe, the petition charged that 'there is a large fund in the possession of the United States to the credit and for the benefit of said Menominee Tribe of Indians, derived through their logging operations, and now amounting to more than a million and a half dollars, which fund has been accumulated through the credit extended and assistance rendered by licensed traders to the Menominee Indians in logging operations,' \n\n[233 U.S. 558, 567]\n\u00a0\n but there was no averment that such sum or any part thereof was derived from payments made to the United States by the Indian agent of any portion of the sum derived from the 10 per cent provided for in the contract, and which it was contemplated would be used by the Indian agent for the purpose of paying the trader for the supplies furnished by him. There was also no averment that the money to the extent of the amount of the supplies which was received by the Indian agent out of the funds of the Indians, and which was not by him applied to pay for the supplies, was ever turned over to the Indians, or that they became in any way the beneficiaries thereof.\n The petition concluded with the following averment and prayer:\n'Your petitioner avers that there is due him from the Menominee Tribe of Indians, or from the individual members thereof, as may be found and adjudicated by the court, the sum of Thirteen Thousand and Eighty seven Dollars, Forty-six Cents ($13,087.46).\n\n'Wherefore the petitioner prays judgment for Thirteen Thousand and Eighty-seven Dollars, Forty-six Cents ($13,087.46).'\n\n By a general demurrer the defendants, besides questioning the right to file the amended petition, on the ground that it constituted an entire departure, and insisting in any event that if there was a right to file it, its averments did not state a cause of action, denied the right to implead the United States as a defendant, and challenged the constitutionality of the jurisdictional act. The court, without specifically directing its attention to the other grounds, came to consider whether the amended petition stated a cause of action, and deciding that it did not, dismissed the cause, and, as we at the outset said, the rightfulness of its action in so doing is the matter we are called upon to decide.\n The contentions pressed upon the one side to sustain the correctness of the conclusion of the court below, and \n\n[233 U.S. 558, 568]\n\u00a0\n on the other, to demonstrate the existence of reversible error, all but involve an examination of the reasoning which led the court to its conclusion, and we think the most direct way to dispose of the case will be to state under separate headings the propositions to which the court gave its sanction, and the reasons relied upon to establish that error was committed.\n\n 1. \nThe court held that the jurisdictional act, except so far as concerned the statute of limitations, created no new right in favor of the petitioner, but simply afforded a means of establishing by a proceeding in the court of claims the existence, if any, of a claim against the tribe and the individual members of the tribe as such. From this premise the conclusion was deduced that the act gave no right to sue the United States, and conferred no jurisdiction upon the court below over claims against an Indian as a mere individual, aside from his membership of the tribe, or dissociated from his dependent condition as an Indian, subject, because of such condition, to the exercise by the United States of governmental supervision and control. The court consequently decided that it was not concerned with any supposed liability of the individual defendants as citizens of the United States, resulting from their purely individual and personal contracts, and which, therefore, were not related to or connected with tribal membership or the dependency resulting from status as an Indian, as distinguished from citizenship. We think the conclusions thus reached by the court are so clearly the necessary result of the text of the act that we content ourselves with referring to that text as a demonstration of their soundness.\n 2 Concluding that the relevant provisions of  2103 of the Revised Statutes (which are in the margin ) were ap-\n Sec. 2103. No agreement shall be made by any person with any tribe of Indians, or individual Indians not citizens of the United States, for the payment or delivery of any money or other thing of value, in present or in prospective, or for the granting or procuring any privilege to him, or any other person, in consideration of services for said Indians relative to their lands, or to any claims growing out of, or in reference to, annuities, instalments, or other moneys, claims, demands, or thing, under laws or treaties with the United States, or official acts of any officers thereof, or in any way connected with or due from the United States, unless such contract or agreement be executed and approved as follows:\n First. Such agreement shall be in writing, and a duplicate of it delivered to each party.\n Second. It shall be executed before a judge of a court of record, and bear the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs indorsed upon it.\n ... * *\n All contract or agreements made in violation of this section shall be null and void, . . . \n\n[233 U.S. 558, 569]\n\u00a0\n plicable and controlling, as the contract alleged was not in writing and did not in other respects conform to the statute, it was held that no right to recover was stated in the petition. Again, we think that the conclusion of the court on this subject is so clearly within the text of the statute that it suffices to direct attention to such text without going further. But if it be conceded for argument's sake that there is ambiguity involved in determining from the text whether the statute is applicable, we are of the opinion that the case as made is so within the spirit of the statute, and so exemplifies the wrong which it was intended to prevent and the evils which it was intended to remedy as to dispel any doubt otherwise engendered. Nothing, we think, could more cogently demonstrate this statement than does the development in the court below concerning the claim in controversy: the uncertainty as to the alleged debtor, manifested by the claim against the individual members of the tribe as principals and against the tribe as a mere surety, shifting, as the exigencies of the case required, to a claim against the tribe as principal, and secondarily against the members as mere \n\n[233 U.S. 558, 570]\n\u00a0\n accessories, culminating in a prayer for relief which, in and of itself, points to the uncertainty with which the transactions referred to were environed. And this is additionally fortified by observing that on the face of the petition it appears that an adequate amount of the labor and property of the tribe or of its individual members passed into the hands of the person designated under the alleged contract, and who, by its terms, was charged with the duty of paying it over for the equipment and supplies furnished. A situation which makes it clear that the controversy is not whether there is a liability express or implied for supplies and equipment received and not paid for, but upon whom the loss must fall resulting from the failure of the person designated under the asserted contract, and who received the money, to discharge his duty by paying it over to the furnisher of the supplies, who was a party to the alleged contract, and in whose interest and for whose benefit presumably the provision as to the retention and paying over of the money was made.\n But it is said that the statute ought not to be held applicable because the petitioner was a licensed Indian trader, authorized to deal with the tribe and its members. But manifestly the right to deal did not confer power to deal by making unlawful contracts. And this consideration also answers the proposition so much insisted upon that because the asserted contract was made in the presence of and with the assent of an agent of the Interior Department, therefore the provisions of  2103 should not be held applicable. We say the prior reasoning is controlling, since it cannot be held that the presence of the agent of the Interior Department authorized the doing of that which was expressly prohibited by law. In other words, that an unlawful contract became lawful because of the presence, at its making, of a public officer whose obvious duty it was to see to it that the law was not violated. Indeed, when the prohibitions of  2103 are considered and the \n\n[233 U.S. 558, 571]\n\u00a0\n presence of the representative of the Interior Department at the time the alleged agreement was entered into is borne in mind, if inferences are to be indulged in it is not to be inferred that that which was prohibited by law was done, but rather the assumption should be that instead of leaving the trader who was to furnish the equipment and supplies for utilizing, by the Indians, the dead and down timber, to depend for his payment upon the mere force of the contract agreements of the tribe or its individual members, having regard to the interest of the trader and his protection, and with his consent, it was arranged that the proceeds to arise from marketing the dead and down timber should go into the hands of the Indian agent, so that, before paying the Indians for their labor, the sum due for the supplies should be paid by the agent to the trader, thus in a sense impounding in the hands of the person selected by him the proceeds for the trader's benefit. And this view answers the contention made that, even in the absence of an express contract, there should have been a judgment against the tribe and its members upon the theory of an implied obligation to pay, arising from the fact of the receipt by the tribe or its members of supplies or equipment for which they had not paid. True, in a narrow sense it may be said that the case involves the right of the petitioner to be paid for the supplies furnished, but, from the point of view of the Indians in a broad sense the case as made involves deciding whether the petitioner should bear the loss of the failure of the agent to pay over to him out of the moneys retained for that purpose, the sum of the advances of supplies; that is to say, whether the Indians, after having placed in the hands of the designated person the sum of the supplies, are under the obligation to pay again,-that is, to pay twice.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","82":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHAMMOND PACKING CO. v.

The answer, with some allegations not now material, admitted the facts and set up that  4064 of the Political Code of Montana, as amended, by which the tax was imposed, violates the 14th Amendment. That is the only question raised here, so that other incidental or preliminary matters need not be mentioned. Judgment was entered for the state on the pleadings and the judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state.\n The argument for the plaintiff in error is that, the tax being pronounced or assumed by the state courts to be a tax for revenue, it is unjustifiable to put oleomargarin in a class by itself and to discriminate, for instance, between it and butted. But we see no obstacle to doing so in the Constitution of the United States. Apart from interference with commerce among the states, a state may restrict the manufacture of oleomargarin in a way in which it does not hamper that of butter. Capital City Dairy Co. v.

These lines existed and were operated by the company; some, it may be, before the territory of Oklahoma was organized, and most, if not all, before Oklahoma was endowed with statehood. The lines composing the system originated in various charters, some enacted by Congress, accompanied with grant of land, and others by territorial grant. The unified system resulted from foreclosures, consolidations, etc. In 1908 the company was sued by a citizen and resident of Oklahoma, in a court of that state. On the ground of diversity of citizenship a petition and bond in due form and seasonable time were filed by the company for removal to the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Oklahoma. What action was taken by the state court does not appear, but presumably the petition was denied,-the following document having been issued by the secretary of state: \n\n[232 U.S. 318, 320]\n\u00a0\n State of Oklahoma.\n Revocation of Charter of St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Company in Oklahoma.\n Guthrie, Oklahoma, August 29th, 1908\n\n\n In the District Court.\n Gertrude Goode, Administratrix of the Estate of Frank R.

T. Johnson, judge of the district court of Comanche county, that the above-named corporation defendant, St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Company, has filed a petition for removal to the United States court, a certified copy of which is on record in the office of the secretary of state at the Capitol in the city of Guthrie, in the state of Oklahoma.\n Therefore, I, Leo Meyer, assistant secretary of state and now acting secretary of state of the state of Oklahoma, by authority invested in me under  4 of house bill No. 131, approved by the governor of the state of Oklahoma, C. N. Haskell, May 26th, 1908, do hereby declare the license of the said St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Company to transact business in the state of Oklahoma forfeited and revoked.\n In testimony whereof, I have set my hand and caused to be affixed the great seal of the state.\n Done at the city of Guthrie this 29th day of August, A. D., 1908.\n [Seal.]\n Leo Meyer,\n Acting Secretary of State. \n\n[232 U.S. 318, 321]\n\u00a0\n Thereupon the suit which is now before us was commenced by the railroad company against the secretary of state and his assistant, seeking to enjoin them from giving effect to the certificate, or in any way disturbing or interfering with the company in carrying on business in the state. With much amplitude of statement the source and history of the title of the various railroads forming part of the complainant's system in Oklahoma were enumerated. In addition to asserting that rights secured to the corporation by the state Constitution had been denied by the action complained of, violations of the Constitution of the United States were specifically asserted on the following grounds: First, because the state law under which the secretary of state had purported to act, and the action taken thereunder, constituted an unwarranted interference on the part of the state and its officers with the judicial power of the United States; second, because the attempt to exclude the company from the state, and prevent it from doing business therein, under the circumstances stated, was repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution, the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, and the contract clause, the latter being based on the assertion that the congressional and legislative acts by which the roads forming part of the system of the company had been incorporated constituted contracts giving a right to do business in Oklahoma which that state had no power to impair. The court allowed a restraining order. The bill was demurred to on the ground of want of jurisdiction and want of equity. The demurrer was overruled. The court, in an elaborate opinion, expounded its reasons for so doing, holding that it had jurisdiction because of diversity of citizenship, the complainant being a citizen of Missouri, and the defendants, citizens and residents of Oklahoma. In reaching this conclusion, the court analyzed the various transactions, foreclosure, and consolidations, etc., by which the railroad company had acquired the lines \n\n[232 U.S. 318, 322]\n\u00a0\n composing its system, and held that there was nothing in any of them which destroyed the Missouri citizenship of the complainant. It moreover held in any event there was ample ground for jurisdiction because of the constitutional rights asserted.\n As to the alleged want of equity in the bill, the court, after stating that the obvious purpose of the legislation under which the secretary of state had acted as deduced from its text, was to prevent the removal of causes from the state to a court of the United States, declared that the defendant in argument had so conceded. It was decided that the state was without authority to legislate to that effect, and therefore the law in question and the action of the secretary of state taken under it were void because of repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States. The answer, which was then filed, admitted the incorporation of the complainant in Missouri, and the citizenship in Oklahoma of the defendants, as well as the jurisdictional amount. The allegations of the complaint as to interference with the authority of the courts of the United States as to the commerce and contract clauses of the Constitution and the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment were sought to be traversed by copious averments concerning the subject. Finally it was asserted, 1, that the Missouri corporation was never authorized to acquire any railroad in either the Indian or Oklahoma territory, and it therefore had no standing to assert as a Missouri corporation, its ownership and control of such roads as a basis for removal; 2, that in forming the line or lines of railway which constituted its system, the complainant had consolidated parallel and competing roads, in violation of the anti-trust laws of the territory and of the state of Oklahoma, as well as the law of the United States, and therefore the corporation was not in a position to assert its Missouri citizenship; and 3, that the acquisition by the complainant of various \n\n[232 U.S. 318, 323]\n\u00a0\n roads forming parts of its system, which were covered by charters granted by Congress or by Oklahoma territory, was in conflict with such charters, and for this reason, moreover, the corporation could not be heard to assert its Missouri citizenship. An exception of the complainant to the relevancy of the three grounds just stated was maintained, and they were stricken from the answer. By agreement between the parties, the present appellant, the successor in office as secretary of state, was substituted as defendant. Thereupon, the case having been submitted to the court on bill and answer, a decree was entered perpetually enjoining the secretary of state from giving effect to the order of revocation, or interfering with or disturbing the complainant in the transaction of its business in the state. It was expressly decreed that the act of the legislature of Oklahoma upon which the action of the secretary of state was taken was void and unenforceable because of its repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States. This appeal was then taken.\n Mr. Charles West, Attorney General of Oklahoma, for appellant.\n\n\n[232 U.S. 318, 325]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. F. Evans and E. T. Miller for appellee.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice White\n\n\n[232 U.S. 318, 327]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n We have stated the case only to the extent necessary to make clear the questions essential to be decided.\n The assignments of error in general terms assail the overruling of the demurrer, the striking of matter from the answer, and the final decree. The propositions, however, which are urged at bar to sustain these general assignments, are numerous and we think in some aspects redundant. To consider them in the order in which they are urged would, besides giving rise to repetition, tend to produce confusion. We hence disregard the mere order in which they are stated in the argument, and come to consider the fundamental propositions necessary to be taken \n\n[232 U.S. 318, 328]\n\u00a0\n into view in order to determine whether the court below was right in holding that the law under which the secretary of state acted, as well as the action of that officer, was void because inconsistent with the judicial power of the United States, reserving until that is done such separate consideration of the propositions relied on as we may deem it necessary to make.\n It may not be doubted that the judicial power of the United States as created by the Constitution and provided for by Congress pursuant to its constitutional authority is a power wholly independent of state action, and which therefore the several states may not by any exertion of authority in any form, directly or indirectly, destroy, abridge, limit, or render inefficacious. The doctrine is so elementary as to require no citation of authority to sustain it. Indeed, it stands out so plainly as one of the essential and fundamental conceptions upon which our constitutional system rests, and the lines which define it are so broad and so obvious, that, unlike some of the other powers delegated by the Constitution, where the lines of distinction are less clearly defined, the attempts to transgress or foreget them have been so infrequent transgress or forget them have been so infrequent their statement and application. However, though infrequent, occasions have not ben wanting, especially on the subject of the removal of causes with which we are now dealing, where the general principle has been expounded and applied so as to cause the subject, even from the mere point of view of authority, to be beyond the domain of all possible controversy.\n See for general question, Ex parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123\n, 52 L. ed. 714, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 28 Sup.

Co. \n218 U.S. 135\n, 54 L. ed. 970, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 633.\n With this general principle in hand let us come to fix one or more of the essentials of the right to remove as a prelude to testing the assailed statute and the action taken under it. In the first place, the right, unrestrained and unpenalized by state action, on compliance with the forms required by the law of the United States, to ask the removal of a cause pending in a state to a United States court, is obviously of the very essence of the right to remove conferred by the law of the United States. In the second place, as the right given to remove by the United States law is paramount, it results that it is also of the essence of the right to remove, that when an issue of whether a prayer for removal was rightfully asked arises, a Federal question results which is determinable by the courts of the United States free from limitation or interference arising from an exertion of state power. In the third place, as the right freely exists to seek removal unchecked or unburdened by state authority, and the duty to determine the adequacy of a prayed removal is a Federal, and not a state, question, it follows that the states are, in the nature of things, without authority to penalize or punish one who has sought to avail himself of the Federal right of removal on the ground that the removal asked was unauthorized or illegal. Let us come, then, to the text of the statute, with the object of determining its constitutionality. Its 1st section provides 'that the domicil of every person, firm, or corporation conducting a business in person, by agent, through an office, or otherwise transacting business within the state of Oklahoma, and which has complied with or may comply with the Constitution and laws of the state of Oklahoma, shall be for all purposes deemed and held to be the state of Oklahoma.' The 2d section provides for the immediate revocation of 'the license or charter to do business within the state of \n\n[232 U.S. 318, 330]\n\u00a0\n Oklahoma of every person, firm, or corporation conducting a business in person, by agent, through an office, or otherwise transacting business within said state of Oklahoma, who shall claim or declare in writing before any court of law or equity within said state of Oklahoma, domicil within another state or foreign country.' [Okla. Laws of May 26, 1908.] The 3d section makes it the duty of the judge of any court before which any claim of foreign domicil is made within the contemplation of the 2d section to at once make report of the fact to the secretary of state, and to transmit to that officer a copy of the claim; and the 4th section imposes on the secretary of state the duty immediately, on the receipt of such report and copy of the declaration, to 'declare the license or charter of any person, firm, or corporation so filing said claim or declaration forfeited and revoked;' and the 5th causes it to be a misdemeanor subjecting to a penalty of not less than one thousand nor more than five thousand dollars each day or part of day, for any person whose license or charter is revoked, to do business in Oklahoma in conflict with the prohibitions of the statute.\n While the provisions of the statute are dependent one upon the other, and are unified in the sense that they all are components of a common purpose, that is, tend to the realization of one and the same legislative intent, its provisions, nevertheless, for the purpose of analysis, are plainly twofold in character; that is, one, the compulsory citizenship and domicil within the state which the 1st section imposes, and the other, the prohibition which the statute pronounces against any assertion in a court of the existence of any other citizenship and domicil than that which the statute ordains, and the means and penalties provided for sanctioning such prohibition. Although theoretically, the first would seem to be the more primary and fundamental of the two, since the second, after all, consists but of methods provided for making the first \n\n[232 U.S. 318, 331]\n\u00a0\n operative, the second, from the point of view we are examining, is the primal consideration, since it directly deals with the assertion in a state court of a right to remove, and provides the mechanism which was deemed to be effectual to render the assertion of such right impossible. In other words, the difference between its two provisions is that which exists between an attempt on the one hand to render the enjoyment of a Federal right impossible by arbitrarily creating a fictitious legal status incompatible with the existence of the right, and on the other hand the formulation of such prohibitions and the establishment of such penalties against the attempt to avail of the Federal right as to cause it to be impossible to assert it. Coming, then, to consider the statute from the second or latter point of view, we think it is clear that it plainly and obviously forbids a resort to the Federal courts on the ground of diversity of citizenship in the contingency contemplated, punishes by extraordinary penalties any assertion of a right to remove unde the laws of the United States, and attempts to divest the Federal courts of their power to determine, if issue arises on the subject, whether there is a right to remove. Indeed, the statute goes much further, since, when an application to remove is made, in order to prevent a judicial consideration of its merits even by the state court, it in effect commands the judge of such court, on the making of the application, to refuse the same, and to certify the fact that it was made to a state executive officer to the end that such officer should, without judicial action, strip the petitioning corporation of its right to do business, besides subjecting it to penalties of the most destructive character as a means of compelling acquiescence. When the nature of the statute is thus properly appreciated, nothing need be further side to manifest its obvious repugnancy to the Constitution, or to demonstrate the correctness of the decree of the court below.\n The conclusion just stated leaves us only the duty of \n\n[232 U.S. 318, 332]\n\u00a0\n separately and briefly referring to some of the propositions pressed in argument: (a) the contention that because the object of the suit was to enjoin state officers from violating the constitutional rights of the complainant, it was therefore a suit against the state, and not maintainable, is so plainly in conflict with the settled doctrine to the contrary that we do not further notice it. (b) The contention so much insisted upon, that the act should not be declared unconstitutional because it does not discriminate, we assume refers to the provision of the statute creating an arbitrary standard of state citizenship and domicil; but, as we see no possibility of separating that provision from the unconstitutional attempt to prevent access to the courts of the United States, there is no occasion to further deal with the subject of discrimination. If, however, we were to separately consider it, at once it is to be observed that the contention proceeds upon a self-evident misconception, which is this: that if only wrong be indiscriminately done, it becomes rightful. (c) The proposition that the constitutionality of the statute and the action taken under it is supported by the decisions in Doyle v. Continental Ins. Co. \n94 U.S. 535\n, 24 L. ed. 148, and Security Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Prewitt, \n202 U.S. 248\n, 50 L. ed. 1014, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 619, 6 Ann. Cas. 317, is, we think plainly unfounded. Those cases involved state legislation as to a subject over which there was complete state authority; that is, the exclusion from the state of a corporation which was so organized that it had no authority to do anything but a purely intrastate business, and the decisions rested upon the want of power to deprive a state of its right to deal with a subject which was in its complete control, even though an unlawful motive might have impelled the state to exert its lawful power. But that the application of those cases to a situation where complete power in a state over the subject dealt with does not exist has since been so repeatedly passed upon as to cause the question not to be open. Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas \n\n[232 U.S. 318, 333]\n\u00a0\n \n216 U.S. 1\n, 54 L. ed. 355, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190; Pullman Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 56\n, 54 L. ed. 378, 30 Sup. Ct.

Vickers, \n226 U.S. 205\n, 57 L. ed. 189, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 41; and Herndon v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. \n218 U.S. 135\n, 54 L. ed. 970, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 633. The grounds of the decision in the last case show the extremely narrow scope of the rulings in the Doyle and Prewitt Cases, and render their inapplicability to this case certain. Indeed, the ruling in the Herndon Case and in those subsequent to the Doyle and Prewitt Cases, most of which were reviewed in the Herndon Case, demonstrates that no authority is afforded by those two cases for the conception that it is within the power of a state in any form, directly or indirectly, to destroy or deprive of a right conferred by the Constitution and laws of the United States. (d) The matters which the court below ordered stricken from the answer were irrelevant to the issue for decision, even if it be conceded hypothetically that they had merit; because, under that assumption, they would have only been properly cognizable if presented in an appropriate manner and at the proper time to the Federal tribunal which had a right to pass upon them when considering the propriety of the removal which was prayed.\n\n\n (e)\n We consider that the plain text of the statute, the meaning affixed to it by the state court when the application to remove was made, the subsequent action taken by the state officers, the character of the pleadings, the concession as stated by the court below, which was made in the argument, all leave no room for the contention that, at all events, the statute should be construed not as an attempt on the part of the state to prevent the removal of causes, but simply as an effort on the part of the state to exert reasonable control over corporations within its borders. The argument that the statute, if understood as we understand it, is so flagrantly repugnant to the Constitution as to suggest the impossibility of believing that it was enacted with that end in view, but repudiates, as we have seen, the action of the state court and of the \n\n[232 U.S. 318, 334]\n\u00a0\n state officers under it, and the whole course of the trial, and comes at last to the contention that the more plainly an enactment violates the Constitution, the more urgent the duty of deciding that it does not do so. does not do so.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","84":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHAWLEY v. CITY OF MALDEN(1914)\nNo. 18\nArgued: Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Courtenay Crocker and Nathan Matthews for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. L. Boutwell for defendant in error.\n\n\n[232 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error, a resident of the city of Malden, brought this action to recover the amount of certain taxes which he had paid under protest. The taxes were assessed upon shares which he held in foreign corporations most of which did no business and had no property within the state of Massachusetts. It was alleged that the levy and collection were in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment. Demurrer to the declaration was sustained by the superior court, and the case was reported to the supreme judicial court of the commonwealth, which directed judgment for the defendant. 204 Mass. 138, 90 N. E. 415.\n It is conceded that the objection that the statute authorizing the tax (Rev. Laws [Mass.] chap. 12.  2, 4, 23) denies to the plaintiff in error the equal protection of the \n\n[232 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n laws is not well taken; but it is contended that the shares were not within the jurisdiction of the state, and hence that the enforcement of the tax constitutes an unconstitutional deprivation of property.\n The power thus challenged, as the state court points out, has been continuously exercised by the state of Massachusetts for more than three quarters of a century. Substantially the same statutory provision, derived from an earlier enactment, is found in Rev. Stat. (Mass.) chap. 7,  4, and its constitutionality has been sustained by repeated state decisions.

It is well settled that the property of the shareholders in their respective shares is distinct from the corporate property, franchises and capital stock, and may be separately taxed (Van Allen v. Assessors [Churchill v. Utica] 3 Wall. 573, 584, 18 L. ed. 229, 234; Farrington v. Tennessee, \n95 \nU.S. 679, 687\n, 24 S. L. ed. 558, 560; Tennessee v.

Rep. 198); and the rulings in the state cases which we have \n\n[232 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n cited proceed upon the view that shares are personal property, and, having no situs elsewhere, are taxable by the state of the owner's domicil whether the corporations be foreign or do mestic.\n It is said that the question of the constitutional validity of such taxation has not hitherto been raised definitely in this court and has not been directly passed upon. There is no doubt, however, that the existence of the state authority has invariably been assumed. In Sturges v. Carter, \n114 U.S. 511\n, 29 L. ed. 240, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1014, the action was brought to recover taxes imposed under the law of Ohio upon shares of stock owned by a resident of Ohio in the Western Union Telegraph Company, a New York corporation. The right of the state to tax the shares was not questioned, and as it was found that a statutory exemption which was relied upon in defense did not apply, the recovery of the tax was sustained. Again, in Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 U.S. 730\n, 47 L. ed. 669, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 401, it was not disputed that the state was entitled to tax shares owned by its citizens in foreign corporations. The argument was that the statute in that case created an unconstitutional discrimination, and this point being found to be without merit, the tax was upheld. In Wright v. Louisville & N. R. Co. \n195 U.S. 219\n, 49 L. ed. 167, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 16, the question was whether shares of stock in a railroad corporation of another state, which were owned by a Georgia corporation, were taxable under the Constitution and laws of Georgia. The state's power to tax the shares was not denied, so far as the Constitution of the United States was concerned, but it was contended that this power had not been exercised. The Constitution of Georgia provided that all taxation should 'be uniform upon the same class of subjects, and ad valorem on all property subject to be taxed within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax,' and should be levied and collected under general laws. The general tax act had authorized a tax on all of the taxable property of the state. It was clear that the \n\n[232 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n state had directed shares in foreign corporations to be taxed, provided these could be considered to be 'property subject to be taxed within the territorial limits' of the taxing authority. And such shares, when held by a resident, being deemed to fall within this description, it was decided that the state officer was entitled to collect the tax. 'Putting the case at the lowest,' said the court, 'the above-cited section of the Constitution was adopted in the interest of the state as a tax collector, and authorizes, if it does not require, a tax on the stock.' So, also, in Darnell v. Indiana, \n226 U.S. 390\n, 57 L. ed. 267, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 120, the authority of the state to tax the shares of its citizens in foreign corporations was recognized, the tax being sustained against objections urged under the commerce clause, art. I.,  8, and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.\n To support the contention that this familiar state action, hitherto assumed to be valid, is fundamentally violative of the Federal Constitution, the plaintiff in error invokes the doctrine that a state has no right to tax the property of its citizens when it is permanently located in another jurisdiction. Louisville & J. Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, \n188 U.S. 385\n. 47 L. ed. 513, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 463; Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n198 U.S. 341\n, 49 L. ed. 1077, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 669; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 U.S. 194\n, 50 L. ed. 150, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 36, 4 Ann. Cas. 493. But these decisions did not involve the question of the taxation of intangible personal property (Union refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra, p. 211); nor do they apply to tangible personal property which, although physically outside the state of the owner's domicil, has not acquired an actual situs elsewhere. Southern P. Co. v. Kentucky, \n222 \nU.S. 63, 68\n, 56 S. L. ed. 96, 98, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 13. When we are dealing with the intangible interest of the shareholder, there is manifestly no question of physical situs, so far as this distinct property right is concerned, and the jurisdiction to tax it is not dependent upon the location of the lands and chattels of the corporation. \n\n[232 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n The argument, necessarily, is that shares are to be deemed to be taxable solely in the state of incorporation. It is urged that these rights rest in franchise, and that the principle of the decision in Louisville & J. Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, supra, holding that a ferry franchise granted by Indiana to a Kentucky corporation was not taxable in Kentucky, is applicable to shares of stock. But that case went upon the ground that the franchise was an incorporeal hereditament, and hence had its legal situs in Indiana, id. p. 398. Shares fall within a different category. While the shareholder's rights are those of a member of the corporation entitled to have the corporate enterprise conducted in accordance with its charter, they are still in the nature of contract rights or choses in action. Morawetz, Priv. Corp.  225. As such, in the absence of legislation prescribing a different rule, they are appropriately related to the person of the owner, and, being held by him at his domicil, constitute property with respect to which he is under obligation to contribute to the support of the government whose protection he enjoys. Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, \n100 U.S. 491\n, 25 L. ed. 558; Bonaparte v. Appeal Tax Ct. \n104 U.S. 592\n, 26 L. ed. 845; Covington v. First Nat. Bank, \n198 \nU.S. 100, 111\n, 112 S., 49 L. ed. 963, 968, 969, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 562; Southern P. Co. v. Kentucky, supra; Cooley, Taxn. 3d ed. 26.\n Undoubtedly, the state in which a corporation is organized may provide, in creating it, for the taxation in that state of all its shares, whether owned by residents or nonresidernts. Corry v. Baltimore, \n196 U.S. 466\n, 49 L. ed. 556, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 297. This is by virtue of the authority of the creating state to determine the basis of organization and the liabilities of shareholders. Id, pp. 476, 477; Hannis Distilling Co. v. Baltimore, \n216 \nU.S. 285, 293\n, 294 S., 54 L. ed. 482, 485, 486, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 326. So, by reason of its dominant power to provide for the organization and conduct of national banks, Congress has fixed the places at which alone shares in those institutions may be taxed. Rev. Stat.  5219, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3502. Whether, in the case of corporations \n\n[232 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n organized under state laws, a provisions by the state of incorporation, fixing the situs of shares for the purpose of taxation, by whomever owned, would exclude the taxation of the shares by other states in which their owners reside, is a question which does not arise upon this record and need not be decided. No such provision is here involved, and the present case must be determined by the application of the established principle which has been stated.\n The real ground of complaint in this class of cases is not that the shares are taxed in one place rather than in another, but that they are taxed at all, when presumably the property and franchises of the corporation which give to the shares their value are also taxed. As to this we may repeat what was said in Kidd v. Alabama, supra: 'No doubt it would be a great advantage to the country and to the individual states if principles of taxation could be agreed upon which did not conflict with each other, and a common scheme could be adopted by which taxation of substantially the same property in two jurisdictions could be avoided. But the Constitution of the United States does not go so far.'\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHENRY v. HENKEL(1914)\nNo. 216\nArgued: Decided: November 30, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 219, 220]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John C. Spooner, Paul D. Cravath, John D. Lindsay, and Stuart McNamara for appellant.\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 219, 223]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Davis and Mr. W. C. Herron for appellee.\n\n\n[235 U.S. 219, 224]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar delivered the opinion of the court:\n In the 62d Congress, the House of Representatives (H. R. 429, 504) adopted a resolution authorizing the members of the committee on banking and currency to investigate and make a report as to the financial affairs and activities of national banks, interstate corporations, and groups of financiers as a basis for remedial and other legislative purposes. To that end the committee was authorized to send for persons and papers and to swear witnesses.\n Among those summoned and sworn was the appellant, George G. Henry, who was examined at length as to many matters relating to the formation of syndicates and the flotation of stock. He testified that he was a member of the firm of Salamon & Company, bankers in New York, who were accustomed to form syndicates for the acquisition and sale of blocks of stock and to grant participation therein to trust companies and national banks-their directors and corporate officers also being frequently members of the same syndicate. In reference to one of these transactions he testified that Salamon & Company had agreed to pay $8,215,262 for $22,500,000 preferred and common stock in a California oil company; thereupon Salamon & Company, Lewisohn Brothers, Hallgarten & Company, bankers in New York, together with a fourth banking firm (whose name witness did not disclose) had then formed a syndicate for acquiring and disposing of this \n\n[235 U.S. 219, 225]\n\u00a0\n $22,500,000 of oil stock. He testified how the shares were allotted, and that 12 1\/2 per cent went to the unnamed persons in the banking group; that in the subsequent disposition of the stock a number of shares were required by 15 individuals, some of whom were officers of national banks located in New York, Chicago, and Detroit. Other shares were allotted to those who were officers in trust companies in New York and Chicago. Letters were written offering to allot part of this oil stock to the New York syndicate, but before acceptance of the allotment all of the stock had been sold at a profit of nearly $500,000, a part of which went to the members of the New York syndicate (officers of banks), even though they had not previously accepted the allotment. They thus, in effect, received a present of their share of the profits. He was asked to give the names of those composing the New York syndicate, but claimed to have the right under the Constitution to decline to answer the question, saying also that he 'did not want to disclose the names of the participants in the New York syndicate, although he understood it to be the wish of the subcommittee that he should, for the reason that he would consider it dishonorable to reveal the names of his customers unless compelled to do so.'\n The committee ordered the fact of his refusal to answer to be reported to the House for action-majority and minority reports being made. After discussion, the House of Representatives directed that the facts should be laid before the grand jury of the District of Columbia. That body returned an indictment against Henry, charging him with refusing to answer questions propounded by the committee. Rev. Stat.  101-104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 54, 55. A warrant issued and Henry was arrested in New York, and when taken before the commissioner demanded an examination.\n On the hearing and before the introduction of any testimony, he moved for his discharge on the ground that* \n\n[235 U.S. 219, 226]\n\u00a0\n the commissioner was without jurisdiction, since it appeared on the face of the complaint that petitioner was not charged with any offense against the United States.\n The motion was denied, and, it having been admitted that Henry was the person described in the indictment, the government introduced the bench warrant and a certified copy of the indictment as sufficient proof of probable cause.\n The petitioner then offered in evidence the resolution defining the scope of the inquiry, with a transcript of his testimony before the committee-including the question which he refused to answer and his reasons therefor. Copies of the majority and minority reports to the House were also incorporated in the record. After argument the commissioner ordered Henry to be held in custody until the district judge could issue a warrant for his removal to the District of Columbia under the provisions of Revised Statutes,  1014, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 716.\n Thereupon Henry applied to the district judge for a writ of habeas corpus, and on the hearing introduced all of the testimony that had been submitted to the commissioner, and asked for his discharge on grounds similar to those which had been presented to the committing magistrate.\n After argument the district judge discharged the writ, and an appeal was entered to this court, where petitioner's counsel, renewing the objections made in the district court, insist that the resolution did not authorize an inquiry as to the matter about which Henry refused to testify; that the facts charged do not constitute an offense under the statute; or, if so, that the statute is void. On the authority of Re Chapman, \n166 U.S. 668\n, 41 L. ed. 1158, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 677; Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 U.S. 168\n, 26 L. ed. 377, and other cases they insist that in the trial of contested elections, in cases involving the expulsion of members, or other quasi judicial proceedings, the House or Senate may, like any other \n\n[235 U.S. 219, 227]\n\u00a0\n court, compel material and noncriminatory disclosures. But they argue that, in view of the provisions of the 4th Amendment to the Constitution, neither House can compel a citizen to disclose his private affairs as a basis for legislation,-particularly where, as in the present case, the witness was not contumacious, but had fully and freely answered all material questions; had disclosed the fact that national banks and their officers were often members of the same syndicate, and had only refused to give the names of certain bank officials when the names themselves could not by any possibility be of assistance in shaping legislation. They therefore contend that the papers show on their face that there was no jurisdiction to issue the warrant on which he was held, and that Henry should not be subjected to the hardship of being removed to the District of Columbia to stand trial upon an indictment which affirmatively shows that no crime has been committed.\n The government, on the other hand, insists that Rev. Stat.  104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 55, is constitutional, and that Congress may provide for the punishment of witnesses who, in answer to a question propounded by its authority, fail to make noncriminatory disclosures and furnish information deemed necessary as a basis for legislation.\n These important and far-reaching questions, though elaborately argued, should not be decided on this record, in view of the rule, relied on by the government, that such issues must primarily be determined by the trial court.\n The petitioner, however, relying specially on Greene v. Henkel, \n183 U.S. 261\n, 46 L. ed. 189, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 218; Beavers v. Henkel, \n194 U.S. 73\n, 48 L. ed. 882, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 605; Tinsley v. Treat, \n205 U.S. 20\n, 51 L. ed. 689, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 430, claims that, as this is a removal case, with the special hardships attendant thereon, it is to be distinguished from those in which the foregoing rule has been announced.\n When a person under arrest applies for discharge on \n\n[235 U.S. 219, 228]\n\u00a0\n writ of habeas corpus the issue presented is whether he is unlawfully restrained of his liberty. Rev. Stat.  752, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 592. But there is no unlawful restraint where he is held under a valid order of commitment, so that in strict logic the inquiry might extend to the legal sufficiency of the order. In view, however, of the nature of the writ and of the character of the detention under a warrant, no hard and fast rule has been announced as to how far the court will go in passing upon questions raised in habeas corpus proceedings. In cases which involve a conflict of jurisdiction between state and Federal authorities, or where the treaty rights and obligations of the United States are involved, and in that class of cases pointed out in Ex parte Royall, \n117 U.S. 241\n, 29 L. ed. 868, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 734; Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 21 L. ed. 872; New York v. Eno, \n155 U.S. 89\n, 39 L. ed. 80, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 30; Re Loney, \n134 U.S. 372\n, 33 L. ed. 949, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 584, the court hearing the application will carefully inquire into any matter involving the legality of the detention, and remand or discharge, as the facts may require. But, barring such exceptional cases, the general rule is that, on such applications, the hearing should be confined to the single question of jurisdiction, and even that will not be decided in every case in which it is raised. For otherwise the 'habeas corpus courts could thereby draw to themselves, in the first instance, the control of all prosecutions in state and Federal courts.' To establish a general rule that the courts on habeas corpus, and in advance of trial, should determine every jurisdictional question, would interfere with the administration of the criminal law and afford a means by which, with the existing right of appeal, delay could be secured when the Constitution contemplates that there shall be a speedy trial, both in the interest of the public, and as a right to the defendant.\n The question has been before this court in many cases-some on original application and others on writ of error; in proceedings which began after arrest and before commitment; after commitment and before conviction; after \n\n[235 U.S. 219, 229]\n\u00a0\n conviction and before review. The applications were based on the ground of the insufficiency of the charge, the insufficiency of the evidence, or the unconstitutionality of the statute, state or Federal, on which the charge was based. In some of the cases the applicants have advanced the same arguments that are here pressed, including that of the hardship of being taken to a distant state for trial upon an indictment alleged to be void.\n But in all these instances, and notwithstanding the variety of forms in which the question has been presented, the court, with the exceptions named, has uniformly held that the hearing on habeas corpus is not in the nature of a writ of error, nor is it intended as a substitute for the functions of the trial court. Manifestly, this is true as to disputed questions of fact, and it is equally so as to disputed matters of law, whether they relate to the sufficiency of the indictment or the validity of the statute on which the charge is based. These and all other controverted matters of law and fact are for the determination of the trial court. If the objections are sustained or if the defendant is acquitted, he will be discharged. If they are overruled and he is convicted, he has his right of review (Kaizo v. Henry, \n211 U.S. 148\n, 53 L. ed. 125, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 41). The rule is the same whether he is committed for trial in a court within the district, or held under a warrant of removal to another state. He cannot, in either case, anticipate the regular course of proceeding by alleging a want of jurisdiction, and demanding a ruling thereon in habeas corpus proceedings. Glasgow v. Moyer, \n225 U.S. 420\n, 53 L. ed. 125, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 41; Re Gregory, \n219 U.S. 210\n, 55 L. ed. 184, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 143; Ex parte Simon, \n208 U.S. 144\n, 52 L. ed. 429, 28 Sup. Ct.

Ct. Rep. 144; Ex parte Royall, \n117 U.S. 241\n, 29 L. ed. 868, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 734.\n The last of these decisions is particularly in point, not only because of the applicability of its reasoning to the \n\n[235 U.S. 219, 230]\n\u00a0\n present case, but because of the fact that the writ was there denied, even though the statute, on which the charge was based, was ultimately held to be void. Royall v. Virginia, \n121 U.S. 104\n, 30 L. ed. 883, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 826; \n116 \nU.S. 579, 583\n, 29 S. L. ed. 737, 738, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 510; \n125 U.S. 697\n, 31 L. ed. 855, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1392\n\n\n The cases cited do not, of course, lead to the conclusion that a citizen can be held in custody or removed for trial where there was no provision of the common law or statute making an offense of the acts charged. In such case the committing court would have no jurisdiction, the prisoner would be in custody without warrant of law, and therefore entitled to his discharge. Greene v. Henkel, \n183 U.S. 261\n, 46 L. ed. 189, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 218. But the presumption is in favor of the validity of every act of Congress, and it would not be proper for the committing magistrate to treat as invalid a statutory declaration of what should constitute an offense, except in those rare and extreme cases in which the act was plainly and palpably void.\n Neither the issue nor the basis of the decision is changed when the person held under the warrant applies to a district judge for discharge on writ of habeas corpus. So, likewise, the same issue and the same rule of decision must govern when the case is here on appeal from the order of the habeas corpus tribunal. It follows, therefore, that this court should not on this record pass on the jurisdictional questions presented. They, like all other controverted issues in the case, are for the determination of the courts of the District of Columbia when the defendant is therein put to his trial.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","86":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHERBERT v.

Castle for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 70, 72]\n\u00a0\n No counsel appeared for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action of assumpsit begun on June 30, 1909, in the district court of Honolulu, by garnishment and leaving a copy of the summons at a place which, according to the return, was the defendant's last and usual place of abode, he being absent from the territory. The defendant did not appear and the plaintiff got judgment against the fund on July 2, 1909. No appeal or writ of error was \n\n[233 U.S. 70, 73]\n\u00a0\n taken, but on December 31, 1909, the time for suing out a writ of error not having expired, the defendant appeared specially and moved to quash the service and set aside the judgment on the ground that the record showed that there was not sufficient service upon him to comply with the 14th Amendment and the laws of Hawaii. The motion was accompanied by an affidavit to the effect that the defendant had changed his domicil to Australia before the beginning of this suit, that he had returned and lived for a month in January and February, 1909, at the place where the summons was left, and then had gone back to Australia; and that his last and usual place of abode (before his change of domicil, as we understand it) was at Waikiki. The district court overruled the motion and its judgment was affirmed by the supreme court.\n The argument for the plaintiff in error assumes a wider range than is open upon this motion. The supreme court says that the question whether the evidence was sufficient to support the judgment cannot be raised in this way, and we should follow the decision even of it seemed less obviously reasonable than it does. Montoya v. Gonzales, \n232 \nU.S. 375, 376\n, 58 S. L. ed.--, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 413. Moreover, the only errors assigned here are in holding that the service prescribed by  2114 of the Revised Laws of Hawaii, as construed by the court, and that leaving a copy of the summons as above stated after garnishment of a debt due to the defendant, were sufficient to meet the requirements of the 5th Amendment (the court having assumed that the defendant referred to the 5th when he mentioned the 14th in his motion below).\n The supreme court was of opinion that, if the question was open, leaving a copy of the summons at the place where the defendant last had stopped was leaving it at his last and usual place of abode within  2114. On that point we see no sufficient reason for disturbing the judgment. Phoenix R. Co. v. Landis, \n231 \nU.S. 578, 579\n, 58 S. L. ed.--, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 179. Really the only matter before us that calls for a word is \n\n[233 U.S. 70, 74]\n\u00a0\n the decision that a judgment appropriating property within the jurisdiction to payment of the owner's debt, which would be good if the property itself were the defendant, is not made bad by the short and somewhat illusory notice to the owner. Upon this point the court below relied upon the above  2114 and Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714, 727\n, 24 S. L. ed. 565, 570: 'The law assumes that property is always in the possession of its owner, in person or by agent; and it proceeds upon the theory that its seizure will inform him, not only that it is taken into the custody of the court, but that he must look to any proceedings authorized by law upon such seizure for its condemnation and sale.' It has been said from of old that seizure is notice to the owner. Scott v. Shearman, 2 W. Bl. 977, 979, 11 Eng. Rul. Cas. 17; Mankin v. Chandler, 2 Brock. 125, 127, Fed. Cas. No. 9,030. See Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308, 317, 19 L. ed. 931, 932.\n Summons of the defendant's debtor by garnishment is given like effect in express terms by  2114. 'Such notice [i. e., service on the garnishee] shall be sufficient notice to the defendant to enable the plaintiff to bring his action to trial unless the defendant be an inhabitant of this territory, or has sometime resided therein, and then a like copy shall be served personally upon him, or left at his last and usual place of abode.' This statute was in force, no doubt, before the debt garnisheed was contracted, and gave the defendant notice that he must be ready to be represented in order to save a default if the debt was attached. If he had appeared, nothing shows that proper time would not have been allowed to produce evidence at the trial. The district court has jurisdiction over small debts only. Rev. Laws of Hawaii,  1662. Its proceedings naturally are somewhat summary. It appears that the defendant had knowledge of the action before the time for a writ of error had expired, and when it may be that it still would have been possible to set aside the judgment and to retry the case. He did not adopt the course that \n\n[233 U.S. 70, 75]\n\u00a0\n would have opened effective ground of attack even as the record stood. We cannot discover that he has suffered any injustice-still less that he has been subjected to an unconstitutional wrong.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOBBS v.

The proceedings in the state court were begun and had passed to a judgment in the superior court of New Hampshire, subject to exceptions, before the adjudication of bankruptcy. Afterwards the exceptions were overruled on technical grounds not touching the merits, the trustee in bankruptcy being heard at this stage. The action upon the matter in the courts of the United States will be seen in 95 C. C. A. 84, 169 Fed. 586, 175 Fed. 501, and 106 C. C. A. 519, 184 Fed. 409; a rehearing being denied upon the last decision in 107 C. C. A. 663, 185 Fed. 1006, and an appeal to this court allowed in 112 C. C. A. 325, 191 Fed. 811. The allowance of the appeal was correct. Knapp v. Milwaukee Trust Co. \n216 U.S. 545\n, 54 L. ed. 610, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 412; Greey v. Dockendorff, Dec. 15, 1913 [\n231 U.S. 513\n, 58 L. ed . --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 166].\n The Head & Dowst Company had agreed with the bankrupt to erect a grand stand, clubhouse, and other buildings and structures, for $187,644, and had completed the work, with the exception of shutters on the grand stand that would cost about $1,000 to finish. At this point \n\n[231 U.S. 692, 700]\n\u00a0\n it was told by the bankrupt of the hopeless insolvency of the latter, and was informed that it must look to its lien to support its claim. Thereupon the company stopped work and began its lien suit. When the present attempt was made to reopen the matter, the case was sent to a master, who reported in great detail the facts just summed up, and concluded that the company was entitled to a lien for $45,995.02, exclusive of interest, that being the part of the contract price remaining unpaid, less $1,000 for the shutters, etc., and being also very nearly the same sum that was found due in the state court. The judge of the district court thereupon dismissed the trustee's petition, and his decree was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals. 175 Fed. 501, supra.\n We shall consider such questions only as are sufficient to decide the case, omitting others that would have to be considered before the decree below could be reversed. The trustee argues that the failure to take the proper steps to get exceptions heard by the supreme court of the state on the merits constitutes an equitable ground for going behind the state judgment in order to defeat it by an objection of the most narrowly technical sort. The objection, of course, is that the contract was entire, and that whatever justification there may have been for stopping work, or ground for a quantum meruit, nothing short of complete performance would earn the contract price as such, or establish a lien for the same. It is argued in the same connection that the facts did not justify the company in stopping work, but we shall not go behind the finding of the master in this respect, followed as it has been, or say more than that, as we construe the facts and finding, it was quite right, and that putting on the last touches was waived.\n We are of opinion that the decision was equally right. The case was tried upon its merits and decided in favor of the lien by the state court. The failure to get the \n\n[231 U.S. 692, 701]\n\u00a0\n exceptions considered was due to no fault of the appellee, but solely to the conduct of those then representing the interests of the estate. It is a doubtful suggestion that an equity could be founded upon this. Certainly it is an inadequate ground for the intervention of equity to enforce forfeiture of a claim that could not be defeated, if at all, except by a most technical application of the law, and on the assumption that the state court did not know the law of the state. We shall not speculate upon that point, beyond saying that we see no reason to doubt that the state court was right (Bergfors v. Caron, 190 Mass. 168, 76 N. E. 655, and cases in 27 Cyc. 85, 87, and 20 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, 2d ed. 366-368), as we are satisfied that substantial justice has been done. Some subordinate matters of detail were argued, but they do not seem to us to need mention; the whole strength of the case lay in the matter of which we have disposed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","88":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOLDEN LAND & LIVE STOCK CO. v. INTERSTATE TRADING CO(1914)\nNo. 354\nArgued: Decided: May 4, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edward P. Garnett, Oliver H. Dean, and Charles Blood Smith for plaintiffs in error. \n\n[233 U.S. 536, 537]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leonard S. Ferry, Thomas F. Doran, John S. Dean, and Elijah Robinson for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit was brought by the Holden Land & Live Stock Company and Howard M. Holden in the district \n\n[233 U.S. 536, 538]\n\u00a0\n court of Shawnee county, Kansas, to have certain conveyances which were absolute on their face, and the accompanying contracts, decreed to be mortgages, and for an accounting in order to ascertain the amount of the indebtedness thereby secured. It was also alleged that usury had been exacted by the creditor (the National Bank of Commerce of Kansas City, Missouri), and upon this ground it was prayed that in taking the account the debtor should be charged only with the principal, and that the entire interest should be adjudged to be forefeited under  5197 and 5198 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3493).\n The principal facts and the nature of the litigation are succinctly stated by the supreme court of Kansas, as follows (87 Kan. 221-223, -- L.R. A.(N.S.) --, 123 Pac. 733):\n'On June 6, 1901, the Holden Land & Live Stock Company executed to the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company a mortgage for $90,000, due in five years, upon a tract of land in Shawnee county, containing about 5,603 acres of which it was the record owner. On July 1, 1901, the Holden company executed a note to Howard M. Holden for $82,000 secured by a second mortgage on the same tract. This note and second mortgage, with other security, Holden at once transferred to the National Bank of Commerce of Kansas City, Missouri, to secure his note to that bank for $80, 000, bearing the same date, due in one year, and drawing 8 per cent interest, which was subsequently renewed. Holden had personally purchased a tract of land in Missouri, borrowing a part of the amount necessary for the purpose from the bank. To secure the bank the deed was made to one W. H. Winants. Afterwards it was agreed that he should hold the title as further security for Holden's note to the bank. In May, 1904, Holden caused to be executed to the Inter-State Trading Company deeds covering the tracts in Kansas and Missouri, less parts of the former that had been sold, most of the proceeds having been applied to \n\n[233 U.S. 536, 539]\n\u00a0\n cutting down the encumbrances. On February 13, 1908, Holden and the Holden company brought an action against the bank and the Inter-State Trading Company, alleging in substance that the deeds had been given by way of security for the indebtedness owing to the bank, and asking, if this should be found to have been paid in full, a decree quieting title; otherwise, a decree declaring title to be held under the deeds as security for whatever balance should be found due. The defendants maintained that the deeds were intended as absolute conveyances, and operated as such. The court found, in accordance with the report of the referee before whom the case was tried, that the defendants were precluded, by their course of dealing with the plaintiffs, from claiming the absolute title to the land; that the plaintiffs should be allowed to redeem it by paying the defendants what they had in it, amounting at the time the action was begun to $81,091.93, this including the first mortgage, which the bank had purchased; judgment was rendered that if the plaintiffs should pay this amount (which had been reduced to $65,233.67 by sales of land made during the litigation) within six months, their title should be quieted; that if they failed to make the payment within that time they should be barred of all interest in the land. The defendants appeal on the ground that the court should have denied the plaintiffs any relief whatever. The plaintiffs appeal upon two principal grounds: (1) that in the accounting they should not have been charged with interest on the note given to the bank, because by the exaction of usury all interest thereon had been forfeited; and (2) that the first mortgage should not have been enforced against them otherwise than by a foreclosure and sheriff's sale.'\n\n The supreme court of the state decided in favor of the plaintiffs in error upon the second question. Approving the findings made in the trial court, it was concluded that \n\n[233 U.S. 536, 540]\n\u00a0\n the relations between the parties were in effect those of mortgagor and mortgagee, and that the appropriate remedy was a foreclosure and sale. Accordingly, the judgment was modified so as to provide that the lien upon the Kansas land should be enforced in this manner.\n The court affirmed the judgment in other respects; and because, in fixing the amount to be paid in order to redeem the lands in question, the court did not require the forfeiture of all interest, this writ of error is prosecuted.\n The question at once arises whether, in view of the character of the suit and the basis of the ruling, the judgment is subject to review in this court. The action, it will be observed, was not one brought by the bank to enforce the payment of the indebtedness, thus involving the application of the statutory measure of the bank's legal right. Nor was the debtor availing himself of the exclusive remedy afforded by the statute in cases where usurious interest has actually been paid to a national bank (Barnet v. Muncie Nat. Bank, \n98 U.S. 555\n, 25 L. ed. 212; Stephens v. Monongahela, Nat. Bank, \n111 U.S. 197\n, 28 L. ed. 399, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 336). While the plaintiffs insisted that interest should be forfeited, still they were suitors in equity, seeking to be permitted to redeem the lands which had been conveyed; and the decision was placed distinctly upon the ground that the relief sought should be granted only upon the equitable condition that the plaintiff should be charged with the principal of the debt and legal interest. Upon this point the supreme court of Kansas said (87 Kan. 221, 233, 234):\n'Usury was charged and collected upon the Holden note. By the national banking act the exaction of usury destroys the interest-bearing quality of a debt. The referee decided that the plaintiffs were estopped from claiming the benefit of that provision. Nothing was said about usury until the present action was begun. Whether or not an actual estoppel has arisen, it was proper under the circumstances, in view of the equitable relief sought, \n\n[233 U.S. 536, 541]\n\u00a0\n that the plaintiffs should be charged with the principal and legal interest.\n\n\"When the borrower appears in any capacity in a court of equity, asking affirmative relief against a usurious contract to pay money, such relief will, in the absence of statute providing otherwise, be granted him only upon condition of his doing equity; that is, tendering the money actually due. . . . The rule . . . applies when the relief sought is the reformation or cancelation of a deed or mortgage, or other instrument evidencing or securing a usurious debt, or an injunction against threatened damaging action by the creditor, or in fact, whatever be the character of the relief sought. . . . In case the usurious interest has been reserved, or paid in advance, the amount equitably due is the principal debt less the usurious excess of interest paid. In the absence of statute providing otherwise, if the contract for the usurious interest is still executory, the sum equitably due is the principal debt with legal interest thereon.' 39 Cyc. 1010-1012.'\n\n The judgment thus rests upon an independent or non-Federal ground which was adequate to sustain it. The court applied a familiar equitable principle in defining the basis upon which extraordinary aid would be given. 'A court of equity is not positively bound to interfere in such cases by an active exertion of its powers; but it has a discretion on the subject, and may prescribe the terms of its interference.' Story, Eq. Jur .  301; Fanning v. Dunham, 5 Johns. Ch. 122, 142, 143, 9 Am. Dec. 283; Tiffany v. Boatman's Sav. Inst. 18 Wall. 375, 385, 21 L. ed. 868, 879. It is manifest that the plaintiffs were not proceeding by virtue of any Federal right in seeking to have the conveyances which had been executed in the form of absolute transfers of title declared to be mortgages; and it was competent for the court whose intervention was desired for this purpose, to demand that its conscience be satisfied by the doing of equity on the part of those who asked it. \n\n[233 U.S. 536, 542]\n\u00a0\n The decision involves simply the exercise of the equitable jurisdiction in accordance with the jurisprudence of the state, and the ruling which prescribed the conditions of relief is not reviewable here.\n The writ of error must be dismissed.\n Dismissed.\n\n Mr. Justice Day, dissenting:\n I am unable to agree that this court does not have jurisdiction of this writ of error. In my judgment, if the principle here invoked is applied to a case like the one under consideration, it will result that the state court may determine, without power of review in this court, the ultimate effect and scope of rights secured by a Federal statute.\n It appears from the opinion of the supreme court of Kansas, quoted in the opinion in this case, that a national bank, organized under and subject to the limitations of the Federal statutes in that respect, received usury upon a debt which was secured by a coneyance of title which was upon its face a deed. The plaintiff in error stated in its petition the facts which showed the usurious arrangement with the bank and the charging upon the debt of interest in violation of the statute, and thus distinctly relied upon a Federal statute controlling the right of national banks to take usurious interest. It asked to have the conveyance decreed a mortgage in fact and security for the debt, and that only the amount legally collectible thereon should be held to be due. These allegations brought the case within the provisions of  5197 and 5198 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3493), fixing certain consequences for taking usurious interest by national banks. The state court found that the deed had at all times been intended by the parties to be and was security for the debt, but decreed that it should extend to the balance of the debt, with legal interest. \n\n[233 U.S. 536, 543]\n\u00a0\n By means of this petition a right of Federal origin was specially set up, which, if denied, gave the right to come to this court under a Federal statute which has been in substantially the same form, so far as this writ of error is concerned, since the passage of the judiciary act in 1789 [1 Stat. at L. 73, chap. 20]. This is not controverted in the opinion in this case, but the position is taken that the decision rests upon an independent ground not involving a denial of Federal right, and therefore is not reviewable here.\n I am not unmindful of the rule frequently recognized in the decisions of this court, that if the judgment of the state court rests upon an independent, separate ground of local or general law, broad enough or sufficient in itself to base the decision upon and to control the rights of the parties, this court has no jurisdiction to review the action of the state court. So far as I understand the decisions where such independent ground has been sustained, resulting in a lack of jurisdiction in this court to review a decision of a state court, the judgment has proceeded upon the principle that, irrespective of the Federal right asserted, an independent ground of judgment, not involving the Federal question, has controlled the decision. For example, in a number of cases in this court it has been held that, conceding the Federal right asserted to have been one which might have been maintained, nevertheless, if, upon the general doctrine of laches that right no longer exists, the refusal to enforce it because of laches rests the decision upon a principle of general law, applicable to all rights, Federal or otherwise, and is not of itself a denial of a Federal right. So this court has more than once held that a decision placing the rights of the parties upon the doctrine of res judicata, where the decision did not necessarily involve the denial of a right of a Federal character, places the decision upon a non-Federal ground and is not reviewable here. These are examples of independent grounds of general law, which the state court has the right \n\n[233 U.S. 536, 544]\n\u00a0\n to apply to all asserted rights, and their maintenance does not amount to a denial of special claims of Federal right.\n'But,' said this court in Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Illinois, \n200 \nU.S. 561, 580\n, 50 S. L. ed. 596, 604, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 341, 4 Ann. Cas. 1175, 'it is equally well settled that the failure of the state court to pass on the Federal right or immunity specially set up, of record, is not conclusive, but this court will decide the Federal question if the necessary effect of the judgment is to deny a Federal right or immunity specially set up or claimed, and which, if recognized and enforced, would require a judgment different from one resting upon some ground of local or general law.' Without citing all the cases, the rule substantialy as just stated has been frequently recognized. Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 636, 22 L. ed. 429, 444; Anderson v. Carkins, \n135 U.S. 483\n, 34 L. ed. 272, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 905; Wabash R. Co. v. Pearce, \n192 U.S. 179\n, 48 L. ed. 397, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 231; Terre Haute & I. R. Co. v.

Rep. 407.\n\n Applying these principles here, it seems to me that where a party specially asserts, as it did in this case, the application of the Federal statute, which, in unequivocal terms, provides ( 5198 [U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3493]) that the 'taking, receiving, reserving, or charging a rate of interest greater than is allowed by the preceding section, when knowingly done [which the record discloses was so taken in this case], shall be deemed a forfeiture of the entire interest which the note, bill, or other evidence of debt carries with it, or which has been agreed to be paid thereon,' and the supreme court of the state, holding that, notwithstanding the Federal statute, it has the discretion to condition its relief, allowing redemption only upon the payment of principal and legal interest, it has in effect denied the right asserted under the Federal statute, and the correctness of the decision is reviewable here. This statute has no conditions attached to it, and is upon its face applicable \n\n[233 U.S. 536, 545]\n\u00a0\n wherever a situation arises which comes within its terms. In effect, the state court said this is true; usury has been charged upon this contract, and, because of the statute, the security is not enforceable beyond the face of the debt; but as the giver of the security has been obliged to apply to the equity powers of a state court for the carrying out of the contract, a condition may be attached to the relief to which the party is otherwise entitled, and the state court charged the plaintiff in error with the debt, with legal interest, notwithstanding the Federal statute which declares the interest forfeited upon such facts as are here presented. When the court so decided, in my judgment, it necessarily denied a Federal right, and, whether right or wrong, the denial of that right laid the basis for ultimate decision by this court as to the nature and extent of the rights secured by the Federal statute.\n In my opinion this court should review the judgment and determine for itself whether the rule invoked in the state court has this effect upon a Federal statute, which unconditionally forfeits the entire interest where usurious interest has been knowingly reserved or taken.\n I therefore dissent from the opinion of the court holding that there is no jurisdiction of the case.\n Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice Van Devanter concur in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","89":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOLLERBACH v. U S(1914)\nNo. 250\nArgued: Decided: April 6, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. William B. King, George A. King, and William E. Harvey for appellant. \n\n[233 U.S. 165, 166]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Thompson for appellee.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 165, 167]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit was brought to recover upon a contract between the appellants, doing business as Hollerbach & May, and the United States, for the repair of Dam No. 1, Green river, Kentucky. In the aspect in which it is now presented the question involved concerns the right of the claimants to recover because of certain damages alleged to have been suffered by them which would not have accrued had the dam been backed with broken stone, sawdust, and sediment, as was stated in paragraph 33 of the specifications attached to the contract.\n The determination of this controversy requires reference to certain parts of the contract and the findings of the court of claims. The specifications provide, among other things:\n'20. It is understood and agreed that the quantities given are approximate only, and that no claim shall be made against the United States on account of any excess or deficiency, absolute or relative, in the same. Bidders, or their authorized agents, are expected to examine the maps and drawings in this office, which are open to their inspection, to visit the locality of the work, and to make their own estimates of the facilities and difficulties attending the execution of the proposed contract, including local conditions, uncertainty of weather, and all other contingencies.\n\n ... * *\n'33. Work to be done. . . . The present dam, a wooden crib structure, is 528 feet long between abutments and about 52 feet wide at its base. The expected depth of concrete work is shown on the blue prints, but it may be made greater as the condition of the old timber may render it necessary. The work shall be carried out in sections, generally from 50 to 100 feet long, and no more of the old work shall be torn out than can be rebuilt in a few days in \n\n[233 U.S. 165, 168]\n\u00a0\n case of necessity. All the exterior surfaces of the concrete shall be faced with the facing described in paragraph 59, which shall be placed before the concrete below has set, and shall be smoothly finished off. The dam is now backed for about 50 feet with broken stone, sawdust, and sediment to a height of within 2 or 3 feet of the crest, and it is expected that a cofferdam can be constructed with this stone, after which it can be backed with sawdust or other material. The excavation behind the dam will be required to go to the bottom, and it is thought that a slope of 1 horizontal to 1.2 vertical will give ample room.\n\n ... * *\n'60. Blue prints. Blue print drawings showing the method of construction may be seen at this office; they shall form a part of these specifications and shall not be departed from except as may be found necessary by the condition of the old timber encountered.\n\n ... * *\n'70. Investigation. It is expected that each bidder will visit the site of this work, the office of the lock master, and the office of the local engineer, and ascertain the nature of the work, the general character of the river as to floods and low water, and obtain the information necessary to enable him to make an intelligent proposal.'\n\n The court of claims found as a matter of fact, among other things:\n'As the contractors proceeded with the work of removing the material behind the dam it was found that said dam was not backed with broken stone, sawdust, and sediment, as stated in paragraph 33 of the specifications, but that said backing was composed of a soft, slushy sediment from a height of about 2 feet from the crest to an average depth of 7 feet, and below that to the bottom of the required excavation said dam was backed by cribwork of an average height of 4.3 feet, consisting of sound logs filled with stones.' \n\n[233 U.S. 165, 169]\n\u00a0\n The court of claims refused to enter judgment for the damages suffered by reason of the difference in the backing of the dam as found by the court, but estimated the damages for the matters in dispute in that respect to aggregate $6,549.23 (47 Ct. Cl. 236).\n\n In the course of its opinion the court below said that if paragraph 33 stood alone it would be a warranty of the material backing the dam. 'It was,' said the court, 'a positive and material representation as to a condition presumably within the knowledge of the government, and upon which, in the absence of any other provision or warning, the plaintiffs had a right to rely.' But the court held that the cautionary provisions of paragraph 20 and 70 required the claimants to inform themselves of the condition of the backing of the dam, and that when those paragraphs were read with paragraph 33 the statements and representations of the last- named paragraph could not be regarded as a warranty upon which the claimants had the right to rely, and the court reached this conclusion upon the authority of certain cases of its own and Simpson v. United States, \n172 U.S. 372\n, 43 L. ed. 482, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 212.\n In Simpson v. United States, supra, suit was brought upon a contract for the construction of a dry dock at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. It was discovered that the foundations upon which the dry dock rested contained quicksands which were unknown, and which were not shown in the drawings and plans inspected by the contractors before the making of the contract, and upon the strength of which the contractors had made their bid. This court held that the written contract merged all previous negotiations and must be presumed in law to express the final understanding of the parties. Of the contract itself the court said that it was clear that there was nothing in its terms which supported, even by remote implication, the premise upon which the claimants rested their right of recovery; that the contract contained no statement or \n\n[233 U.S. 165, 170]\n\u00a0\n agreement or even intimation of a warranty, express or implied, concerning the character of the underlying soil at the place where the dock was to be built; that the only word in the contract which supported the contention of warranty was that the dock was to be built in the navy yard upon a site which was 'available,' and that the word 'available' did not warrant against the quicksands which were found, and it certainly did appear that the site was available, for the dock was constructed upon it. It is therefore apparent that this case is entirely different from the one now under consideration, in the contents of the contract and specifications made part thereof, and that in the Simpson Case the claimants relied upon previous negotiations and information as to the site for the dock, developed in the plans showing the result of an examination made by government officers upon a portion of the yard, and did not depend, as here, upon the terms of the contract.\n In this case the claimants rely upon the contract, read in the light of the findings of the court of claims. Turning to paragraphs 20 and 70, the court of claims justified its conclusion in that part of paragraph 20 which provides that 'quantities given are approximate only, and that no claim shall be made against the United States on account of any excess or deficiency, absolute or relative, in the same. Bidders, or their authorized agents, are expected . . . to visit the locality of the work, and to make their own estimates,' etc.; and in that part of paragraph 70 which reads, 'it is expected that each bidder will visit the site of this work, . . . and ascertain the nature of the work,' etc. The term 'quantities,' as used in paragraph 20, may doubtless refer to estimates of the amount of different kinds of work which are specified in the contract. We do not see how it could control the statement of paragraph 33, definitely made, as to the character of the material back of the dam. Pertinent parts of the paragraphs \n\n[233 U.S. 165, 171]\n\u00a0\n referred to would seem to be those which required bidders or their authorized agents to investigate for themselves and to visit the locality of the work to ascertain its nature and make their own estimates thereof. The specifications attached to the contract set forth the work to be performed in great detail, as to its nature and character, and many particulars as to manner and extent of the work to be done, the removal of old timber and material, etc., the general character of the river as to floods and low water, etc., and the difficulties attending the execution of the contract, and as to all these things the bidder was required by paragraphs 20 and 70 to make examination for himself and at his own peril.\n In paragraph 33 the government sets forth with particularity a description of the old dam, its length and width, and it was there added: 'The dam is now backed for about 50 feet with broken stone, sawdust, and sediment to a height within 2 or 3 feet of the crest,' etc. The specifications provided that the excavations behind the dam must be to the bottom. In the light of this specification, turn to the finding of fact, and we learn that the claimants, as they proceeded with the work, found that the dam 'was not backed with broken stone, sawdust, and sediment, as stated in paragraph 33 of the specifications,' and below 7 feet from the top to the bottom there was a backing of cribbing of an average height of 4.3 feet of sound logs filled with stone. Obviously, this made it much more expensive to do the work than if the representation inserted by the government in the specifications of its own preparation had been true, and only the character of material had been found which the specification unequivocally asserted was there.\n A government contract should be interpreted as are contracts between individuals, with a view to ascertaining the intention of the parties and to give it effect accordingly, if that can be done consistently with the terms \n\n[233 U.S. 165, 172]\n\u00a0\n of the instrument. In paragraph 33 the specifications spoke with certainty as to a part of the conditions to be encountered by the claimants. True, the claimants might have penetrated the 7 feet of soft slushy sediment by means which would have discovered the log crib work filled with stones which was concealed below, but the specifications assured them of the character of the material,-a matter concerning which the government might be presumed to speak with knowledge and authority. We think this positive statement of the specifications must be taken as true and binding upon the government, and that upon it, rather than upon the claimants, must fall the loss resulting from such mistaken representations. We think it would be going quite too far to interpret the general language of the other paragraphs as requiring independent investigation of facts which the specifications furnished by the government as a basis of the contract left in no doubt. If the government wished to leave the matter open to the independent investigation of the claimants, it might easily have omitted the specification as to the character of the filling back of the dam. In its positive assertion of the nature of this much of the work it made a representation upon which the claimants had a right to rely without an investigation to prove its falsity. See United States v. Utah, N. & C. Stage Co. \n199 \nU.S. 414, 424\n, 50 S. L. ed. 252, 255, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 69.\n It follows that the judgment of the Court of Claims must be reversed and the case remanded to that court with directions to enter judgment for the claimants for the damages incurred because of the different character of material found behind the dam than that described in the specifications.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","90":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOLT v. HENLEY(1914)\nNo. 229\nArgued: March 5, 1914Decided: March 16, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 637, 638]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. S. O. Bland and R. T. Armistead for appellant.\n Messrs. Norvell L. Henley and o. d. Batchelor for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a petition to the district court, sitting in bankruptcy for leave to remove an automatic sprinkler system and equipment from the premises of the bankrupt, the Williamsburg Knitting Mill Company. It is opposed by the trustee of a mortgage of the plant of the company and the holder of the mortgage notes, and by the trustees in bankruptcy, both of which parties claim the property. The referee, the district court, and the circuit court of appeals, decided in favor of the latter claims. 190 Fed. 871, 113 C. C. A. 87, 193 Fed. 1020. The petitioner, Holt, appeals. The facts are as follows: An agreement to install the sprinkler was signed by Holt on August 28, 1909, and by the bankrupt on October 14, 1909. The installation was begun about December 6, 1909, and finished in the latter part of March, 1910, the equipment consisting of a 50,000-gallon tank on a steel tower, bolted to a concrete foundation, pipes connecting the tank with the mill. By the agreement the system was to remain Holt's property until paid for, and Holt was to have a right to enter and remove it upon a failure to pay as agreed. It also was to be personal property during the same time. A large part of the price has not been paid. But by the Code of Virginia,  2462, unless registered as therein provided, which this was not, such sales are void \n\n[232 U.S. 637, 639]\n\u00a0\n as to creditors (construed by the Virginia courts to mean lien creditors only), and as to purchasers for value without notice from the vendee. On November 23, 1909, the mortgage deed was executed, covering the plant on the premises, and that 'which may be acquired and placed upon the said premises during the continuance of this trust.' The mortgagees claim the system by virtue of this clause and the fact that it had been attached to the soil. As bearing on this last it should be added that there now is a smaller tank on the same steel tower, that supplies the mill for domestic purposes, but this was not put there by Holt.\n The trustees in bankruptcy join with Holt in disputing the claim of the mortgagees, but set up one of their own, which we will deal with before discussing that of the mortgagees. They rely upon the act of June 25, 1910, chap. 412,  8, 36 Stat. at L. 838, 840, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1500, amending  47a (2) of the bankruptcy act [30 Stat. at L. 557, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3438], and giving them, as to all property coming into the custody of the bankruptcy court, the rights of a creditor holding a lien. Before that amendment, Holt had a better title than the trustees would have got. York Mfg. Co. v. Cassell. \n201 U.S. 344\n, 50 L. ed. 782, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 481. We are of opinion that the act should not be construed to impair it. We do not need to consider whether or how far in any event the constitutional power of Congress would have been limited. It is enough that the reasonable and usual interpretation of such statutes is to confine their effect, so far as may be, to property rights established after they were passed. If, as they sometimes do, the registry statute had fixed a time within which the registration must take place, and the time had elapsed, we think it clear that the amendment would not be read as attempting to diminish Holt's rights. But the most obvious, if not the only, way of reaching that result, would be by taking the amendment to affect subsequently established rights alone. That is a familiar and natural mode of interpretation, whereas it \n\n[232 U.S. 637, 640]\n\u00a0\n would be highly artificial to say that it affected existing rights that still might be secured, but not those for which the chance had been lost. Therefore we think it immaterial if true, that for a month or two after the amendment was passed Holt might have docketed a memorandum, as provided by the Virginia act. The retention of title by him, and his refraining from recording it, both were perfectly lawful. His continuing title simply was postponed to purchasers without notice and creditors getting a lien. We are of opinion that it was not affected by the enactment of later date than the conditional sale. The opposite construction would not simply extend a remedy, but would impute to the act of Congress an intent to take away rights lawfully retained, and unimpeachable at the moment when they took their start. We agree with the decision in Arctic Ice Mach. Co. v. Armstrong County Trust Co. 112 C. C. A. 458, 192 Fed. 114; Re Schneider, 203 Fed. 589. See also Southwestern Coal & Improv. Co. v. McBride, \n185 \nU.S. 499, 503\n, 46 S. L. ed. 1010, 1012, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 763.\n We turn now to the claim of the mortgagees. This is based upon the clause extending the mortgage to plant that may be acquired and placed upon the premises while the mortgage is in force, coupled with the subsequent attachment of the system to the freehold. But the foundation upon which all their rights depend is the Virginia statute giving priority to purchasers for value without notice over Holt's unrecorded reservation of title; and as the mortgage deed was executed before the sprinkler system was put in, and the mortgagees made no advance on the faith of it, they were not purchasers for value as against Holt. York Mfg. Co. v. Cassell, \n201 \nU.S. 344, 351\n, 352 S., 50 L. ed. 782, 784, 785, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 481. There are no special facts to give them a better position in that regard. But that being so, what reason can be given for not respecting Holt's title as against them? The system was attached to the freehold, but it could be removed without any serious harm for which complaint \n\n[232 U.S. 637, 641]\n\u00a0\n could be made against Holt, other than the loss of the system itself. Removal would not affect the integrity of the structure on which the mortgagees advanced. To hold that the mere fact of annexing the system to the freehold overrode the agreement that it should remain personalty and still belong to Holt would be to give a mystic importance to attachment by bolts and screws. For, as we have said, the mortgagees have no equity and do not bring themselves within the statutory provision. We believe the better rule in a case like this, and the one consistent with the Virginia decisions so far as they have gone, is that 'the mortgagees take just such an interest in the property as the mortgagor acquired; no more, no less.'

HEBARD(1914)\nNo. 30\nArgued: Decided: November 30, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 287, 288]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. Bentley Matthews for petitioners.\n Messrs. John Franklin Shields, William A. Stone, and T. E. H. McCroskey for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the court:\n In 1907, petitioners, alleged successors to David W. Belding and others, filed a bill of review against the heirs and representatives of Charles Hebard in the United States circuit court, eastern district of Tennessee, wherein they sought to reverse the decree for complainant, granted by the same court, June 10, 1899, and later affirmed by the circuit court of appeals in the cause entitled Hebard v. Belding, which was instituted to determine the title to some 7,000 acres of mountain land. The Smoky Mountain Land, Lumber, & Improvement Company intervened, denied the alleged equities, \n\n[235 U.S. 287, 289]\n\u00a0\n and set up that it had purchased the property for value and in good faith. The trial court, having heard the matter upon the pleadings and evidence, dismissed the bill; and this was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals ( 114 C. C. A. 261, 194 Fed. 301). The cause is here upon certiorari.\n The land in controversy lies on the waters of Slick Rock Creek, an affluent of the Little Tennessee river, and for some time prior to 1895 was claimed by Hebard under a grant from the state of Tennessee. Belding and others claimed it under a North Carolina grant. The rights of the disputants depended on the true location of the dividing line between the two states. If, after crossing the Little Tennessee, the line ran southward along Hangover ridge, the land was within Tennessee and belonged to Hebard; if, on the other hand, it ran along Slick Rock creek, the North Carolina grant was good, and Belding and others were the owners. In 1895 Hebard began a suit in the chancery court, Monroe county, Tennessee, seeking an adjudication of his rights. This was removed to the United States circuit court; elaborate proofs were taken; and, upon the hearing, the court determined that the state line ran along Hangover ridge, as contended by Hebard, and adjudged the title to be in him. The circuit court of appeals, in a final decree, entered July 13, 1900, affirmed this action, the opinion being written by the late Mr. Justice Lurton (43 C. C. A. 296, 103 Fed. 532).\n Some years before the present suit was brought, the Smoky Mountain Land, Lumber, & Improvement Company, relying upon the last-mentioned final decree in the circuit court of appeals, in good faith and for value, acquired the interest of Hebard. As security for debt, Belding and others, by deeds of December, 1899, and March, 1900, transferred to Archer and McGarry, trustees, with power of sale, their interest in a large tract of land the boundaries of which included the 7,000 acres now in question, 'subject, nevertheless, to all deduc- \n\n[235 U.S. 287, 290]\n\u00a0\n tions, if any, arising by, through, or under the 'State Line' suit hereinafter mentioned' (Hebard v. Belding). Default having occurred, the trustees executed a deed to William R. Hopkins and others, petitioners here, with covenants of seisin and right to convey and special warranty; but from the covenants they expressly excepted 'all those lands situated at or near the state line, between the state of North Carolina and Tennessee, which were recovered in a certain action known as the 'State Line Suit,' which was pending in the United States circuit court for the eastern district of Tennessee, and was brought by one Hebard against David W. Belding and others, if future proceedings do not recover the title thereof.'\n During the year 1821, commissioners appointed by North Carolina and Tennessee located and marked the southern portion of the dividing line between the two states, and prepared a map roughly indicating it. After being lost for many years, in December, 1903, or early in 1904, this was found among old, discarded papers stored in the basement of the Capitol at Nashville. Relying on the map as newly discovered evidence, adequate, when considered in connection with that formerly introduced, to demonstrate that the dividing line between the two states ran along Slick Rock creek, and to establish the invalidity of the Tennessee grant under which Hebard claimed, petitioners began the present proceeding.\n Likewise relying in part upon the same map, the state of North Carolina in March, 1909, presented an original bill in this court against Tennessee, claiming that the true line between them ran along Slick Rock creek, and praying an adjudication to that effect. In an opinion recently announced, the contention of North Carolina was sustained. North Carolina v. Tennessee, \n235 U.S. 1\n, 59 L. ed. --, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 8.\n The function of a bill of review filed for newly discovered evidence is to relieve a meritorious complainant from a \n\n[235 U.S. 287, 291]\n\u00a0\n clear miscarriage of justice where the court is able to see, upon a view of all the circumstances, that the remedy can be applied without mischief to the rights of innocent parties, and without unduly jeopardizing the stability of judicial decrees. The remedy is not a matter of absolute right, but of sound discretion. Thomas v. Brockenbrough, 10 Wheat. 146, 6 L. ed. 287; Ricker v. Powell, \n100 \nU.S. 104, 107\n, 25 S. L. ed. 527, 528; Craig v.

Pr.  2143, 2156, 2159; Gibson, Suit in Ch.  1058, 1062\n\n\n The trial court regarded the newly discovered evidence as favorable, rather than in opposition, to the original decree, and accordingly dismissed the petitioners' bill. The circuit court of appeals, in a well- considered opinion, upheld the result, but for a different reason, saying: 'In our opinion, taking into account not only the speculative purchase by appellants, but also the good-faith purchase by the Smoky Mountain Company, a case is not presented which appeals to the equitable discretion of the court to allow the review of a decree upon the ground alone of newly discovered evidence. We rest our decision solely upon this proposition. Bearing in mind the rule that this bill of review for newly discovered evidence is not of right, no matter how persuasive of error in the original decree the new evidence may be, and that it should not be allowed if such allowance would result in mischief to innocent parties, and having in view the stability necessary to be afforded to decrees, especially of courts of last resort, where disturbance thereof is not essential to the protection of the real equities of the parties before the court, we think the review asked for should be denied. In our opinion, the stability of judgments, and thus the protection of rights acquired in reliance upon them, are such as, under the peculiar circumstances of this case, to make the review asked for inequitable.' \n\n[235 U.S. 287, 292]\n\u00a0\n Notwithstanding our conclusion in the proceedings between the states of North Carolina and Tennessee, where the established facts in respect to the location of the dividing line were, for the most part, the same as those disclosed in the record now before us, we think the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals was right, and it is accordingly affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Day took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","92":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOUSTON, E. & W.

The complaint was that the appellants, and other interstate carriers, maintained unreasonable rates from Shreveport, Louisiana, to various points in Texas, and, further, that these carriers, in the adjustment of rates over their respective lines, unjustly discriminated in favor of traffic within the state of Texas, and against similar traffic between Louisiana and Texas. The carriers filed answers; numerous pleas of intervention by shippers and commercial bodies were allowed; testimony was taken and arguments were heard.\n The gravamen of the complaint, said the Interstate \n\n[234 U.S. 342, 346]\n\u00a0\n Commerce Commission, was that the carriers made rates out of Dallas and other Texas points into eastern Texas which were much lower than those which they extended into Texas from Shreveport. The situation may be briefly described: Shreveport, Louisiana, is about 40 miles from the Texas state line, and 231 miles from Houston, Texas, on the line of the Houston, East & West Texas and Houston & Shreveport Companies (which are affiliated in interest); it is 189 miles from Dallas, Texas, on the line of the Texas & Pacific. Shreveport competes with both cities for the trade of the intervening territory. The rates on these lines from Dallas and Houston, respectively, eastward to intermediate points in Texas, were much less, according to distance, than from Shreveport westward to the same points. It is undisputed that the difference was substantial, and injuriously affected the commerce of Shreveport. It appeared, for example, that a rate of 60 cents carried first-class traffic a distance of 160 miles to the eastward from Dallas, while the same rate would carry the same class of traffic only 55 miles into Texas from Shreveport. The first-class rate from Houston to Lufkin, Texas, 118.2 miles, was 50 cents per 100 pounds, while the rate from Shreveport to the same point, 112.5 miles, was 69 cents. The rate on wagons from Dallas to Marshall, Texas, 147.7 miles was 36.8 cents, and from Shreveport to Marshall, 42 miles, 56 cents. The rate on furniture from Dallas to Longview, Texas, 124 miles, was 24.8 cents, and that from Shreveport to Longview, 65.7 miles was 35 cents. These instances of differences in rates are merely illustrative; they serve to indicate the character of the rate adjustment.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission found that the interstate class rates out of Shreveport to named Texas points were unreasonable, and it established maximum class rates for this traffic. These rates, we understand, were substantially the same as the class rates fixed by the \n\n[234 U.S. 342, 347]\n\u00a0\n Railroad Commission of Texas, and charged by the carriers, for transportation for similar distances in that state. The Interstate Commerce Commission also found that the carriers maintained 'higher rates from Shreveport to points in Texas' than were in force 'from cities in Texas to such points under substantially similar conditions and circumstances,' and that thereby 'an unlawful and undue preference and advantage' was given to the Texas cities, and a 'discrimination' that was 'undue and unlawful' was effected against Shreveport. In order to correct this discrimination, the carriers were directed to desist from charging higher rates for the transportation of any commodity from Shreveport to Dallas and Houston, respectively, and intermediate than were contemporaneously charged for the carriage of such commodity from Dallas and Houston toward Shreveport for equal distances, as the Commission found that relation of rates to be reasonable. 23 Inters. Com. Rep. 31, 46-48.\n The order in question is set forth in the margin. \n2\n The \n\n[234 U.S. 342, 348]\n\u00a0\n report states that under this order it will be the duty of the companies 'to duly and justly equalize the terms and conditions' upon which they will extend 'transportation to traffic of a similar character, moving into Texas from \n___ any article from Shreveport, Louisiana, to Dallas, Texas, and points on its lines intermediate thereto, than are contemporaneously exacted for the transportation of such article from Dallas, Texas, toward said Shreveport for an equal distance, as said relation of rates has been found by the Commission in said report to be reasonable.\n'It is further ordered, that defendants the Houston, East & West Texas Railway Company and Houston & Shreveport Railroad Company be, and they are hereby, notified and required to cease and desist, on or before the 1st day of May, 1912, and for a period of not less than two years thereafter abstain, from exacting any higher rates for the transportation of any article from Shreveport, Louisiana, to Houston, Texas, and points on its line intermediate thereto, than are contemporaneously exacted for the transportation of such article from Houston, Texas, toward said Shreveport for an equal distance, as said relation of rates has been found by the Commission in said report to be reasonable.\n\n'And it is further ordered, that said defendants be, and they are hereby, notified and required to establish and put in force, on or before the 1st day of May, 1912, and maintain in force thereafter during a period of not less than two years, substantially similar practices respecting the concentration of interstate cotton at Shreveport, Louisiana, to those which are contemporaneously observed by said defendants respecting the concentration of cotton within the state of Texas, provided the practices adopted shall be justifiable under the act to regulate commerce, and applicable fairly under like conditions elsewhere on the lines of such defendants.' \n\n[234 U.S. 342, 349]\n\u00a0\n Shreveport, with that moving wholly within Texas,' but that, in effecting such equalization, the class scale rates as prescribed shall not be exceeded.\n\n In their petition in the commerce court, the appellants assailed the order in its entirety, but subsequently they withdrew their opposition to the fixing of maximum class rates, and these rates were put in force by the carriers in May, 1912. The attack was continued upon that portion of the order which prohibited the charge of higher rates for carrying articles from Shreveport into Texas than those charged for eastward traffic from Dallas and Houston, respectively, for equal distances. There are, it appears, commodity rates fixed by the Railroad Commission of Texas for intrastate hauls, which are substantially less than the class, or standard, rates prescribed by that Commission; and thus the commodity rates charged by the carriers from Dallas and Houston eastward to Texas points are less than the rates which they demand for the transportation of the same articles for like distances from Shreveport into Texas. The present controversy relates to these commodity rates.\n The point of the objection to the order is that, as the discrimination found by the Commission to be unjust arises out of the relation of intrastate rates, maintained under state authority, to interstate rates that have been upheld as reasonable, its correction was beyond the Commission's power. Manifestly the order might be complied with, and the discrimination avoided, either by reducing the interstate rates from Shreveport to the level of the competing intrastate rates, or by raising these in- \n\n[234 U.S. 342, 350]\n\u00a0\n trastate rates to the level of the interstate rates, or by such reduction in the one case and increase in the other as would result in equality. But it is urged that, so far as the interstate rates were sustained by the Commission as reasonable, the Commission was without authority to compel their reduction in order to equalize them with the lower intrastate rates. The holding of the commerce court was that the order relieved the appellants from further obligation to observe the intrastate rates, and that they were at liberty to comply with the Commission's requirements by increasing these rates sufficiently to remove the forbidden discrimination. The invalidity of the order in this aspect is challenged upon two grounds:\n\n\n (1)\n That Congress is impotent to control the intrastate charges of an interstate carrier even to the extent necessary to prevent injurious discrimination against interstate traffic; and\n\n\n (2)\n That, if it be assumed that Congress has this power, still it has not been exercised, and hence the action of the Commission exceeded the limits of the authority which has been conferred upon it.\n First. It is unnecessary to repeat what has frequently been said by this court with respect to the complete and paramount character of the power confided to Congress to regulate commerce among the several states. It is of the essence of this power that, where it exists, it dominates. Interstate trade was not left to be destroyed or impeded by the rivalries of local government. The purpose was to make impossible the recurrence of the evils which had overwhelmed the Confederation, and to provide the necessary basis of national unity by insuring 'uniformity of regulation against conflicting and discriminating state legislation.' By virtue of the comprehensive terms of the grant, the authority of Congress is at all times adequate to meet the varying exigencies that arise, and to protect the national interest by securing the freedom of interstate \n\n[234 U.S. 342, 351]\n\u00a0\n commercial intercourse from local control.

Rep. 729.\n Congress is empowered to regulate,-that is, to provide the law for the government of interstate commerce; to enact 'all appropriate legislation' for its 'protection and advancement' (The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 564, 19 L. ed. 999, 1001); to adopt measures 'to promote its growth and insure its safety' (Mobile County v. Kimball, \n102 \nU.S. 691, 696\n, 697 S., 29 L. ed. 238-240); 'to foster, protect, control, and restrain' ( Second Employers' Liability Cases [Mondou v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co.] \n223 \nU.S. 1, 47\n, 53 S., 54, 56 L. ed. 327, 345, 347, 348, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 44, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 169, 1 N. C. C. A. 875). Its authority, extending to these interstate carriers as instruments of interstate commerce, necessarily embraces the right to control their operations in all matters having such a close and substantial relation to interstate traffic that the control is essential or appropriate to the security of that traffic, to the efficiency of the interstate service, and to the maintenance of conditions under which interstate commerce may be conducted upon fair terms and without molestation or hindrance. As it is competent for Congress to legislate to these ends, unquestionably it may seek their attainment by requiring that the agencies of interstate commerce shall not be used in such manner as to cripple, retard, or destroy it. The fact that carriers are instruments of intrastate commerce, as well as of interstate commerce, does not derogate from the complete and paramount authority of Congress over the latter, or preclude the Federal power from being exerted to prevent the intrastate operations of such carriers from being made a means of injury to that which has been confided to Federal care. Wherever the interstate and intrastate transactions of carriers are so related that the government of the one involves the control of the other, it is Congress, and not the state, that is entitled to pre- \n\n[234 U.S. 342, 352]\n\u00a0\n scribe the final and dominant rule, for otherwise Congress would be denied the exercise of its constitutional authority, and the state, and not the nation, would be supreme within the national field.

United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20, 26\n, 27 S., 56 L. ed. 72, 74, 75, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 2, 3 N. C. C. A. 822; Second Employers' Liability Cases (Mondou v. New York, N. H. & H. R.

Shepard) \n230 U.S. 431\n, 57 L. ed. 1554, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1151, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 729; Illinois C. R. Co. v. Behrens, decided April 27, 1914 [\n233 U.S. 473\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 646].\n In Baltimore & O. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, supra, the argument against the validity of the hours of service act (March 4, 1907, chap. 2939, 34 Stat. at L. 14, 15, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1321) involved the consideration that the interstate and intrastate transactions of the carriers were so interwoven that it was utterly impracticable for them to divide their employees so that those who were engaged in interstate commerce should be confined to that commerce exclusively. Employees dealing with the movement of trains were employed in both sorts of commerce; but the court held that this fact did not freclude the exercise of Federal power. As Congress could limit the hours of labor of those engaged in interstate transportation, it necessarily followed that its will could not be frustrated by prolonging the period of service through other requirements of the carriers, or by the commingling of duties relating to interstate and intrastate operations. Again, in Southern R. Co. v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20, 26\n, 27 S., 56 L. ed. 72, 74, 75, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 2, 3 N. C. C. A. 822, the question was presented whether the amendment to the safety appliance act (March 2, 1903, 32 Stat. at L. 943, chap. 976, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1314) was within the power of Congress in view of the fact that the statute was not confined to vehicles that were used in interstate traffic, but also embraced those used in intrastate traffic. The court answered affirmatively, because there was such a close relation between the two classes of traffic moving over the same railroad as to make it certain that the safety \n\n[234 U.S. 342, 353]\n\u00a0\n of the interstate traffic, and of those employed in its movement, would be promoted in a real and substantial sense by applying the requirements of the act to both classes of vehicles. So, in the Second Employers' Liability Cases, supra, it was insisted that while Congress had the authority to regulate the liability of a carrier for injuries sustained by one employee through the negligence of another, where all were engaged in interstate commerce, that power did not embrace instances where the negligent employee was engaged in intrastate commerce. The court said that this was a mistaken theory, as the causal negligence, when operating injuriously upon an employee engaged in interstate commerce, had the same effect with respect to that commerce as if the negligent employee were also engaged therein. The decision in Employers' Liability Cases (Howard v. Illinois C. R. Co.) \n207 U.S. 463\n, 52 L. ed. 297, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 141, is not opposed, for the statute there in question (June 11, 1906, chap. 3073, 34 Stat. at L. 232, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1316) sought to regulate the liability of interstate carriers for injuries to any employee even though his employment had no connection whatever with interstate commerce. See Illinois C. R. Co. v. Behrens, \n233 U.S. 473\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 646.\n While these decisions sustaining the Federal power relate to measures adopted in the interest of the safety of persons and property, they illustrate the principle that Congress, in the exercise of its paramount power, may prevent the common instrumentalities of interstate and intrastate commercial intercourse from being used in their intrastate operations to the injury of interstate commerce. This is not to say that Congress possesses the authority to regulate the internal commerce of a state, as such, but that it does possess the power to foster and protect interstate commerce, and to take all measures necessary or appropriate to that end, although intrastate transactions of interstate carriers may thereby be controlled.\n This principle is applicable here. We find no reason to doubt that Congress is entitled to keep the highways of \n\n[234 U.S. 342, 354]\n\u00a0\n interstate communication open to interstate traffic upon fair and equal terms. That an unjust discrimination in the rates of a common carrier, by which one person or locality is unduly favored as against another under substantially similar conditions of traffic, constitutes an evil, is undeniable; and where this evil consists in the action of an interstate carrier in unreasonably discriminating against interstate traffic over its line, the authority of Congress to prevent it is equally clear. It is immaterial, so far as the protecting power of Congress is concerned, that the discrimination arises from intrastate rates as compared with interstate rates. The use of the instrument of interstate commerce in a discriminatory manner so as to inflict injury upon that commerce, or some part thereof, furnishes abundant ground for Federal intervention. Nor can the attempted exercise of state authority alter the matter, where Congress has acted, for a state may not authorize the carrier to do that which Congress is entitled to forbid and has forbidden.\n It is to be noted-as the government has well said in its argument in support of the Commission's order-that the power to deal with the relation between the two kinds of rates, as a relation, lies exclusively with Congress. It is manifest that the state cannot fix the relation of the carrier's interstate and intrastate charges without directly interfering with the former, unless it simply follows the standard set by Federal authority. This question was presented with respect to the long and short haul provision of the Kentucky Constitution, adopted in 1891, which the court had before it in Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Eubank, \n184 U.S. 27\n, 46 L. ed. 416, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 277. The state court had construed this provision as embracing a long haul, from a place outside to one within the state, and a shorter haul on the same line and in the same direction between points within the state. This court held that, so construed, the provision was invalid as being a regulation of interstate commerce \n\n[234 U.S. 342, 355]\n\u00a0\n because 'it linked the interstate rate to the rate for the shorter haul, and thus the interstate charge was directly controlled by the state law.' See 230 U. S. pp. 428, 429. It is for Congress to supply the needed correction where the relation between intrastate and interstate rates presents the evil to be corrected, and this it may do completely, by reason of its control over the interstate carrier in all matters having such a close and substantial relation to interstate commerce that it is necessary or appropriate to exercise the control for the effective government of that commerce.\n It is also clear that, in removing the injurious discriminations against interstate traffic arising from the relation of intrastate to interstate rates, Congress is not bound to reduce the latter below what it may deem to be a proper standard, fair to the carrier and to the public. Otherwise, it could prevent the injury to interstate commerce only by the sacrifice of its judgment as to interstate rates. Congress is entitled to maintain its own standard as to these rates, and to forbid any discriminatory action by interstate carriers which will obstruct the freedom of movement of interstate traffic over their lines in accordance with the terms it establishes.\n Having this power, Congress could provide for its execution through the aid of a subordinate body; and we conclude that the order of the Commission now in question cannot be held invalid upon the ground that it exceeded the authority which Congress could lawfully confer.\n Second. The remaining question is with regard to the scope of the power which Congress has granted to the Commission.\n Section 3 of the act to regulate commerce provides (24 Stat. at L. 3798 380, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3154, 3155):\n Sec. 3. That it shall be unlawful for any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to \n\n[234 U.S. 342, 356]\n\u00a0\n any particular person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, in any respect whatsoever, or to subject any particular person, company, firm, corporation, or locality, or any particular description of traffic, to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.'\n This language is certainly sweeping enough to embrace all the discriminations of the sort described which it was within the power of Congress to condemn. There is no exception or qualification with respect to an unreasonable discrimination against interstate traffic produced by the relation of intrastate to interstate rates as maintained by the carrier. It is apparent from the legislative history of the act that the evil of discrimination was the principal thing aimed at, and there is no basis for the contention that Congress intended to exempt any discriminatory action or practice of interstate carriers affecting interstate commerce which it had authority to reach. The purpose of the measure was thus emphatically stated in the elaborate report of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce which accompanied it: 'The provisions of the bill are based upon the theory that the paramount evil chargeable against the operation of the transportation system of the United States as now conducted is unjust discrimination between persons, places, commodities, or particular descriptions of traffic, The underlying purpose and aim of the measure is the prevention of these discriminations' (Senate Report No. 46, 49th Cong. 1st Sess. p. 215).\n The opposing argument rests upon the proviso in the 1st section of the act which, in its original form, was as follows: 'Provided, however, that the provisions of this act shall not apply to the transportation of passengers or property, or to the receiving, delivering, storage, or handling of property, wholly within one state, and not shipped to or from a foreign country from or to any state or ter- \n\n[234 U.S. 342, 357]\n\u00a0\n ritory as aforesaid.' When the act was amended so as to confer upon the Commission the authority to prescribe maximum interstate rates, this proviso was re-enacted; and when the act was extended to include telegraph, telephone, and cable companies engaged in interstate business, an additional clause was inserted so as to exclude intrastate messages. See acts of June 20, 1906, chap. 3591, 34 Stat. at L. 584; June 18, 1910, chap. 309, 36 Stat. at L. 539, 545, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1288\n\n\n Congress thus defined the scope of its regulation, and provided that it was not to extend to purely intrastate traffic. It did not undertake to authorize the Commission to prescribe intrastate rates, and thus to establish a unified control by the exercise of the rate-making power over both descriptions of traffic. Undoubtedly-in the absence of a finding by the Commission of unjust discrimination-intrastate rates were left to be fixed by the carrier, and subject to the authority of the states, or of the agencies created by the states. This was the question recently decided by this court in the Minnesota Rate Cases (Simpson v. Shepard) \n230 U.S. 352\n, 57 L. ed. 1511, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1151, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 729. There, the state of Minnesota had established reasonable rates for intrastate transportation throughout the state, and it was contended that, by reason of the passage of the act to regulate commerce, the state could no longer exercise the state-wide authority for this purpose which it had formerly enjoyed; and the court was asked to hold that an entire scheme of intrastate rates, otherwise validly established, was null and void because of its effect upon interstate rates. There had been no finding by the Interstate Commerce Commission of any unjust discrimination. The present question, however, was reserved, the court saying (230 U. S. p. 419): 'It is urged, however, that the words of the proviso' (referring to the proviso above-mentioned) 'are susceptible of a construction which would permit the provisions of  3 of the act, prohibiting carriers from giving an undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any locality, to apply to unreasonable discriminations \n\n[234 U.S. 342, 358]\n\u00a0\n between localities in different states, as well when arising from an intrastate rate as compared with an interstate rate as when due to interstate rates exclusively. If it be assumed that the statute should be so construed, and it is not necessary now to decide the point, it would inevitably follow that the controlling principle governing the enforcement of the act should be applied to such cases as might thereby be brought within its purview; and the question whether the carrier, in such a case, was giving an undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to one locality as against another, or subjecting any locality to an undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage, would be primarily for the investigation and determination of the interstate Commerce Commission, and not for the courts.'\n Here, the Commission expressly found that unjust discrimination existed under substantially similar conditions of transportation, and the inquiry is whether the Commission had power to correct it. We are of the opinion that the limitation of the proviso in  1 does not apply to a case of this sort. The Commission was dealing with the relation of rates injuriously affecting, through an unreasonable discrimination, traffic that was interstate. The question was thus not simply one of transportation that was 'wholly within one state.' These words of the proviso have appropriate reference to exclusively intrastate traffic, separately considered; to the regulation of domestic commerce, as such. The powers conferred by the act are not thereby limited where interstate commerce itself is involved. This is plainly the case when the Commission finds that unjust discrimination against interstate trade arises from the relation of intrastate to interstate rates as maintained by a carrier subject to the act. Such a matter is one with which Congress alone is competent to deal, and, in view of the aim of the act and the comprehensive terms of the provisions against unjust discrimination, \n\n[234 U.S. 342, 359]\n\u00a0\n there is no ground for holding that the authority of Congress was unexercised, and that the subject was thus left without governmental regulation. It is urged that the practical construction of the statute has been the other way. But, in assailing the order, the appellants ask us to override the construction which has been given to the statute by the authority charged with its execution, and it cannot be said that the earlier action of the Commission was of such a controlling character as to preclude it from giving effect to the law. The Commission, having before it a plain case of unreasonable discrimination on the part of interstate carriers against interstate trade, carefully examined the question of its authority, and decided that it had the power to make this remedial order. The commerce court sustained the authority of the Commission, and it is clear that we should not reverse the decree unless the law has been misapplied. This we cannot say; on the contrary, we are convinced that the authority of the Commission was adequate.\n The further objection is made that the prohibition of  3 is directed against unjust discrimination or undue preference only when it arises from the voluntary act of the carrier, and does not relate to acts which are the result of conditions wholly beyond its control. East Tennessee, V. & G. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n181 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 45 S. L. ed. 719, 725, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 516. The reference is not to any inherent lack of control arising out of traffic conditions, but to the requirements of the local authorities, which are assumed to be binding upon the carriers. The contention is thus merely a repetition in another form of the argument that the Commission exceeded its power; for it would not be contended that local rules could nullify the lawful exercise of Federal authority. In the view that the Commission was entitled to make the order, there is no longer compulsion upon the carriers by virtue of any inconsistent local requirement. We are not unmindful of the gravity of the \n\n[234 U.S. 342, 360]\n\u00a0\n question that is presented when state and Federal views conflict. But it was recognized at the beginning that the nation could not prosper if interstate and foreign trade were governed by many masters, and, where the interests of the freedom of interstate commerce are involved, the judgment of Congress and of the agencies it lawfully establishes must control.\n In conclusion: Reading the order in the light of the report of the Commission, it does not appear that the Commission attempted to require the carriers to reduce their interstate rates out of Shreveport below what was found to be a reasonable charge for that service. So far as these interstate rates conformed to what was found to be reasonable by the Commission, the carriers are entitled to maintain them, and they are free to comply with the order by so adjusting the other rates, to which the order relates, as to remove the forbidden discrimination. But this result they are required to accomplish.\n The decree of the Commerce Court is affirmed in each case.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice Lurton and Mr. Justice Pitney dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Missouri, Kansas, & Texas Railway Company of Texas, the St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company, and the St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company of Texas. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'This case being at issue upon complaint and answers on file, and having been duly heard and submitted by the parties, and full investigation of the matters and things involved having been had, and the Commission having, on the date hereof, made and filed a report containing its findings of fact and conclusions thereon, which said report is hereby referred to and made a part hereof:\n'It is ordered, that defendants the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, the Houston, East & West Texas Railway Company, and Houston & Shreveport Railroad Company, be, and they are hereby, notified and required to cease and desist, on or before the 1st day of May, 1912, and for a period of not less than two years thereafter abstain, from exacting their present class rates for the transportation of traffic from Shreveport, Louisiana, to the points in Texas hereinafter mentioned on their respective lines, as the Commission in said report finds such rates to be unjust and unreasonable.\n\n'It is further ordered, that defendant the Texas & Pacific Railway Company be, and it is hereby, notified and required to establish and put in force, on or before the 1st day of May, 1912, and maintain in force thereafter during a period of not less than two years, and apply to the transportation of traffic from Shreveport, Louisiana, to the below-named points in Texas, class rates which shall not exceed the following, in cents per 100 pounds, which rates are found by the Commission in its report to be reasonable, to wit: (rates inserted).\n\n'It is further ordered that defendants the Houston, East & West Texas Railway Company and Houston & Shreveport Railroad Company be, and they are hereby, notified and required to establish and put in force, on or before the 1st day of May, 1912, and maintain in force thereafter during a period of not less than two years, and apply to the transportation of traffic from Shreveport, Louisiana, to the below-named points in Texas, class rates which shall not exceed the following, in cents per 100 pounds, which rates are found by the Commission in its report to be reasonable, to wit: ( rates inserted).\n\n'It is further ordered, that defendant the Texas & Pacific Railway Company be, and it is hereby, notified and required to cease and desist, on or before the 1st day of May, 1912, and for a period of not less than two years thereafter abstain, from exacting any higher rates for the transportation of \n\n\n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHULL v. BURR(1914)\nNo. 767\nArgued: March 3, 1914Decided: June 22, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. George C. Bedell and H. Bisbee for appellants. \n\n[234 U.S. 712, 713]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank L. Simpson, E. R. Gunby, and James F. Glen for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n The appellants, Joseph Hull, the Prairie Pebble Phosphate Company ( hereinafter referred to as the Prairie Company), and the Savannah Trust Company, brought this action in equity in the district court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts against appellees, Arthur E. Burr, Frank L. Simpson, and J. Howard Edwards, who are trustees in bankruptcy of the Port Tampa Phosphate Company, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Massachusetts. The bill was filed in August, 1912, and, defendants having demurred, an amended bill was filed, and it was stipulated that the demurrer should stand as a demurrer to the substituted bill. The district court entered a decree sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill (124 C. C. A. 135, 206 Fed. 1). The circuit court of appeals affirmed the decree (124 C. C. A. 138, 206 Fed. 4 ), and denied a petition for rehearing (207 Fed. 543).\n The amended bill, besides showing diversity of citizenship, avers in substance as follows: That prior to the transactions in question, Stewart and Meminger were the owners in fee simple of a tract of land in polk county, Florida, containing 440 acres, together with certain buildings and personal property situate upon it; that on May 22, 1905, in consummation of a prior contract, they conveyed all their right, title, and interest in the property to Hull by deed duly recorded, which vested in him a good legal title in fee simple to the real estate, with full title to the personal property and the right to possession as against all persons, 'and his recorded paper title to all the said properties was perfect;' that before the delivery of the deed by Stewart and Meminger to Hull the Port Tampa \n\n[234 U.S. 712, 714]\n\u00a0\n Company claimed to own some equitable interest in the property, under a contract between it and Stewart and Meminger, which interest Hull purchased for a full consideration, and before the delivery of said deed to Hull the Port Tampa Company adopted and placed upon its records a resolution reciting its agreement to sell the property to Hull, and authorizing and directing Stewart and Meminger to make a deed to him; that soon after the delivery of the deed Hull took possession; that on June 7, 1907, he executed and delivered to the Prairie Company a deed of conveyance of all his right, title, and interest in said properties for the consideration of about $37,000, which deed was shortly afterwards recorded, and the Prairie Company took actual and peaceable possession of the property, and has continued to hold it until the present time, having made valuable improvements upon it; that afterwards, and prior to March 26, 1908, the Prairie Company executed and delivered to the Trust Company a deed of trust conveying its right, title, and interest in said properties, together with other properties, to secure the payment of bonds amounting to about $1,800,000, and the deed of trust was duly recorded; that it came to the knowledge of Hull that certain creditors of the Port Tampa Company had asserted that the company owned some interest in said properties, and on the 28th of November, 1905, he commenced an action of ejectment against that company in the United States circuit court for the southern district of Florida being the district in which the property was situate; that the company was served with process therein on December 6, 1905, and such further proceedings were had that on March 13, 1906, upon the verdict of a jury, a judgment was rendered adjudging that Hull was entitled to recover from the Port Tampa Company the fee-simple title and right of possession of the lands in question. The bill sets up that on November 8, 1905, a petition in bank- \n\n[234 U.S. 712, 715]\n\u00a0\n ruptcy was filed against the Port Tampa Company 'in this court of bankruptcy' [the district court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts]; that a subpoena was issued thereon returnable on the 20th day of the same month, and returned served, and that on the return day an appearance was entered for the company by one J. H. Robinson. Copies of the creditor's petition, the subpoena, and the appearance are appended to the bill as an exhibit. The bill alleges that defendants assert that by virtue of a decree in bankrupty made in said district court on November 27, 1905, adjudging the Port Tampa Company bankrupt, they are the owners of an equitable interest or estate in the said lands and other properties, and that the defendant Burr was, on December 27, 1905, appointed sole trustee in bankruptcy of the company; that he resigned as such trustee on March 12, 1909, and on the same day his resignation was accepted, and Burr, Simpson, and Edwards were appointed trustees in his place; and that defendants claim that by the adjudication in bankruptcy and their appointment the title to an interest or estate in said lands became vested in them as such trustees; that on or about March 26, 1908, and before he resigned as trustee, Burr brought a suit by bill in equity in the circuit court in and for Polk county, Florida, against complainants, to establish such interest or estate, but there has been no trial of this suit on the merits, nor had the same been brought to final issues of fact and law before Burr's resignation; that on January 9, 1912, the defendants filed in said state court a supplemental bill of complaint, wherein they averred that said suit was brought by Burr as trustee in bankruptcy, and that Burr resigned as such trustee on March 12, 1909, and prayed that they might be substituted as complainants in his place; that the present complainants filed an answer to the said supplemental bill, but that the issues have not been tried, and no decree has been rendered mak- \n\n[234 U.S. 712, 716]\n\u00a0\n ing the defendants as trustees complainants in said suit. The present bill then proceeds to attack the proceedings and adjudication in bankruptcy, and the title of the defendants as trustees, as fraudulent and void upon various grounds, which may be summarized as follows: That the Port Tampa Company's principal place of business was not in Massachusetts, as alleged in the petition, and that it had no business except in Florida; that it was not insolvent, and did not commit the act of bankruptcy alleged, or any act of bankruptcy; that the petitioning creditors were directors of the company, and knew the company was solvent and had committed no act of bankruptcy; that the jurisdictional facts were falsely and fraudulently averred, being fabricated for the purpose of pretending to state a cause within the jurisdiction of the court; that the petitioning creditors controlled both sides of the litigation through their ownership of a majority of the company's stock; that Robinson, who entered the appearance in behalf of the Port Tampa Company, was not in fact authorized to appear for or represent the company; and that the petition was fraudulently made to appear as an involuntary petition by creditors, whereas in truth and in legal effect it was a voluntary petition on the part of the company and its officers and directors. It is also alleged that the appointment of defendants as trustees in the place of Burr on March 12, 1909, was invalid, because no judge or referee appointed them, their claim being that in fact they were appointed trustees at a meeting of creditors, whereas complainants allege that the pretended call by the referee for the meeting of creditors was issued at a time when there was no vacancy in the office of trustee; that ten days' notice of the meeting was not given by mail to all the creditors, as required by law; that the only creditor who attended the meeting was one Wills, a director of the company, and that there were ten other creditors who had proven claims; that Wills did \n\n[234 U.S. 712, 717]\n\u00a0\n not own a bona fide provable claim to the amount of one half of the claims that had been proven; and that the appointment of defendants as trustees was made by Wills alone. Complainants insist that there was no power or jurisdiction in any creditor or creditors to appoint defendants as trustees on March 12, 1909, because at that time there was no vacancy in the office of trustee, since Burr had not then resigned and his resignation had not been accepted by the court. The bill further avers that in their answer to the supplemental bill in the equity suit in the circuit court of Polk county, Florida, the present complainants set up the defense of 'want of jurisdiction of the said court of bankruptcy to render any decree of adjudication, and that such alleged decree was void on the face of the said proceedings;' that this part of the answer was excepted to and the exceptions sustained by the order of the Polk county circuit court; that on appeal, the Florida supreme court affirmed this order on July 3, 1912, ruling that all such defendses were collateral attacks upon the bankruptcy proceedings, which were not permissible, the ruling being expressed in the following words: 'The assaults made upon the bankruptcy proceedings in the Federal court of Massachusetts by the answer of the appellants to the supplemental bill of the appellees in the particulars wherein said answer was excepted to by the appellees is simply a collateral attack upon the judgments, orders, and proceedings in said bankruptcy court that is not permissible either by way of defense to the supplemental bill or to the original bill as amended;' that by reason of the said judgment of the Florida courts the present complainants cannot, by way of defense to the bills of complaint in those courts, 'have and obtain that speedy, adequate, and appropriate relief that this court is competent to render upon this original bill of complaint; and your orators fear that the Florida courts will decline to adjudicate as to the character \n\n[234 U.S. 712, 718]\n\u00a0\n and title of the defendants as trustees and their competency to attack your orators' title to said properties, as herein set forth, upon any answer to the said bills in the said state court.' The present amended bill further sets up that 'upon the facts hereinbefore set forth, which are conclusively provable to be true by the record of the proceedings of the said court of bankruptcy, if the said Port Tampa Company had any title to any of the aforesaid properties, legal or equitable, at the time of the said alleged decree of adjudication, such title still remains in the said company; that your orators are still liable to be sued by the said company in any court of competent jurisdiction to assert such title, and that a final decree in the Florida state court for or against the defendants as such alleged trustees would not be pleadable in bar of a suit by the said company against your orators to assert such title.' The specific prayer is for a decree to restrain defendants 'from asserting or claiming as trustees in bankruptcy, in any court or place, any right, title, or interest in or to any of the properties herein described until the further decree of this court.' There is also a prayer for general relief. Appended as exhibits and made a part of the bill are the copies of the petition, supoena, return, and appearance in the bankruptcy proceedings, already mentioned, and a transcript of the record of the ejectment suit in the United States circuit court for the southern district of Florida.\n The district court, in sustaining the demurrer, held that since upon the face of the bankruptcy proceedings there was no want of jurisdiction over the parties or the subject-matter, and the decree was not void in form, it could not be collaterally attacked, and could be assailed only by a direct proceeding in a competent court; citing New Lamp Chimney Co. v. Ansonia Brass & Copper Co. \n91 \nU.S. 656, 662\n, 23 S. L. ed. 336, 339; Graham v. Boston, H. & E. R. Co. \n118 \nU.S. 161, 178\n, 30 S. L. ed. 196, 204, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1009. Treating the present suit as a direct at- \n\n[234 U.S. 712, 719]\n\u00a0\n tack, the court held, first, that no right or interest of complainants appeared to be so prejudiced by the adjudication in bankruptcy as to entitle them to equitable relief against it; that the adjudication concerned only the bankrupt and its creditors, since it made no difference to complainants whether the claim to the Florida properties was asserted by the bankrupt itself or by its trustees; that the allegation that a final decree in the Florida suit would not bar an action brought by the company itself was a mere conclusion of law, not admitted by the demurrer, and an unsound conclusion in view of the facts alleged; that, the adjudication not having been questioned by the bankrupt or its creditors, they were bound by it, and by virtue of it the trustees were in the bankrupt's place so far as concerned any claim that it could assert to the Florida properties. And, secondly, that there was a defect of necessary parties, because the only defendants named in the bill were the bankruptcy trustees, respecting whom it was not alleged that they were parties to the bankruptcy proceedings, nor that they participated in the fraud whereby the adjudication was alleged to have been procured.\n The circuit court of appeals, while agreeing with this reasoning, placed its decision upon the ground that complainants were invoking not the powers of the district court in bankruptcy, but its general powers as a court in equity; that it also appeared that the proceedings in Florida were instituted by a bill in equity with the parties reversed; that the Florida court was a chancery court and a court of superior jurisdiction in equity, and for present purposes of equal dignity and authority with the district court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts; that the bill in substance merely invoked the general equitable jurisdiction of the district court in order to restrain proceedings in a state court proceeding in equity in a prior suit between the same parties; and that this ran \n\n[234 U.S. 712, 720]\n\u00a0\n counter to  720, Rev. Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 581 ( 265, Judicial Code, 36 Stat. at L. 1162, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 236), as well as to the general principle that the authority of the court first acquiring jurisdiction, the parties being the same, must prevail; citing Marshall v. Holmes, \n141 \nU.S. 589, 596\n, 35 S. L. ed. 870, 872, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 62, and Central Nat. Bank v. Stevens, \n169 \nU.S. 432, 462\n, 42 S. L. ed. 807, 818, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 403.\n There is a motion to dismiss the appeal, based upon the ground that the jurisdiction of the district court depended solely upon diversity of citizenship, and that therefore the decree of the circuit court of appeals is final, under  128, Judicial Code (36 Stat. at L. 1133, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 193). The motion must be granted unless the suit was one arising under the laws of the United States, within the meaning of the first subdivision of  24 of the Code. The rule is firmly established that a suit does not so arise unless it really and substantially involves a dispute or controversy respecting the validity, construction, or effect of some law of the United States, upon the determination of which the result depends. And this must appear not by mere inference, but by distinct averments according to the rules of good pleading; not that matters of law must be pleaded as such, but that the essential facts averred must show, not as a matter of mere inference or argument, but clearly and distinctly, that the suit arises under some Federal law.

Rep. 182), because complainants have not planted themselves upon that ground.\n Complainants are not parties to the proceeding in bankruptcy, and are setting up rights in opposition to the adjudication and the appointment of trustees therein. They seek to have the trustees restrained from prosecuting the equity suit against them in the state court of Florida, and to that end undertake to show (a) that the bankruptcy proceedings were void for want of jurisdiction; (b) that the entire proceedings were a fraud upon the bankrupt act; and (c) that, even if the proceedings were valid, the appointment of the trustees was void. This is the theory of the bill of complaint, and it is by this that the right of ultimate appeal to this court is to be tested, rather than by the grounds upon which the district court and the circuit court of appeals reached conclusions adverse to the relief prayed. Were the views adopted by those courts found to be untenable, it would be necessary to pass upon the attack made by complainants upon the title of the trustees in bankruptcy; and to do this would require us to determine the construction and effect of those provisions of the bankruptcy act that bear upon the matters of fact averred as the basis of the attack. We deem, therefore, that the suit is one arising under the laws of the United States, within the meaning of \n\n[234 U.S. 712, 722]\n\u00a0\n  24, Judicial Code, and the motion to dismiss will be denied.\n Upon the merits, we find it unnecessary to consider the views expressed by the district court, since it seems to us that the view of the circuit court of appeals as to the effect of  720, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 581), is correct, and is sufficient to dispose of the case.\n The substance of the matter is that complainants allege that they are the owners of certain property in Florida in which defendants, as trustees in bankruptcy of the Port Tampa Company, assert an equitable claim or interest, to establish which they are prosecuting or attempting to prosecute an equitable action in a Florida state court against complainants. The latter aver that because of fraud, or for other reasons, the proceedings and adjudication in bankruptcy and the appointment of defendants as trustees are invalid, and that for this reason any decree that may be made by the Florida state court will not be binding upon the Port Tampa Company. As already mentioned, the specific prayer is that defendants may be restrained from asserting or claiming as trustees in bankruptcy, in any court or place, any right, title, or interest in the property. There is a prayer for general relief, but it was pointed out by the circuit court of appeals (207 Fed. 534, 544) that no right to relief other than by way of an injunction was brought to the attention of the district court or of the court of appeals upon the hearing. The general prayer should therefore be treated as abandoned.\n So far as the action already pending in the Florida court of equity is concerned, the case is clearly within  720, Rev. Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 581, ( 265, Judicial Code, 36 Stat. at L. 1162, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 236): 'The writ of injunction shall not be granted by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in any court of a state, except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bank- \n\n[234 U.S. 712, 723]\n\u00a0\n ruptcy.' The latter clause formerly had reference to  5106, Rev. Stat. ( 21 of the bankruptcy act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. at L. 526 chap. 176); in the place of which we now have  11 and subdivision 7 and 15 of  2 of the bankruptcy act of July 1, 1898 (30 Stat. at L. 546, 549, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3421, 3426). It is quite evident that the injunction sought by the present complainants is not one authorized by the bankruptcy act.\n The prohibition against injunctions to stay proceedings in state courts originated in the act of March 2, 1793 (chap. 22,  5, 1 Stat. at L. 335), and has been constantly observed by the courts. See Diggs v. Wolcott, 4 Cranch, 179, 2 L. ed. 587; Peck v. Jenness, 7 How. 612, 625, 12 L. ed. 841, 846; Watson v. Jones, 13 Wall. 679, 719, 20 L. ed. 666, 672; Haines v. Carpenter, \n91 \nU.S. 254, 257\n, 23 S. L. ed. 345, 346; Dial v. Reynolds, \n96 U.S. 340\n, 24 L. ed. 644; Chapman v. Brewer, \n114 \nU.S. 158, 172\n, 29 S. L. ed. 83, 88, 5 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 67.\n It is recognized, however, that  720 was not intended to limit the power of the Federal courts to enforce their authority in cases that, on other grounds, are within their proper jurisdiction; and hence, it has been held that, in aid of its jurisdiction properly acquired, and in order to render its judgments and decrees effectual, a Federal court may restrain proceedings in a state court which would have the effect of defeating or impairing such jurisdiction.

Rep. 251.\n The contention that the present case falls within this exception to the general application of  720, because the bill is really filed in aid of the judgment of a Federal court, that is to say, the judgment in favor of Hull in the ejectment suit in the circuit court of the United States for \n\n[234 U.S. 712, 724]\n\u00a0\n the southern district of Florida, will not bear analysis. The ejectment suit was commenced after the adjudication of bankruptcy, and the bill does not aver that the judgment cut off the equitable rights of the Port Tampa Company, but, on the contrary, declares that if that company had any title to the property, legal or equitable, at the time of the adjudication of bankruptcy, such title still remains in the company. It is not averred that the claim of equitable right on the part of the company is inconsistent with the judgment, or should be subordinated to it. The present trustees, or either of them, were not made parties to the ejectment suit, nor is the company made a party to the present action. And, upon the whole, it seems to us that by no interpretation or construction can the present bill be deemed to have been filed in aid of the judgment in ejectment, or be sustained upon that theory.\n It is argued that the bill cannot be deemed to have as its object the staying of a pending suit in the state court, because that action abated upon Burr's resignation as trustee, and no further proceeding can be had until his successors have been made parties. To this point a decision of the Florida supreme court in the very action is cited (Hull v. Burr, 62 Fla. 499, 56 So. 673). We do not interpret this decision as sustaining the contention, and in a subsequent stage of the same litigation (64 Fla. 83, 59 So. 787), the court distinctly held that the action did not abate on the resignation of Burr, but might be proceeded with by his successors when appointed, the same as if originally instituted by them; and that a supplemental bill was the proper procedure to have such successors formally brought into the case as parties. Indeed, it is only upon the theory that defendants are prosecuting that suit that the complainants show ground for an injunction against them.\n To the suggestion that the term 'any court,' in the bill of complaint, may include other Federal courts, it is \n\n[234 U.S. 712, 725]\n\u00a0\n sufficient to say that the bill is devoid of any showing that defendants are asserting claims against complainants' title in any court other than the Florida state court. Hence, there is no occasion to invoke the general rule that the court first obtaining jurisdiction of a controversy should be permitted to proceed without interference. Peck v. Jenness, 7 How. 612, 624, 12 L. ed. 841, 846; Central Nat. Bank v. Stevens, \n169 \nU.S. 432, 459\n, 42 S., L. ed. 807, 817, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 403; Bigelow v.

S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1322), against a railroad \n\n[233 U.S. 473, 476]\n\u00a0\n company, by a personal representative to recover for the death of his intestate, the plaintiff prevailed, and the defendant took the case by writ of error to the circuit court of appeals. That court, desiring instruction upon a question of law arising in the case, certified the question here under  239 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 228]. The facts shown in the certificate are these: The intestate was in the service of the railroad company as a member of a crew attached to a switch engine operated exclusively within the city of New Orleans. He was the fireman, and came to his death, while at his post of duty, through a head-on collision. The general work of the crew consisted in moving cars from one point to another within the city over the company's tracks and other connecting tracks. Sometimes the cars were loaded, at other times empty, and at still other times some were loaded and others empty. When loaded the freight in them was at times destined from within to without the state or vice versa; at other times was moving only between points within the state, and at still other times was of both classes. When the cars were empty the purpose was usually to take them where they were to be loaded or away from where they had been unloaded. And oftentimes, following the movement of cars, loaded or empty, to a given point, other cars were gathered up and taken or started elsewhere. In short, the crew handled interstate and intrastate traffic indiscriminately, frequently moving both at once and at times turning directly from one to the other. At the time of the collision the crew was moving several cars loaded with freight which was wholly intrastate, and upon completing that movement was to have gathered up and taken to other points several other cars as a step or link in their transportation to various destinations within and without the state. The question of law upon which the circuit court of appeals desires instruction is whether, upon these facts, it can be said that the intestate, at the time of his fatal injury, was employed in \n\n[233 U.S. 473, 477]\n\u00a0\n interstate commerce within the meaning of the employers' liability act.\n Considering the status of the railroad as a highway for both interstate and intrastate commerce, the interdependence of the two classes of traffic in point of movement and safety, the practical difficulty in separating or dividing the general work of the switching crew, and the nature and extent of the power confided to Congress by the commerce clause of the Constitution, we entertain no doubt that the liability of the carrier for injuries suffered by a member of the crew in the course of its general work was subject to regulation by Congress, whether the particular service being performed at the time of the injury, isolatedly considered, was in interstate or intrastate commerce.

Co.) \n207 U.S. 463\n, 52 L. ed. 297, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 141, is not to the contrary, for the act of June 11, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 232, chap. 3073, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1316), there pronounced invalid, attempted to regulate the liability of every carrier in interstate commerce, whether by railroad or otherwise, for any injury to any employee, even though his employment had no connection whatever with interstate commerce.\n Passing from the question of power to that of its exercise, we find that the controlling provision in the act of April 22, 1908, reads as follows: 'That every common carrier by railroad while engaging in commerce between any of the several states . . . shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce, or, in case of the death of such employee, to his or her personal representative, . . . for such injury or death resulting \n\n[233 U.S. 473, 478]\n\u00a0\n in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier, or by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, works, boats, wharves, or other equipment.' Giving to the words 'suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce' their natural meaning, as we think must be done, it is clear that Congress intended to confine its action to injuries occurring when the particular service in which the employee is engaged is a part of interstate commerce. The act was so construed in Pedersen v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. \n229 U.S. 146\n, 57 L. ed. 1125, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648, 3 N. C. C. A. 779. It was there said (p. 150): 'There can be no doubt that a right of recovery thereunder arises only where the injury is suffered while the carrier is engaged in interstate commerce and while the employee is employed by the carrier in such commerce.' Again (p. 152): 'The true test always is: Is the work in question a part of the interstate commerce in which the carrier is engaged?' And a like view is shown in other cases. Second Employers' Liability Cases (Mondou v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co.) \n223 U.S. 1\n, 56 L. ed. 327, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 44, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 169, 1 N. C. C. A. 875: Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v.

Rep. 581.\n Here, at the time of the fatal injury the intestate was engaged in moving several cars, all loaded with intrastate freight, from one part of the city to another. That was not a service in interstate commerce, and so the injury and resulting death were not within the statute. That he was expected, upon the completion of that task, to engage in another which would have been a part of interstate commerce, is immaterial under the statute, for by its terms the true test is the nature of the work being done at the time of the injury.\n The question is accordingly answered in the negative. \n\n\n\n","95":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE CITY OF LOUISVILLE(1914)\nNo. 11\nArgued: November 10, 1913Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. Pendleton Beckley, J. W. S. Clements, and Stuart Chevalier for petitioner.\n\n\n[231 U.S. 639, 641]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alexander Pope Humphrey, William L. Granbery, and Hunt Chipley for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Petition for a rule on the judge of the district court of the United States for the western district of Kentucky \n\n[231 U.S. 639, 642]\n\u00a0\n to show cause why a mandamus should not issue commanding him to vacate the supplemental order of reference entered on March 10, 1913, in the cause entitled Cumberland Teleph. & Teleg. Co. v. Louisville, pending in said district court, and to desist from further trying in the cause the question whether the ordinance of March 6, 1909, in litigation in the cause, is confiscatory and void as to the company, and further commanding him to dismiss the bill of complaint, retaining the same on the docket, however, for the purpose of ascertaining the amounts collected by the company from its patrons in the city of Louisville in excess of the rates prescribed in the ordinance, and for the further purpose of distributing the same among the persons entitled thereto.\n A rule was issued in accordance with the petitioner, and return thereon duly made by the district judge.\n The suit referred to was brought by the Telephone & Telegraph Company against the city in the circuit court, the predecessor of the district court, on the 8th of March, 1909, and sought an injunction enjoining the city of Louisville from enforcing the ordinance referred to on the ground that the rates prescribed by it were confiscatory. Upon the filing of the bill a temporary restraining order was granted. A motion was also made for an injunction pendente lite, but was not passed upon till final hearing on the 25th of April, 1911, when a permanent injunction was decreed, the court adjudging the rates fixed to be confiscatory.\n On the 15th of June, 1909, the city moved for an order requiring the company to pay into court all sums collected in excess of those fixed in the ordinance. Thereupon the company agreed that if the court make no order in pursuance of the motion, it would keep an accurate account of the sums collected in excess of the rates fixed in the ordinance, and would, on the final hearing, pay the amounts into court for distribution among those entitled thereto, \n\n[231 U.S. 639, 643]\n\u00a0\n provided the ordinance was not declared to be confiscatory. In pursuance of the agreement the court refrained from making the order prayed for, and allowed the restraining order to remain in force.\n An appeal to this court was taken by the city from the decree of perpetual injunction, and the decree was reversed. \n225 U.S. 430\n, 56 L. ed. 1151, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 741. This court reviewed the evidence upon which the circuit court decided that the rates were confiscatory, and said:\n'We express no opinion whether to cut this telephone company down to 6 per cent by legislation would or would not be confiscatory. But when it is remembered what clear evidence the court requires before it declares legislation otherwise valid void on this ground, and when it is considered how speculative every figure is that we have set down with delusive exactness, we are of opinion that the result is too near the dividing line not to make actual experiment necessary. The master thought that the probable net income for the year that would suffer the greatest decrease would be 8.60 per cent on the values estimated by him. The judge, on assumptions to which we have stated our disagreement, makes the present earnings 5-10.17 per cent, with a reduction by the ordinance to 3-6.17 per cent. The whole question is too much in the air for us to feel authorized to let the injunction stand.\n\n'Decree reversed without prejudice.'\n\n A mandate was issued, the material parts of which are as follows:\n'On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this court that the decree of the siad circuit court in this cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed with costs, without prejudice; and that the said defendant, city of Louisville, recover against the said complainant, $3,945.65, for its costs herein expended, and have execution therefor. \n\n[231 U.S. 639, 644]\n\u00a0\n 'And it is further ordered that this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the district court of the United States for the western district of Kentucky for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this court.'\n\n On the return of the case to the district court, as successor of the circuit court, in obedience to the mandate, the original decree was set aside and the case restored to the docket. Subsequently, on motion of the city, the court appointed a special master to take proof of and report the amount, with interest, collected by the company in excess of the rates fixed by the ordinance. Power was given to the master to subpoena witnesses and examine the books and records of the company. A motion of the city to require the company to pay the amount into the court was postponed. A motion of A. Englehard & Sons Company for leave to file a bill of intervention was set for hearing November 12, 1912. The master proceeded to the execution of his duties under the order, but had not completed them at the time the petition herein was filed. The sums in excess of the rate will aggregate more than $100,000.\n On March 10, 1913, the district court (it is alleged, without any motion being made or any further steps taken by any party to the cause, on its own initiative, entered a supplemental order of reference wherein the clerk of the court was appointed a special master to ascertain and report the gross earnings of the company after the rate ordinance went into effect, the gross expenses incurred in operating its property, and the net income derived by the company from operating its plant since the ordinance was put into effect.\n The court justified this order by its interpretation of the opinion and mandate of this court. The city protested against the entry of the order, denying that it was a proper interpretation of the opinion of this court, and insisted \n\n[231 U.S. 639, 645]\n\u00a0\n that the district court, in response to the bill of complaint, should 'adjudge that the ordinance in question was not confiscatory, and that the complainant take nothing by its bill.' And it is now alleged that the cause is at an end so far as the rights of the company to have the ordinance adjudged confiscatory and void are concerned, and that the district court has no further jurisdiction; that the trial of the issue cost the city $20,000, and a new trial will cost it the same sum, and that no appeal can be taken until such trial be had; and, having no adequate remedy but mandamus, the petitioner prays that one issue to require the judge to vacate his order and to desist from further trying the issue.\n It is alleged that the special master, who was appointed to ascertain the amounts collected by the company, is ready to make his report, and will make it in a short time.\n It is further alleged the amounts collected in excess of the ordinance are a trust fund held by it for the benefit of the patrons of the company as their rights may appear, and that they are entitled to have restitution made to them by the district court, and that therefore the litigation between the company and the city should not be dismissed absolutely, but should be retained on the docket for the purpose of having collected and distributed the excessive collections. And this relief is prayed in addition to the mandamus.\n Due return to the rule was made. It is, in effect, that the court considered the opinion and decree of this court permitted a discretion to retain the case for an actual experiment of the rates, and, thus considering it, made the order of March 10, 1913\n\n\n We think the discretion was properly exercised. The terms of the mandate permitted further proceedings, and it is well to recall what had been done. The decree of this court was rendered June 7, 1912. The Telephone Company put the ordinance rates into effect July 1, 1912. \n\n[231 U.S. 639, 646]\n\u00a0\n On motion of the city a special master was appointed to take proof and report the amount collected by the company between the latter date and March 8, 1909, and subsequently, after an interchange of views between court and counsel, the order of March 10, 1913, was made. It will be observed, therefore, that an actual experiment of the rates had been voluntarily undertaken and had been in effect for more than eight months before the order under review was entered, and the court conceived that observation of the experiment might secure greater accuracy and confidence in the result, and, besides, inform the court of matters as they progressed.\n We repeat, we think the court did not exceed the discretion permitted, and the rule is discharged. \n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE ENGELHARD & SONS CO(1914)\nNo. 12\nArgued: November 10, 1913Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[231 U.S. 646, 647]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Clayton B. Blakey and Huston Quin for petitioner.\n Messrs. Alexander Pope Humphrey, William L. Granbery, and Hunt Chipley for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n This petition was argued and submitted with No. 11, Original [\n231 U.S. 639\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 255], and prays a mandamus issue commanding respondent to vacate the order made March 10, 1913, in the suit then and now pending, brought by the Cumberland Telephone & Telegraph Company against the city of Louisville, in so far as it denied to petitioner the right to sue for all subscribers of the Telephone & Telegraph Company similarly situated with petitioner, who paid the Telephone & Telegraph Company, during the pendency of the injunction against a certain rate ordinance enacted \n\n[231 U.S. 646, 648]\n\u00a0\n by the city, sums in excess of the rates fixed in the ordinance, and commanding him to enter an order permitting petitioner to sue for and represent and act in behalf of such subscribers with respect to the restitution of the sums so collected.\n If this cannot be done, then petitioner prays for a rule on said judge to show cause why a mandamus shall not issue to grant petitioner an appeal prayed for from the order of March 10, 1913, and refused by him.\n The petition recites the proceedings in the district court substantially as they are recited in the petition in Re Louisville. It adds these details: That while the injunction was in force at least 8,000 of the subscribers of the Telephone Company paid for its service sums in excess of the amounts fixed by the ordinance; that the amounts paid by them ranged from $5 to $100, the majority of the payments being less than $ 20. The total amount so paid will exceed $100,000. None of the subscribers were parties to the litigation, and petitioner, on September 28, 1912, presented and asked to have filed a bill of intervention in the cause, and that it might be permitted to sue for and represent all of the subscribers who had so paid the Telephone Company. The petition was refused.\n That on February 15, 1913, and after the new equity rules had been promulgated by this court, petitioner again moved for leave to file its bill of intervention and for leave to sue in behalf of all of such subscribers. The motion was denied.\n A petition for an appeal was presented and denied on April 18, 1913\n\n\n That during the time the Telephone Company collected rates from its subscribers in excess of the new ordinance rates, some of the subscribers had business telephones on a direct line, and some on a party line; some had residence telephones on a direct line and others on a party line. All \n\n[231 U.S. 646, 649]\n\u00a0\n of the subscribers who paid the excess rates paid them under identically similar circumstances, and in the same situation with respect to their right to heve the Telephone Company restore the excess. The petitioner had a telephone on a party line and more than 3,000 of the subscribers of the company had the same kind of telephone.\n That the effect of the order of the court is to deny the right of the subscribers to be represented in the cause upon the correctness of the master's report, which will be filed in the next thirty days, and their rights will be finally adjudicated without allowing them to appear or have their day in court. There are 8,000 subscribers thus situated who have no adequate remedy against the action of the court, but mandamus.\n A copy of the complaint in intervention is attached to the petition. It sets out the facts as in the petition, but more in detail, with additions in an attempt to show a common interest in all of the subscribers to the right of petitioner to appear for itself and for them. It prays that petitioner be made a party to the cause for itself and the other subscribers; that the Telephone Company, upon the coming in of the master's report, pay into the court the sums collected in excess of the ordinance rates, with interest at 6 per cent to be distributed for the benefit of those concerned. The bill of intervention was permitted to be filed so far as to permit petitioner to assert its own claim, but so far as it prayed to be permitted to act or claim for any other but itself, its prayer was denied, with the privilege, however, to renew the same upon making it appear to the court that it had authority from 'other specifically named claimants' to act for them.\n The basis of petitioner's contention is that it has a common interest with the other subscribers of the Telephone Company, and may therefore intervene for itself \n\n[231 U.S. 646, 650]\n\u00a0\n and for them. Equity rule 38 is cited to sustain the contention. Petitioner is not seeking, however, as it says, 'for itself or for anyone the recovery of a specific portion of the fund.' The alternative of this would seem to be the assertion of a right to intervene and become a party to all the controversies upon which the fund may depend, and this may mean either in conjunction with the city or independently of it, and, it may be, in exclusion of it. It is said that the city is acting only for the good of the public, but that that is not 'the criterion to determine whether the parties in interest have the representation to which they are entitled.' It is further said that however earnest the city may be to obtain restitution to the subscribers of the Telephone Company, it might not appeal from an adverse ruling. Who is going to represent the subscribers, it is asked, upon the question of fees to the master and the costs, and the costs on appeal, and who raise the question of interest? This enumeration presents the purpose of the petition for intervention. In other words, the apprehension is expressed and made a basis of the petition for leave to intervene, that the city, which has so far conducted the litigation-and with success-may or will relax its attention and energy to the detriment of petitioner and the other subscribers of the company. This does not present a very strong plea against the discretion the court exercised, supposing the court had discretion to grant or refuse the petition.\n It is contended, however, that the court had no discretion but to grant the petition, and that equity rule 38 was peremptory of the right of petitioner. It recognizes the principle, it is said, 'that the rights of persons should not be passed upon unless such persons are before the court, or are represented by someone who is interested similarly \n\n[231 U.S. 646, 651]\n\u00a0\n with them.' And cases are cited which, it is urged, also recognize and illustrate the principle.\n We have given due consideration to the cited cases and the argument of counsel, and we are of opinion that the district court did not exceed its discretion in making the order under review. The city was the proper party to make defendant in the suit as representative of all interested, and so throughout the whole proceedings. If we may suppose in a case like the present one there can be a distinction between the public interest and private interest, the subscribers of the company being the public, the representation of both interests was adequately fulfilled. It was in consequence of the motion of the city that the telephone company agreed to keep account of charges in excess of the ordinance rates, and, if they should finally be decided to be illegal, to pay into court the excess sums for distribution among its subscribers. It was the representative of all interests to provide for the creation of the fund; it is properly the representative of all interests to see to its proper distribution. This is a necessary deduction from the cases. It is the universal practice, sustained by authority, that the only mode of judicial relief against unreasonable rates is by suit against the governmental authority which established them or is charged with the duty of enforcing them. As was said by Mr. Justice Miller, in Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n134 \nU.S. 418, 460\n, 33 S. L. ed. 970, 982, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 209, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 702, it was not competent for each individual having dealings with the regulated company 'to raise a contest in the courts over the questions which ought to be settled in this general and conclusive way.' The rule has been repeated in subsequent cases.\n Indeed, what issue is involved except that of the main suit-the character of the rates-that needs the intervention of petitioner? As to who are subscribers of the company, there can be no controversy, nor as to the amounts to be returned to them. Both names and amounts could be, \n\n[231 U.S. 646, 652]\n\u00a0\n indeed had been, ascertained by the master, under an order made upon motion of the city. Petitioner, however, was not able to produce authority from any subscriber to appear for him, notwithstanding the order of respondent permitted petitioner to renew its motion whenever it should 'be made to appear to the court in any appropriate way that other specifically named claimants' desired petitioner to act for them. And yet, against these facts, against, as counsel for respondent says, the possibility of a presumption that the other subscribers of the telephone company do not desire petitioner to represent them, it prays a mandamus to compel such representation.\n We cannot yield to the prayer.\n Rule discharged. \n\n\n\n","97":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERNATIONAL HARVESTER CO.

Com. of Kentucky \n234 U.S. 216\n (1914) ]\n\n\n[234 U.S. 216, 218]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James Garnett, Attorney General of Kentucky, and Messrs. Charles Carroll, Frank Ed. Daugherty, J. Robert Layman, and J. R. Mallory for defendant in error.\n\n\n[234 U.S. 216, 219]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error was prosecuted, convicted, and fined in three different counties for having entered into an agreement with other named companies for the purpose of controlling the price of harvesters, etc., manufactured by them, and of enhancing it above their real value; and for having so fixed and enhanced the price, and for having sold their harvesters, etc., at a price in excess of their real value, in pursuance of the agreement alleged. The judgments were affirmed by the court of appeals. 147 Ky. 564, 144 S. W. 1064, Id. 144 Ky. 795, 146 S. W. 12, 148 Ky. 572, 147 S. W. 1199. The plaintiff in error saved its rights under the 14th Amendment and brought the cases here.\n The law of Kentucky in its present form is the result of the construction of several statutes somewhat far apart in time and of seemingly contradictory import. It was argued that construction could not take the place of express language in a statute, and Louisville & N. \n\n[234 U.S. 216, 220]\n\u00a0\n R. Co. v. Central Stock Yards Co. \n212 \nU.S. 132, 144\n, 53 S. L. ed. 441, 446, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 246, was cited for the proposition. But the case gives no sanction to it. The point there was that a defect in a law could not be cured by precautions in a judgment; not that what seemed a defect could not be cured by the construction given to the words by the court having final authority to declare their intent. We follow the Kentucky court of appeals in taking what they derive from the legislation of the state as if it were embodied in a single act.\n The history in brief is this: By an act of May 20, 1890, agreements for the purpose of fixing or limiting the amount or quantity of any article of merchandise to be produced or manufactured, mined, bought, or sold; as also combinations by corporations with others to put the business of the combination under control with intent to limit, fix, or change the price of articles of commerce, or in any way to diminish the output of such articles, were made punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both. Carroll's Stat. (Ky.)  3915-3917. In 1891 a new Constitution was adopted by the state, by  198 of which it was made the duty of the general assembly 'from time to time, as necessity may require, to enact such laws as may be necessary to prevent all trusts . . . from combining to depreciate below its real value any article, or to enhance the cost of any article above its real value.' (This was held not to repeal the earlier statute. Com. v. International Harvester Co. 131 Ky. 551, 566, 133 Am. St. Rep. 256, 115 S. W. 703. But Kentucy grows tobacco, and the farmers were dissatisfied with the prices that they were able to get, being oppressed, as they alleged, by a combination of buyers. So, on March 21, 1906, a statute was enacted that made it lawful for any number of persons to combine the crops of wheat, tobacco, corn, oats, hay, or other farm products raised by them, for the purpose of obtaining a higher price than they could get by selling them separately. Session Laws 1906, chap. 117, p. 429. And later, by an act of \n\n[234 U.S. 216, 221]\n\u00a0\n March 13, 1908, not only was the legality of these last-mentioned combinations reaffirmed, but they were protected by injunction, and the sale by or purchase from the owner contrary to his agreement was punished by a fine.\n When the court of appeals came to deal with the act of 1890, the Constitution of 1891, and the act of 1906, it reached the conclusion, which now may be regarded as the established construction of the three, taken together, that by interaction and to avoid questions of constitutionality, they were to be taken to make any combination for the purpose of controlling prices lawful unless for the purpose or with the effect of fixing a price that was greater or less than the real value of the article. Owen County Burley Tobacco Soc. v. Brumback, 128 Ky. 137, 151, 10m S. W. 710; Com. v. International Harvester Co. 131 Ky. 551, 568, 571- 573, 133 Am. St. Rep. 256, 115 S. W. 703; International Harvester Co. v. Com. 137 Ky. 668, 126 S. W. 352. The result seems to be that combinations of tobacco growers are held to do no more than restore an equilibrium that has been disturbed by a combination of buyers (Owne County Burley Tobacco Soc. v. Brumback, 128 Ky. 137, 152, 107 S. W. 710; Collins v. Com. 141 Ky. 564, 133 S. W. 233); whereas, if prices rise after a combination of manufacturers, it very nearly is presumed that the advance is avove the real value, and that there is a crime. International Harvester Co. v. Com. 144 Ky. 403, 410, 411, 138 S. W. 248.\n The plaintiff in error contends that the law as construed offers no standard of conduct that it is possible to know. To meet this, in the present and earlier cases the real value is declared to be 'the market value under fair competition, and under normal market conditions.' 147 Ky. 566. Com. v. International Harvester Co. 131 Ky. 551, 576, 133 Am. St. Rep. 256, 115 S. W. 703; International Harvester Co. v. Com. 137 \n\n[234 U.S. 216, 222]\n\u00a0\n Ky. 668, 677, 678, 126 S. W. 352. We have to consider whether, in application, this is more than an illusory form of words, when, nine years after it was incorporated, a combination invited by the law is required to guess at its peril what its product would have sold for if the combination had not existed and nothing else violently affecting values had occurred. It seems that since 1902 the price of the machinery sold by the plaintiff in error has risen from 10 to 15 per cent. The testimony on its behalf showed that meantime the cost of materials used had increased from 20 to 25 per cent and labor 27 1\/2 per cent. Whatever doubt there may be about the exact figures, we hardly suppose the fact of a rise to be denied. But, in order to each what is called the real value,-a price from which all effects of the combination are to be eliminated,-the plaintiff in error is told that it cannot avail itself of the rise in materials because it was able to get them cheaper through one of the subsidiary companies of the combination, and that the saving through the combination more than offset all the rise in cost.\n This perhaps more plainly concerns the justice of the law in its bearing upon the plaintiff in error, when compared with its operation upon tobacco raisers who are said to have doubled or trebled their prices, than on the constitutional question proposed. But it also concerns that, for it shows how impossible it is to think away the principal facts of the case as it exists, and say what would have been the price in an imaginary world. Value is the effect in exchange of the relative social desire for compared objects expressed in terms of a common denominator. It is a fact, and generally is more or less easy to ascertain. But what it would be with such increase of a never extinguished competition as it might be guessed would have existed had the combination not been made, with exclusion of the actual effect of other abnormal influences, and, it would seem, with exclusion also of any increased \n\n[234 U.S. 216, 223]\n\u00a0\n efficiency in the machines, but with inclusion of the effect of the combination so far as it was economically beneficial to itself and the community, is a problem that no human ingenuity could solve. The reason is not the general uncertainties of a jury trial, but that the elements necessary to determine the imaginary ideal are uncertain both in nature and degree of effect to the acutest commercial mind. The very community, the intensity of whose wish relatively to its other competing desires determines the price that it would give, has to be supposed differently organized and subject to other influences than those under which its acts. It is easy to put simple cases; but the one before us is at least as complex as we have supposed, and the law must be judged by it. In our opinion it cannot stand.\n We regard this decision as consistent with Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 377\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1232, 1235, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 780, in which it was held that a criminal law is not unconstitutional merely because it throws upon men the risk of rightly estimating a matter of degree,-what is an undue restraint of trade. That deals with the actual, not with an imaginary condition other than the facts. It goes no further than to recognize that, as with negligence, between the two extremes of the obviously illegal and the plainly lawful there is a gradual approach, and that the complexity of life makes it impossible to draw a line in advance without an artificial simplification that would be unjust. The conditions are as permanent as anything human, and a great body of precedents on the civil side, coupled with familiar practice, make it comparatively easy for common sense to keep to what is safe. But if business is to go on, men must unite to do it and must sell their wares. To compel them to guess, on peril of indictment, what the community would have given for them if the continually changing conditions were other than they are, to an uncertain extent; to divine prophetically what the reaction of only partially deter- \n\n[234 U.S. 216, 224]\n\u00a0\n minate facts would be upon the imaginations and desires of purchasers, is to exact gifts that mankind does not possess.\n Judgments reversed.\n Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice Pitney dissent. \n\n\n\n","98":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERNATIONAL HARVESTER CO. OF AMERICA v. COM. OF KENTUCKY(1914)\nNo. 297\nArgued: April 24, 1914Decided: June 22, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. Alexander Pope Humphrey, Edgar A. Bancroft, and Victor A. Remy for plaintiff in error.[ International Harvester Co. of America v. Com. of Kentucky \n234 U.S. 579\n (1914) ]\n\n\n[234 U.S. 579, 581]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles Carroll, Frank E. Daugherty, J. R. Mallory, J. C. Dedman, C. R. Hill, G. D. Florence, and Mr. James Garnett, Attorney General of Kentucky, for defendant in error.\n\n\n[234 U.S. 579, 582]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case presents the question of the sufficiency of the service of process on an alleged agent of the International Harvester Company in a criminal proceeding in Breckenridge county, Kentucky, in the court of which county an indictment had been returned against the Harvester Company for alleged violation of the antitrust laws of the state of Kentucky. The Harvester Company appeared and moved to quash the return, substantially upon the ground that service had not been made upon an authorized agent of the company, and that the company was not doing business within the state of Kentucky, and it set up that any action under the attempted service would violate the due process and commerce clauses of the Federal Constitution. The only question involved, says the court of appeals, and we find none other in the record, is whether there was such service of process as would sustain the judgment. The court overruled the motion, and, the case being called for trial and the Harvester Company failing to appear or plead, judgment by default for $500 penalty was entered against it, which was affirmed by the court of appeals of Kentucky (147 Ky. 655, 145 S. W. 393).\n It appeared that prior to Cotober 28, 1911, before this indictment was returned, the Harvester Company had \n\n[234 U.S. 579, 583]\n\u00a0\n been doing business in Kentucky, and had designated Louisville, Kentucky, as its principal place of business, in compliance with the statutes of Kentucky in that respect. It further appeared that the company had revoked the agency of one who had been appointed under the Kentucky statute, and had not appointed anyone else upon whom process might be served.\n It is conceded in the brief of the learned counsel for the plaintiff in error that whether the person upon whom process was served was one designated by the law of Kentucky as an agent to receive summons on behalf of the Harvester Company was a question within the province of the court of appeals of Kentucky to finally determine, and no review of that decision is asked here. We come, then, to the first question in this case, which is, Whether, under the circumstances shown in this case, the Harvester Company was carrying on business in the state of Kentucky in such manner as to justify the courts of that state in taking jurisdiction of complaints against it.\n For some purposes a corporation is deemed to be a resident of the state of its creation; but when a corporation of one state goes into another, in order to be regarded as within the latter it must be there by its agents authorized to transact its business in that state. The mere presence of an agent upon personal affairs does not carry the corporation into the foreign state. It has been frequently held by this court, and it can no longer be doubted, that it is essential to the rendition of a personal judgment that the corporation be 'doing business' within the state. St. Louis Southwestern R. Co. v. Alexander, \n227 \nU.S. 218, 226\n, 57 S. L. ed. 486, 488, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 245, and cases there cited. As was said in that case, each case must depend upon its own facts, and their consideration must show that this essential requirement of jurisdiction has been complied with, and that the corporation is actually doing business within the state.\n In the case now under consideration the court of ap- \n\n[234 U.S. 579, 584]\n\u00a0\n peals of Kentucky found, with warrant for the conclusion, that the Harvester Company's method of conducting business might be shown to the best advantage from the general instruction of the company to its agents, of date November 7, 1911, as follows:\n'The company's transactions hereafter with the people of Kentucky must be on a strictly interstate commerce basis. Travelers negotiating sales must not hereafter have any headquarters or place of business in that state, but may reside there.\n\n'Their authority must be limited to taking orders, and all orders must be taken subject to the approval of the general agent outside of the state, and all goods must be shipped from outside of the state after the orders have been approved. Travelers do not have authority to make a contract of any kind in the state of Kentucky. They merely take orders to be submitted to the general agent. If anyone in Kentucky owes the company a debt, they may receive the money, or a check, or a draft for the same, but they do not have any authority to make any allowance or compromise any disputed claims. When a matter cannot be settled by payment of the amount due, the matter must be submitted to the general collection agent, as the case may be, for adjustment, and he can give the order as to what allowance or what compromise may be accepted. All contracts of sale must be made f. o. b. from some point outside of Kentucky, and the goods become the property of the purchaser when they are delivered to the carrier outside of the state. Notes for the purchaser when may be taken, and they may be made payable at any bank in Kentucky. All contracts of any and every kind made with the people of Kentucky must be made outside of that state, and they will be contracts governed by the laws of the various states in which we have general agencies handling interstate business with the people of Kentucky. For example, contracts \n\n[234 U.S. 579, 585]\n\u00a0\n made by the general agent at Parkersburg, West Virginia, will be West Virginia contracts.\n\n'If any one of the company's general agents deviates from what is stated in this letter, the result will be just the same as if all of them had done so. Anything that is done that places the company in the position where it can be held as having done business in Kentucky will not only make the man transacting the business liable to a fine of from $100 to $1, 000 for each offense, but it will make the company liable for doing business in the state without complying with the requirements of the laws of the state. We will therefore depend upon you to see that these instructions are strictly carried out.'\n\n Taking this as the method of carrying on the affairs of the Harvester Company in Kentucky, does it show a doing of business within that state to the extent which will authorize the service of process upon its agents thus engaged?\n Upon this question the case is a close one, but upon the whole we agree with the conclusion reached by the court of appeals, that the Harvester Company was engaged in carrying on business in Kentucky. We place no stress upon the fact that the Harvester Company had previously been engaged in doing business in Kentucky, and had withdrawn from that state for reasons of its own. Its motives cannot affect the legal questions here involved. In order to hold it responsible under the process of the state court, it must appear that it was carrying on business within the state at the time of the attempted service. As we have said, we think it was. Here was a continuous course of business in the solicitation of orders which were sent to another state, and in response to which the machines of the Harvester Company were delivered within the state of Kentucky. This was a course of business, not a single transaction. The agents not only solicited such orders \n\n[234 U.S. 579, 586]\n\u00a0\n in Kentucky, but might there receive payment in money, checks, or drafts. They might take notes of customers, which notes were made payable, and doubtless were collected, at any bank in Kentucky. This course of conduct of authorized agents within the state in our judgment constituted a doing of business there in such wise that the Harvester Company might be fairly said to have been there, doing business, and amenable to the process of the courts of the state.\n It is argued that this conclusion is in direct conflict with the case of Green v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. \n205 U.S. 530\n, 51 L. ed. 916, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 595. We have no desire to depart from that decision which, however, was an extreme case. There the railway company, carrying on no business in Pennsylvania, other than that hereinafter mentioned, and having its organization and tracks in another state, was sought to be held liable in the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Pennsylvania by service upon one Heller, who was described as an agent of the corporation. As incidental and collateral to its business proper the company solicited freight and passenger traffic in other parts of the country than those through which its tracks ran. For that purpose it employed Heller, who had an office in Philadelphia, where he was known as district freight and passenger agent, to procure passengers and freight to be transported over the company's line. He had clerks and traveling passenger and freight agents who reported to him. He sold no tickets and received no payment for the transportation of freight, but took the money of those desiring to purchase tickets, and procured from one of the railroads running west from Philadelphia a ticket for Chicago and a prepaid order which gave the holder the right to receive from the company in Chicago a ticket over its road. Occasionally he sold to railroad employees, who already had tickets over intermediate lines, orders for reduced rates over the company's line. \n\n[234 U.S. 579, 587]\n\u00a0\n In some cases, for the convenience of shippers who had received bills of lading from the initial line for goods routed over the company's line, he exchanged bills of lading over its line, which were not in force until the freight had been actually received by the company. Summarizing these facts, Mr. Justice Moody, speaking for the court, said (p. 533):\n'The business shown in this case was in substance nothing more than that of solicitation. Without undertaking to formulate any general rule defining what transactions will constitute 'doing business' in the sense that liability to service is incurred, we think that this is not enough to bring the defendant within the district so that process can be served upon it.'\n\n In the case now under consideration there was something more than mere solicitation. In response to the orders received, there was a continuous course of shipment of machines into Kentucky. There was authority to receive payment in money, check, or draft, and to take notes payable at banks in Kentucky.\n It is further contended that, as enforced by the decision of the Kentucky court, the law, in its relation to interestate commerce, operates to burden that commerce. It is argued that a corporation engaged in purely interstate commerce within a state cannot be required to submit to regulations such as designating an agent upon whom process may be served as a condition of doing such business, and that as such requirement cannot be made, the ordinary agents of the corporation, although doing interstate business within the state, cannot by its laws be made amenable to judicial process within the state. The contention comes to this: so long as a foreign corporation engages in interstate commerce only, it is immune from the service of process under the laws of the state in which it is carrying on such business. This is indeed, as was said by the court of appeals of Kentucky, a novel proposition, and we are unable to \n\n[234 U.S. 579, 588]\n\u00a0\n find a decision to support it, nor has one been called to our attention.\n True, it has been held time and again that a state cannot burden interstate commerce or pass laws which amount to the regulation of such commerce; but this is a long way from holding that the ordinary process of the courts may not reach corporations carrying on business within the state which is wholly of an interstate commerce character. Such corporations are within the state, receiving the protection of its laws, and may, and often do, have large properties located within the state. In Davis v. Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. \n217 U.S. 157\n, 54 L. ed. 708, 27 L.R.A. (N. S.) 823, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 463, 18 Ann. Cas. 907, this court held that cars engaged in interstate commerce and credits due for interstate transportation are not immune from seizure under the laws of the state regulating garnishment and attachment because of their connection with interstate commerce, and it was recognized that the states may pass laws enforcing the rights of citizens which affect interstate commerce, but fall short of regulating such commerce in the sense in which the Constitution gives sole jurisdiction to Congress; citing Sherlock v. Alling, \n93 \nU.S. 99, 103\n, 23 S. L. ed. 819, 820; Johnson v. Chicago & P. Elevator Co. \n119 U.S. 388\n, 30 L. ed. 447, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 254; Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 23\n, 32 S. L. ed. 346, 351, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 232, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 6; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Hughes, \n191 U.S. 477\n, 48 L. ed. 268, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132; and The Winnebago, \n205 \nU.S. 354, 362\n, 51 S. L. ed. 836, 840, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 509, in which this court sustained a lien under the laws of Michigan on a vessel designed to be used in both foreign and domestic trade.\n In International Textbook Co. v. Pigg, \n217 U.S. 91\n, 54 L. ed. 678, 27 L.R.A.(N.S.) 493, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 481, 18 Ann. Cas. 1103, it is said, it was held that a law of Kansas which required the filing by a foreign corporation engaged in interstate commerce of a statement of its financial condition as a prerequisite of the right to do such business, and which required a certificate from the Secretary of state showing that such statements had been filed as a condition precedent to the right of the corporation to maintain a suit in that state, was void. But that case did not hold, as we should be \n\n[234 U.S. 579, 589]\n\u00a0\n required to do to sustain the contention of the plaintiff in error in this case, that the fact that the corporation was carrying on interstate commerce business through duly authorized agents made it exempt from suit within the state by service upon such agents.\n We are satisfied that the presence of a corporation within a state necessary to the service of process is shown when it appears that the corporation is there carrying on business in such sense as to manifest its presence within the state, although the business transacted may be entirely interstate in its character. In other words, this fact alone does not render the corporation immune from the ordinary process of the courts of the state.\n It follows that the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky must be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Leave granted on June 22, 1914, to present petition for rehearing within thirty days. \n\n\n\n\n","99":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERNATIONAL HARVESTER CO.

Prosser for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Information in the nature of quo warranto, brought in the supreme court of the state, to exclude plaintiff in error from the corporate rights, privileges, and franchises exer- \n\n[234 U.S. 199, 203]\n\u00a0\n cised or enjoyed by it under the laws of the state, that they be forfeited, and all or such portion of its property as the court may deem proper be confiscated, or, in lieu thereof, a fine be imposed upon it in 'punishment of the perversion, usurpation, abuse, and misuse of franchises.'\n The ground of the action is the alleged violation of the statutes of the state passed respectively in 1899 and 1909, and entitled 'Pools, Trusts, and Conspiracies,' and 'Pools, Trusts, and Conspiracies and Discriminations.'\n The facts alleged in the information are these: Plaintiff in error is a Wisconsin corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of agricultural implements, binders, mowers, etc., and was licensed on the 5th of April, 1892, to do business in Missouri under the name of the Milwaukee Harvester Company, and on September 18, 1902, became licensed to do and engaged in such business in the state. In that year in such business in the state. In that year New Jersey was organized with a capital stock of $120,000,000 for the purpose of effecting a combination of plaintiff in error and certain other companies to restrain competition in the manufacture and sale of such agricultural implements in Missouri, and the New Jersey company has maintained plaintiff in error as its sole selling agent in Missouri. Before the combination the companies combined were competitors of one another and of other corporations, individuals, and partnerships engaged in the same business in the state, and that thereby the people of the state, and particularly the retail dealers and farmers of the state, received the benefit of competition in the purchase and sale of farm implements. The combination was designed and made with a view to lessen, and it tended to lessen, free competition in such implements, and thereby the said corporations entered into and became members of a pool, trust, combination, and agreement. In furtherance thereof, and for the purpose of giving the International Harvester Company of New Jersey a \n\n[234 U.S. 199, 204]\n\u00a0\n monopoly of the business of manufacturing and selling agricultural implements in the state, and for the purpose of preventing competition in the sale thereof, plaintiff in error has compelled the retail dealers in each county of the state who desire to handle and sell or act as agent for it to refrain from selling implements manufactured or sold by competing companies or persons. By reason thereof competition in such implements has been restrained, prices controlled, the quantity of such implements has been fixed and limited, and plaintiff in error has been able to secure, and for several years enjoy, from 85 per cent to 90 per cent of the business, all to the great damage and loss of the people of the state, and by reason of its participation in the pool, trust, and combination, and by reason of the acts and things done by it, plaintiff in error has been guilty of an illegal, wilful, and malicious perversion and abuse of its franchises, privileges, and licenses granted to it by the state.\n The answer of plaintiff in error denied that it had become a party to any combination, or that, in its transactions, there was any purpose to restrain or lessen competition, or that trade had been or was restrained.\n The case was referred to a special commissioner to take the evidence and report his conclusions. He found, as alleged in the information, that the International Harvester Company of New Jersey was a combination of the properties and businesses of formerly competing harvester companies, and plaintiff in error being one of such companies, and thereafter, by selling the New Jersey company's products in Missouri, had violated the Missouri statutes against pools, trusts, and conspiracies.\n In exceptions to the report of the special commissioner plaintiff in error urged that the statute of Missouri violated the equality clause and due process clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, '(1) because said statute arbitrarily discrim- \n\n[234 U.S. 199, 205]\n\u00a0\n inates between persons making or selling products and commodities and persons selling labor and service of all kinds: In that each section of said statute applies only to articles of merchandise, and not to labor or services and the like, the prices of which are equally and similarly determined by competition, and may be equally and similarly the subject of combination and conspiracy to the detriment of the public. (2) Because said statute arbitrarily discriminates between the makers and sellers of products and commodities and the purchasers thereof: It prohibits manufacturers and sellers from making contracts or arrangements intended or tending to increase the market price of the articles they make or sell, but does not prohibit purchasers from combining to fix or reduce the market price of the commodities or articles to be purchased by them. (3) Because said statute, as construed by the commissioner, unreasonably and arbitrarily interferes with plaintiff in error's right to make proper and reasonable business contracts, and deprives it of property rights in respect thereto.'\n These exceptions were urged and argued in the supreme court upon the filing of the commissioner's report. Judgment was entered upon the report, in which it was adjudged that by reason of the violation of the statutes of the state, as charged in the information, plaintiff in error had forfeited the license theretofore granted to it to do business in the state, and it was adjudged that the license be forfeited and canceled and the company ousted from its rights and franchises granted by the state to do business in the state, and a fine of $50,000 was imposed upon it. It was, however, provided that upon payment of the fine on or before the 1st of January, 1912, and immediately ceasing all connection with the International Harvester Company of New Jersey and the corporations and copartnerships with which it had combined, and not continuing and maintaining the unlawful agreement and com- \n\n[234 U.S. 199, 206]\n\u00a0\n bination with them to lessen and destroy competition in the sale of the enumerated farm implements, and giving satisfactory evidence thereof to the court, the judgment of ouster should be suspended. The company was given until March 1, 1912, 'to file its proof of willingness' to comply with the judgment. It was also adjudged that upon a subsequent violation of the statute 'the suspension of the writ of ouster shall be removed' by the court 'and absolute ouster be enforced,' and to that end the court retained 'its full and complete jurisdiction over the cause.' 237 Mo. 369, 141 S. W. 672.\n A motion is made to dismiss on the ground that plaintiff in error in its answer simply denied that it had violated the antitrust laws of the state, and it is contended that by not alleging in its answer that those laws violated the Constitution of the United States, it waived such defense. It is further contended that because the Federal right was not asserted in the answer, the supreme court of the state could not have considered, and did not consider or decide it. Decisions of the supreme court of Missouri are cited to sustain the contentions. The decisions declare the proposition that constitutional questions must be raised at the first opportunity, or, as it is expressed in one of the cases (Brown v. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. 175 Mo. 185, 74 S. W. 973), 'the protection of the Constitution must be timely and properly invoked in the trial court.'\n In Dahnke-Walker Mill. Co. v. Blake, 242 Mo. 31, 145 S. W. 438, it is said: 'The rule of this court is that so grave a question [constitutional question] must be lodged at the first opportunity, or it will be deemed to have been waived. If it can be appropriately and naturally raised in the pleadings, and thereby be a question lodged in the record proper, such is the time and place to raise it;' and that it is too late to raise the question after judgment in a motion for new trial. In Hartzler v. Metropolitan Street R. Co. 218 Mo. 562, 117 S. W. 1124, it was held: 'The motion for a new trial was not \n\n[234 U.S. 199, 207]\n\u00a0\n the first door for the question to enter, and in our later decisions we have ruled that a question of such gravity must be raised as soon as orderly procedure will allow. This in order that the trial court may be treated fairly, and the question get into the case under correct safeguards, and earmarked as of substance, and not mere color.'\n It is manifest, we think, that the court only intended to express the condition of appellate review to be that in the trial court constitutional questions should not be reserved until the case had gone to judgment on other issues, and then used to secure a new trial. The principle of the rulings is satisfied in the case at bar. It is, as we have seen, an original proceeding in the supreme court, and upon the report of the commissioner which brought the case to the court for decision of the issues and questions involved in it the Federal questions were made 'under correct safeguards and earmarked as of substance, and not mere color.' It is true the court has not referred to them in its opinion, but we cannot regard its silence as a condemnation of the time or manner at or in which they were raised. The motion to dismiss is therefore denied.\n The assignments of error necessarily involve a consideration of the statutes. The relevant provisions are contained in  10,301 of the Revised Statutes of the state of 1909, and  8,966 of the Revised Statutes of 1899\n\n\n Section 10,301 provides that 'all arrangements, contracts, agreements, combinations, or understandings made or entered into between two or more persons, designed or made with a view to lessen, or which tend to lessen, lawful trade, or full and free competition in the importation, transportation, manufacture, or sale' in the state 'of any product, commodity, or article, or thing bought and sold,' and all such arrangements, etc., 'which are designed or made with a view to increase, or which tend to increase, the market price of any product, commodity, or article, or thing, of any class or kind whatsoever, \n\n[234 U.S. 199, 208]\n\u00a0\n bought and sold,' are declared to be against public policy, unlawful and void, and those offending 'shall be deemed and adjudged guilty of a conspiracy in restraint of trade, and punished' as provided.\n Section 8,966 provides that arrangements, etc., such as described in  10,301, having like purpose, and all such arrangements, etc., 'whereby or under the terms of which it is proposed, stipulated, provided, agreed, or understood that any person, association of persons, or corporations doing business in' the state, 'shall deal in, sell, or offer for sale' in the state 'any particular or specific article, product, or commodity, and shall not, during the continuance or existence of any such arrangement , . . . deal in, sell, or offer for sale,' in the state, 'any competing article, product, or commodity,' are declared to be against public policy, unlawful and void; and any person offending 'shall be deemed and adjudged guilty of a conspiracy to defraud, and be subject to the penalties' provided.\n By  10,304 of the Revised Statutes of 1909, it is provided that domestic offending corporations shall forfeit their charters and all or any part of their property as shall be adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, or be fined in lieu of the forfeiture of charters or of property.\n Foreign offending corporations shall forfeit their right to do business in the state, with forfeiture also of property, or, in lieu thereof, the payment of a fine.\n In State ex rel. Hadley v. Standard Oil Co. 218 Mo. 1, 370, 372, 116 S. W. 902, the supreme court held that the anti-trust statutes of the state 'are limited in their scope and operation to persons and corporations dealing in commodities, and do not include combinations of persons engaged in labor pursuits.' And, justifying the statutes against a charge of illegal discrimination, the court further said that 'it must be borne in mind that the differentiation between labor and property is so great that they do not belong to the same \n\n[234 U.S. 199, 209]\n\u00a0\n general or natural classification of rights or things, and have never been so recognized by the common law or by legislative enactments.'\n Accepting the construction put upon the statute, but contesting its legality as thus construed, plaintiff in error makes three contentions: (1) The statutes, as so construed, unreasonably and arbitrarily limit the right of contract; (2) discriminate between the vendors of commodities and the vendors of labor and services; and (3) between vendors and purchasers of commodities.\n\n\n (1)\n The specification under this head is that the supreme court found, it is contended, benefit-not injury-to the public had resulted from the alleged combination. Granting that this is not an overstatement of the opinion, the answer is immediate. It is too late in the day to assert against statutes which forbid combinations of competing companies that a particular combination was induced by good intentions and has had some good effect. Armour Packing Co. v. United States, \n209 \nU.S. 56, 62\n, 52 S. L. ed. 681, 684, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 428; Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20, 49\n, 57 S. L. ed. 107, 117, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 9. The purpose of such statutes is to secure competition and preclude combinations which tend to defeat it. And such is explicitly the purpose and policy of the Missouri statutes; and they have been sustained by the Supreme Court. There is nothing in the Constitution of the United States which precludes a state from adopting and enforcing such policy. To so decide would be stepping backwards. Carroll v. Greenwich Ins. Co. \n199 U.S. 401\n, 50 L. ed. 246, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66; Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota, \n226 U.S. 157\n, 57 L. ed. 164, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66.\n It is true that the supreme court did not find a definite abuse of its powers by plaintiff in error, but it did find that there was an offending against the statute, a union of able competitors, and a cessation of their competition, and the court said: 'Some of the smaller concerns that were competitors in the market have ceased their struggle for existence and retired from the field.' This is one \n\n[234 U.S. 199, 210]\n\u00a0\n of the results which the statute was intended to prevent,-the unequal struggle of individual effort against the power of combination. The preventing of the engrossment of trade is as definitely the object of the law as is price regulation of commodities, its prohibition being against combinations 'made with a view to lessen, or which tend to lessen, lawful trade or full and free competition in the importation, transportation, manufacture, or sale of any commodity, or article, or thing bought or sold.' See Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 U.S. 1\n, 55 L. ed. 619, 34 L.R. A.(N.S.) 834, 31 Sup. Cr. Rep. 502, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734; United States v. American Tobacco Co. \n221 U.S. 106\n, 55 L. ed. 663, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 632; United States v. Patten, \n226 U.S. 525\n, 57 L. ed. 333, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 325, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 141.\n\n\n (2)\n and (3). These contentions may be considered together, both involving a charge of discrimination,-the one because the law does not embrace vendors of labor; the other because it does not cover purchasers of commodities as well as vendors of them. Both, therefore, invoke a consideration of the power of classification which may be exerted in the legislation of the state. And we shall presently see that power has very broad range. A classification is not invalid because of simple inequality. We said in Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Matthews, \n174 \nU.S. 96, 106\n, 43 S. L. ed. 909, 913, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 609, by Mr. Justice Brewer: 'The very idea of classification is that of inequality, so that it goes without saying that the fact of inequality in no manner determines the matter of constitutionality.' Therefore, it may be there is restraint of competition in a combination of laborers and in a combination of purchasers, but that does not demonstrate that legislation which does not include either combination is illegal. Whether it would have been better policy to have made such comprehensive classification it is not our province to decide. In other words, whether a combination of wage earners or purchasers of commodities called for repression by law under the conditions in the state was for the legislature of the state to determine. \n\n[234 U.S. 199, 211]\n\u00a0\n In Carroll v. Greenwich Ins. Co. supra, a statute of Iowa was considered which made it unlawful for two or more fire insurance companies doing business in the state, or their officers or agents, to make or enter into combinations or agreements in relation to the rates to be charged for in surance, and certain other matters. The provision was held invalid by the circuit court of the United States for the district of Iowa on the ground of depriving of liberty of contract secured by the 14th Amendment and of the equal protection of the laws. This court reversed the decision, saying, after stating that there was a general statute of Iowa which prohibited combinations to fix the price of any article of merchandise or commodity, or to limit the quantity of the same produced or sold in the state: 'Therefore, the act in question does little, if anything, more than apply and work out the policy of the general law in a particular case.' Again, 'If an evil is specially experienced in a particular branch of business, the Constitution embodies no prohibition of laws confined to the evil, or doctrinaire requirement that they should be couched in all- embracing terms.' And, 'If the legislature of the state of Iowa deems it desirable artificially to prevent, so far as it can, the substitution of combination for competition, this court cannot say that fire insurance may not present so conspicuous an example of what that legislature thinks an evil as to justify special treatment. The imposition of a more specific liability upon life and health insurance companies was held valid in Fidelity Mutual Life Asso. v. Mettler, \n185 U.S. 308\n, 46 L. ed. 922, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 662.' Other cases were also cited in illustration.\n Carroll v. Greenwich Ins. Co. supra, is especially opposite. It contains the elements of the case at bar and a decision upon them. It will be observed that the statute, which it was said declared the general policy of Iowa, was a prohibition against a combination of producers and sellers. There was the same distinction, therefore, be- \n\n[234 U.S. 199, 212]\n\u00a0\n tween vendors and purchasers of commodities as in the Missouri statute, and the same omission of prohibition of combinations of vendors of labor and services as in the Missouri law. The distinction and omission were continued when the policy of the state was extended to insurance companies. The law was not condemned because it went no farther, because it did not prohibit the combination of all trades, businesses, and persons. We held that the omission was not for judicial cognizance, and that a court could not say that fire insurance might not present so conspicuous an example of what the legislature might think an evil 'as to justify special treatment.'\n We might leave the discussion with that and the other cases. They decide that we are helped little in determining the legality of a legislative classification by making broad generalizations, and it is for a broad generalization that plaintiff in error contends,-indeed, a generalization which includes all the activities and occupations of life; and there is an enumeration of wage earners in emphasis of the discrimination in which manufacturers and sellers are singled out from all others. The contention in deceptive, and yet it is earnestly urged in various ways which it would extend this opinion too much to detail. 'In dealing with restraints of trade,' it is said, 'the proper basis of classification is obviously neither in commodities nor services, nor in persons, but in restraints.' A law, to be valid, therefore, is the inflexible deduction, cannot distinguish between ' restraints,' but must apply to all restraints, whatever their degree or effect or purpose; and that because the Missouri statute has not this universal operation it offends against the equality required by the 14th Amendment. This court has decided many times that a legislative classification does not have to possess such comprehensive extent. Classification must be accommodated to the problems of legislation; and we decided in Ozan Lumber Co. v. Union County Nat. Bank, 207 U. S. \n\n[234 U.S. 199, 213]\n\u00a0\n 251, 52 L. ed. 195, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 89, that it may depend upon degrees of evil without being arbitrary or unreasonable. We repeated the ruling in Heath & M. Mfg. Co. v. Worst, \n207 U.S. 338\n, 52 L. ed. 236, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 114, in Engel v. O'Malley, \n219 U.S. 128\n, 55 L. ed. 128, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190, in Mutual Loan Co. v. Martell, \n222 U.S. 225\n, 56 L. ed. 175, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 74, Ann. Cas. 1913B, 529, and again in German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, \n233 \nU.S. 389, 418\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 612. In the latter case a distinction was sustained against a charge of discrimination between stock fire insurance companies and farmers' mutual insurance companies insuring farm property. If this power of classification did not exist, to what straits legislation would be brought. We may illustrate by the examples furnished by plaintiff in error. In the enumeration of those who, it is contended, by combination are able to restrain trade, are included, among others, 'persons engaged in domestic service' and 'nurses;' and because these are not embraced in the law, plaintiff in error, it is contended, although a combination of companies uniting the power of $120,000,000, and able thereby to engross 85 per cent or 90 per cent of the trade in agricultural implements, is nevertheless beyond the competency of the legislature to prohibit. As great as the contrast is, a greater one may be made. Under the principle applied a combination of all the great industrial enterprises (and why not railroads as well?) could not be condemned unless the law applied as well to a combination of maidservants or to infants' nurses, whose humble functions preclude effective combination. Such contrasts and the considerations they suggest must be pushed aside by government, and a rigid and universal classification applied, is the contention of plaintiff in error; and to this the contention must come. Admit exceptions, and you admit the power of the legislature to select them. But it may be said the comparison of extremes is forensic, and, it may be, fallacious; that there may be powerful labor combinations as well as powerful industrial combinations, and weak ones of both, and that the law, to be valid, cannot distin- \n\n[234 U.S. 199, 214]\n\u00a0\n guish between strong and weak offenders. This may be granted (Engel v. O'Malley, \n219 U.S. 128\n, 55 L. ed. 128, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190), but the comparisons are not without value in estimating the contentions of plaintiff in error. The foundation of our decision is, of course, the power of classification which a legislature may exercise, and the cases we have cited, as well as others which may be cited, demonstrate that some latitude must be allowed to the legislative judgment in selecting the 'basis of community.' We have said that it must be palpably arbitrary to authorize a judicial review of it, and that it cannot be disturbed by the courts 'unless they can see clearly that there is no fair reason for the law that would not require with equal force its extension to others whom it leaves untouched.' Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. May, \n194 \nU.S. 267, 269\n, 48 S. L. ed. 971, 972, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638; Williams v. Arkansas, \n217 \nU.S. 79, 90\n, 54 S. L. ed. 673, 677, 30 Sup. Ct.

In the first there was a difference made between landowners as to liability for permitting certain noxious grasses to go to seed on the lands. In the second, the statute passed on made a difference between businesses in the solicitation of patronage on railroad trains and at depots. In the third, a difference based on the evidence of qualification of physicians was declared valid. clared valid.\n In Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Commercial Mill. Co. \n218 U.S. 406\n, 54 L. ed. 1088, 36 L.R.A.(N.S.) 220, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 59, 21 Ann. Cas. 815, a distinction was made between common carriers in the power to limit liability for negligence. In Engel v. O'Malley, supra, a distinction between bankers was sustained; and in Provident Inst. for Sav. v. Malone, \n221 U.S. 660\n, 55 L. ed. 899, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1129, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 661, deposits in savings banks were distinguished from deposits in other banks in the application of the statute of limitations.\n Other cases might be cited whose instances illustrate the same principle, in which this court has refused to accept the higher generalizations urged as necessary to the fulfilment of the constitutional guaranty of the equal pro- \n\n[234 U.S. 199, 215]\n\u00a0\n tection of the law, and in which we, in effect, held that it is competent for a legislature to determine upon what differences a distinction may be made for the purpose of statutory classification between objects otherwise having resemblances. Such power, of course, cannot be arbitrarily exercised. The distinction made must have reasonable basis. Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Sav. Bank, \n170 U.S. 283\n, 42 L. ed. 1037, 18 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 678.\n And so in the case at bar. Whether the Missouri statute should have set its condemnation on restraints generally, prohibiting combined action for any purpose and to everybody, or confined it as the statute does to manufacturers and vendors of articles, and permitting it to purchasers of such articles; prohibiting it to sellers of commodities and permitting it to sellers of services, was a matter of legislative judgment; and we cannot say that the distinctions made are palpably arbitrary, which we have seen is the condition of judicial review. It is to be remembered that the question presented is of the power of the legislature, not the policy of the exercise of the power. To be able to find fault, therefore, with such policy, is not to establish the invalidity of the law based upon it.\n It is said that the statute as construed by the supreme court of the state comes within our ruling in Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 U.S. 540\n, 46 L. ed. 679, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431, but we do not think so. If it did, we should, of course, apply that ruling here.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION v.

Blair for appellees.\n\n\n[234 U.S. 294, 302]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railway Company, the Southern Pacific Company, and the San Pedro, Los Angeles, & Salt Lake Railroad Company, brought this suit against the Interstate Commerce Commission in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Kansas, first division, to restrain the enforcement of an order of the Commission made in April, 1910. The order required these companies to desist 'from exacting their present charge of $2.50 per car for delivering and receiving carload freight to and from industries located upon spurs and side tracks within their respective switching limits' in Los Angeles, California, when such carload freight 'is moving in interstate commerce incidentally to a system-line haul.' It also prohibited the exaction of any charge whatever, other than the charge for transportation from points of origin to destination, for delivering or receiving carload freight in such cases. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[234 U.S. 294, 303]\n\u00a0\n After answer had been filed by the Commission, the suit was transferred to the commerce court, and the United States, the Associated Jobbers of Los Angeles, and the Pacific Coast Jobbers' & Manufacturers' Association, intervened. The United States thereupon moved to dismiss the bill for want of equity, and the petitioners asked for a preliminary injunction. The commerce court, denying the government's motion, suspended the Commission's order until the further order of the court (188 Fed. 229, 929); and this appeal is prosecuted.\n The complaint of the petitioners in substance is that they have established in the city of Los Angeles their public terminals, including what are known as team tracks and freight sheds, for the accommodation of the public in receiving and delivering carload freight; that these facilities are entirely adequate for the purpose, and are \n\n[234 U.S. 294, 304]\n\u00a0\n sufficient to handle all the carload freight shipped or delivered in the city, including that now received or delivered upon the industrial spur tracks in question; that the spur-track service has been established simply for the convenience of the shippers thus served; that it is a service essentially distinct from the line haul, and additional thereto, being of great benefit in the saving of cartage charges to the favored shippers for whose use the spur tracks were constructed; that the industries or plants located upon the spurs are distant from the main tracks, in the case of the Atchison Company, from 1\/5 mile to 3 1\/2 miles, in that of the Southern Pacific Company from 200 feet to 7 miles, and in that of the San Pedro Company from 1\/5 mile to 4 miles, and that the special switching service involves a much greater expense than if the carload freight were received or delivered on the team tracks or at the freight sheds of the carriers respectively; that the charge of $2.50 per car for this service is entirely reasonable, and one which the carriers are entitled to make in addition to the line haul rate; and that, as such, it has been duly specified in their published tariffs. It is also averred that, while in the contracts governing the construction and maintenance of the spur tracks no specific sum was prescribed for the service of receiving and delivering carload freight thereon, the charge above mentioned had been generally established; that at the time of the making of these contracts the shippers understood and willingly consented that, if the railway company performed this special service, there should be additional compensation, and that such charge has generally been maintained and collected. The adequacy of the public terminal facilities for carload freight in Los Angeles (consisting of the team tracks and freight sheds of the carriers respectively), the facts set forth with respect to the construction of the spur tracks, their location, the acquiescence in the switching charge and its maintenance, were established before the Com- \n\n[234 U.S. 294, 305]\n\u00a0\n mission, it is alleged, by undisputed evidence. It is further stated that on account of water and other competition, the rates of transportation to an from Los Angeles have been forced to an exceedingly low basis, so that the companies do not receive the amount to which they are justly entitled, and that they ought not to be required to perform the service in question without reasonable reward. The Commission's order was assailed as beyond its authority, involving a discrimination in favor of the owners of plants located upon the spur tracks, and a deprivation of the property of the carriers without due process of law.\n The report of the Commission (18 Inters. Com. Rep. 310) was made a part of the bill. It appears that the proceeding before the Commission was instituted by the Associated Jobbers of Los Angeles, and was directed against two distinct practices, involving the spur-track switching charges incident to a system-line haul and to a foreign-line haul respectively. The propriety of such a charge when the line haul was by a foreign carrier was sustained, and the prohibitory order was confined to cases where the charge was made in connection with a system-line haul. The pertinent facts, as found by the Commission, are substantially as follows:\n Each of the carriers has designated certain territory as within its switching or yard limits in the city of Los Angeles, extending for 6 or 7 miles in a general easterly and westerly direction, and including numerous tracks, main lines, branch lines, industry spurs, classification tracks, team tracks, freight-shed tracks, hold tracks, repair tracks, and others, and also their stations, freight sheds, derricks, roundhouses, and other structures. Freight moving in carloads is delivered at team tracks, at freight sheds, or at industry spurs. At team tracks and freight sheds no charge is imposed for the receipt or delivery of such carload freight over the freight rate named in the tariffs, while at industry spurs an additional \n\n[234 U.S. 294, 306]\n\u00a0\n charge of $2.50 is imposed on every loaded car moving either in or out. These industry spurs vary in length, some leading directly from the main track into or alongside of the industries served, while others are of greater length and branch at one or more points, short spurs running off from what is known as the 'lead' to serve other industries in the immediate neighborhood. These spurs have been constructed under substantially uniform contracts. \n2\n None of the industries at Los Angeles fur- \n\n[234 U.S. 294, 307]\n\u00a0\n nishes its own motive power, and interline switching is done from the interchange track to the industry by the locomotives of the delivering lien, the carrier performing the switching service.\n The Commission found that these spur tracks were portions of the terminal facilities of the carriers with whose lines they connected, being distinguished from mere plant facilities such as were under consideration in Chicago & A. R. Co. v. United States, 26 L.R.A.(N.S.) 551, 84 C. C. A. 324, 156 Fed. 558, and in the cases of the General Electric Co. and Solvay Process Co. 14 Inters. Com. Rep. 237, 246. Each of the spurs here considered, said the Commission, is, in a real sense, a railroad terminal at which the carrier receives and delivers freight. It further appears from the report that the charge for spur-track delivery has been made by all of the carriers at Los Angeles as long as the railroads have had access to that city; that it was first imposed by the Southern Pacific, and as the other lines came in they adopted the policy of the line already there; that, as to certain commodities, the charge was not imposed until quite recently, and at all times until the Hepburn act [Act of June 29, 1906, 34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1288] went into effect there was great variation in charge as between individual shippers. It is added that there are 97 places in California to which what are known as coast terminal rates apply, rates lower than to intermediate points; only in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego is there such a charge for spur-track delivery, though in many of these places such delivery is furnished. To the north, in Portland, Seattle, Tacoma, and a large number of other points which also enjoy coast terminal \n\n[234 U.S. 294, 308]\n\u00a0\n rates, the Southern Pacific, Northern Pacific, and Great Northern lines impose no such charge, and to the east, where defendants' lines have their termini in cities competing with Los Angeles, this charge is also unknown.\n The Commission thus described the character of the service in question: 'Spurtrack delivery is a substitute service,-a service which it has solicited the right to give, as the evidence here shows,-a service which costs the industry for the installation of the track and the use of its property as a railway terminal. It is a service over the carrier's own rails to a point where it yields possession of the property transported, and which involves no greater expense than would team-track delivery. It relieves the carrier's team tracks and sheds, necessitating less outlay for expense of yards in a crowded city, promotes the speedy release of equipment, and vastly aids in conducting a commerce which is greater than the carrier's own facilities could freely, adequately, and economically handle.\n'Again, it is not to be overlooked that the delivery given on an industry spur is not supplemental to any other delivery. Cars destined to industry spurs are not placed first at a spur, depot, or on the team tracks, or at the sheds, and later switched to oblige the consignee. A train of freight cars goes to the breaking-up yards which lie at the entrance to the city, and there it is divided up with respect to the character of the freight in the various cars and their destination. No one has access to the cars at this point. This yard is purely a railroad facility. After the cars are segregated they are taken to the tracks to which they are ordered,-some to the various team tracks distributed along the main line, some to different industries; some, perhaps, to the railroad shops or to freight sheds or to the stock yards. Before the cars are placed, the consignees are given notice of the tracks to which they are to be sent, so that there is no confusion, and the switch \n\n[234 U.S. 294, 309]\n\u00a0\n engines which place the cars on one track also serve to haul the 'loads' in and 'empties' out at the other tracks. After a most exhaustive inquiry we cannot find, taking this service as a whole in the same way that it is treated by the carriers, that the service is more expensive to the carrier than if all cars were given team-track delivery.\n\n'An additional charge may be made when an additional service is given. But the service here given is not additional to that for which the rate pays. If the shipper pays for team-track delivery and does not receive it, but asks instead and is given a side track delivery, which costs the carrier no more, he may not be compelled to pay an additional charge upon the assumption that he has received a terminal team-track service which has not been given. A carrier may not so construct its rates as to compel an extra charge for like service, and this, in our judgment, the defendants at Los Angeles have done.' 18 Inters. Com. Rep. pp. 317, 318.\n\n\n 1. \nIt is urged that the Commission's order rests upon a construction of the statute which would forbid any carrier from separating its terminal and haulage charges on the same shipment, and that this is a fundamental misconception of the law.\n We do not think that the order is open to this objection. It is true that the Commission directed attention to the distinction between the American and English methods of stating rates, pointing out that the English practice of fixing separate schedules for 'conveyance' and 'station terminal' rates had not obtained in this country so far as the records of the Commission show. The opinion was expressed that the provisions of the act to regulate commerce were enacted with reference to the American method of rate-making, and that the rate which the statute requires to be published is 'a complete rate,' including 'not only the charge for hauling, but the charge for the use of \n\n[234 U.S. 294, 310]\n\u00a0\n the terminals at both ends of the line.' 18 Inters. Com. Rep. pp. 315, 316. We need not stop to consider whether this is a correct interpretation of the act, for the question of a segregation of haulage and terminal charges ( meaning, by the latter, charges for the use of ordinary terminal stations in receiving and delivering goods) was not before the Commission, and its propriety was not necessarily involved in the decision. No such segregation had been attempted by the carriers here. On the contrary, it was undisputed that the line-haul carload rate comprehended receipt and delivery on team tracks or at freight sheds.\n The Commission conceded the right of the carrier to charge for any terminal service that was accessorial. But it was held that an additional charge was not justified if additional service was not in fact rendered.\n\n 2. \nNor do we understand that the Commission ruled that the receipt and delivery of goods at plants located upon spurs or side tracks could not, in any circumstances, be regarded as a distinct service for which separate compensation might be demanded. Cases of an interior movement of plant traffic to and from various parts of the establishment, and of deliveries through a system of interior switching tracks constructed as plant facilities, were expressly distinguished by the Commission (18 Inters. Com. Rep. pp. 313, 314); and it is apparent that the ruling of the Commission would not apply in any case where, by reason of the location and extent of the spur tracks and the character of the movement, the facts were essentially different from those upon which the decision was based. ( Interstate Commerce Commission v. Stickney, \n215 \nU.S. 98, 105\n, 54 S. L. ed. 112, 113, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 66.)\n\n 3. \nOn the other hand, it cannot be maintained that the delivery and receipt of goods on industrial spur tracks within the switching limits in a city is necessarily an added service for which the carrier is entitled to make, or should make, a charge additional to the line-haul rate to \n\n[234 U.S. 294, 311]\n\u00a0\n or from that city, when the line-haul rate embraces a receiving and delivering service for which the spur-track service is a substitute. It is said that carriers are bound to carry only to or from their terminal stations. But when industrial spur tracks have been established within the carrier's switching limits, within which, also, various team tracks are located, these spurs may in fact constitute an essential part of the carrier's terminal system. It was stated by the Commission that carriers throughout the country treat industry spurs of the kind here in question 'as portions of their terminals, making no extra charge for service thereto when the carrier receives the benefit of the line haul out or in.' It was added that while this general statement covered perhaps ten thousand cities and towns in the United States, the carriers before the Commission could name only three exceptions; to wit, the cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego. But, laying the generalization on one side, it is plain that the question whether or not there is at any point an additional service in connection with industrial spur tracks upon which to base an extra charge, or whether there is merely a substituted service, which is substantially a like service to that included in the line-haul rate, and not received, is a question of fact to be determined according to the actual conditions of operation.\n Such a question is manifestly one upon which it is the province of the Commission to pass.\n\n 4. \nWe must therefore take the findings of the Commission in the present case as to the character and manner of use of the industrial spurs in Los Angeles-that they constituted part of the carrier's terminals, and that under the conditions there existing, the receipt and delivery of goods on these spurs was a like service as compared with the receipt and delivery of goods at team tracks and freight sheds-as conclusions of fact. Assuming that they were based upon evidence, they are not open to review. Balti- \n\n[234 U.S. 294, 312]\n\u00a0\n more & O. R. Co. v. United States, \n215 \nU.S. 481, 495\n, 54 S. L. ed. 292, 297, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 164; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. \n220 \nU.S. 235, 251\n, 55 S. L. ed. 448, 456, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 392; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union P. R. Co. \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 548 S., 56 L. ed. 308, 311, 312, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 108; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & N. R. Co. \n227 \nU.S. 88, 92\n, 57 S. L. ed. 431, 433, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 185; Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 199, 221\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 291.\n In this view, we find no ground for holding the order of the Commission to be invalid. It is not denied that the complaining shippers and these carriers were heard before the Commission, and that evidence disclosing the terminal situation in Los Angeles, and the nature and use of the various tracks within the switching limits, was presented; and it cannot be doubted that the case demanded an appreciation of a variety of details, or minor facts, in order that the ultimate questions of fact could be determined. It is said that it was established by undisputed evidence that the team tracks and freight sheds provided by the carriers were fully adequate for all carload freight. Putting aside the denial by the Commission of this allegation, it is evident that the question was not simply as to such adequacy, but as to the actual use of the various tracks, the services thereon relatively considered, and whether there was really an extra service in the circumstances shown. Again, it is said that the Commission did not find the switching charge in itself, that is, taken separately, to be unreasonable, but the inquiry was whether, in view of the conditions of the distribution of the carload freight through a large area, there was in fact such a similarity of movement as to negative the basis for a separate charge. It is further urged that while the contracts for the construction of these spurs did not fix the charge, it was proved by undisputed evidence that at the time these contracts were made the shippers consented to a special charge if freight were received and delivered thereon, and that the charge in question had been generally \n\n[234 U.S. 294, 313]\n\u00a0\n maintained. The service, however, was performed subject to the law of the land requiring that the carrier's charges should not be unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory. See Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Mottley, \n219 \nU.S. 467, 482\n, 55 S. L. ed. 297, 303, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 671, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 265; Philadelphia, B. & W. R. Co. v. Schubert, \n224 \nU.S. 603, 613\n, 614 S., 56 L. ed. 911, 916, 917, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 589, 1 N. C. C. A. 892. If it became apparent that the shippers were subjected to an arbitrary and unwarranted exaction, they were in no way estopped from bringing the matter before the body created by law to deal with such questions, and from securing its order directing the carriers to stop the objectionable practice.\n But it is contended that the finding of the Commission is opposed to the admitted physical facts, and reference is made to the transportation to and from industrial plants located from 1\/5 of a mile to 7 miles from the main track of the carrier. We find no such fundamental unsoundness in the Commission's conclusions. It appeared, as already stated, that the carrier had designated certain territory as within its switching or yard limits in Los Angeles, extending for 6 or 7 miles, and 'including numerous tracks, main lines, branch lines, industry tracks, team tracks, freight- shed tracks, and various structures.' It does not appear how many industries were within a short distance, or to how many the statement as to the greatest distance above-mentioned applied. The carrier did not fix a charge according to the comparative service in the case of these various industrial plants. It made the same switching charge whether the distance was 200 feet or 7 miles; that is, it dealt with the situation upon an average basis, making the same charge for all this switching in a given area which constituted its terminal district. It was the service within these switching limits that the Commission was considering. Manifestly it was permissible to establish such a district, and taking the team-track and freight-shed service in that area, and the average spur-track service, the Commission reached the conclusion set forth. It is said \n\n[234 U.S. 294, 314]\n\u00a0\n that the finding of the Commission as to the comparative cost of the service was not affirmative, but was merely a negative statement to the effect that the Commission was unable to find that the cost of spur-track delivery was more expensive to the carrier. While this form of expression was used at one place in the Commission's report, at another the service in question was described as one which involved 'no greater expense than would team-track delivery,' and we cannot but regard this as the Commission's finding upon the evidence. It is then insisted that the contrary of this finding is self-evident; but the facts with respect to the movement of freight in a great terminal district are by no means so simple that the deliberate judgment of the Commission can be regarded as contradicting the obvious.\n The argument for the petitioners necessarily invites the court to substitute its judgment for that of the Commission upon matters of fact within the Commission's province. This is not the function of the court. We cannot regard the act to regulate commerce as justifying an increased or extra charge for a substantially similar service, and upon the case made it cannot be said that the Commission has overstepped its authority in forbidding the charge in question as one which was unjustly discriminatory.\n In our opinion the Commerce Court erred in denying the government's motion to dismiss, and in granting the petitioners' motion for injunction. The order of the Commerce Court is therefore reversed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of California, Southern Division, with instructions to dismiss the bill. Act of Oct. 22, 1913, chap. 32, Stat. 1913, p. 221.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The order is as follows:\n'This case being at issue on complaint and answer on file, and having been duly heard and submitted by the parties, and full investigation of the matters and things involved having been had, and the Commission having, on the date hereof, made and filed a report containing its findings of fact and conclusions thereon, which said report is hereby referred to and made a part hereof, and having found that the present charge of $2.50 per car, exacted by the several defendants for delivering and receiving carload freight to and from industries located upon spurs and side tracks within their respective switching limits at Los Angeles, California, when such carload freight is moving in interstate commerce incidentally to a system-line haul, is in violation of the act to regulate commerce:\n\n'It is ordered, That said defendants be, and they are hereby, notified and required to cease and desist, on or before the 1st day of July, 1910, and for a period of not less than two years thereafter abstain, from exacting their present charge of $2.50 per car for delivering and receiving carload freight to and from industries located upon spurs and side tracks within their respective switching limits in the said city of Los Angeles, California, when such carload freight is moving in interstate commerce incidentally to a system-line haul.\n\n'It is further ordered, That said defendants be, and they are hereby, notified and required to cease and desist, on or before the 1st day of July, 1910, and for a period of not less than two years thereafter abstain, from exacting any charge whatever, other than the charge for transportation from points of origin to destination, for delivering or receiving carload freight to or from industries located upon spurs or side tracks within their respective switching limits in the said city of Los Angeles, California, when such carload freight is moving in interstate commerce incidentally to a system-line haul.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The standard form of the Southern Pacific Company provides as follows:\n'1.

This suit was thereupon brought in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Kansas, first division, against the Interstate Commerce Commission, to restrain the enforcement of the order.

Supp. 1911, p. 195] governing the right to review cases in the district of Alaska or any division thereof, power is conferred on the circuit court of appeals of the ninth circuit to review, and its judgments in such cases are made final, all cases, including all criminal cases 'other than those in which a writ of error or appeal will lie direct to the Supreme Court of the United States, as provided in section two hundred and forty-seven.' It is obvious that this section changed the general rule of the prior law by taking capital cases out of the class which could come, because they were capital cases, directly to this court, and by bringing such cases within the final reviewing power of the circuit court of appeals of the ninth circuit.\n Section 247, which, as pointed out in  134, defines the cases which are excepted from the general rule provided by  134, gives authority to this court to directly review the action of the district courts of Alaska 'in prize cases; and in all cases which involve the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States, or in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States, or the validity or construction of any treaty made under its authority, is drawn in question, or in which the constitution or law of a state is claimed to be in contravention of the Constitution of the United States.'\n These provisions being but a re-expression of the language by which the subject of direct review by this court was governed, as provided in the 5th section of the judiciary act of 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, 488], the settled meaning which was affixed by the decisions of this court to the provisions as found in the act of 1891 necessarily determines the significance of the provisions of the section under consideration.\n In Ansbro v. United States, \n159 U.S. 695\n, 40 L. ed. 310, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 187, where it became necessary in a criminal case to determine whether there was a right to come directly to this court from a circuit court of the United States in virtue of the \n\n[233 U.S. 581, 584]\n\u00a0\n provisions of the 5th section of the act of 1891, the court, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, said:\n'The jurisdiction of this court must be maintained, then, if at all, on the ground that this is a case 'that involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States,' or 'in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States is drawn in question.' But we cannot find that any constitutional question was raised at the trial. Motions to quash, to instruct the jury to find for the defendant, for new trial, and in arrest of judgment, were made, but in neither of them, so far as appears, nor by any exception to rulings on the admission or exclusion of evidence, nor to instructions given, or the refusal of instructions asked, was any suggestion made that defendant was being denied any constitutional right, or that the law under which he was indicted was unconstitutional. The first time that anything appears upon that subject is in the assignment of errors, filed February 13, 1895\n\n\n\n'A case may be said to involve the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States when a title, right, privilege, or immunity is claimed under that instrument, but a definite issue in respect of the possession of the right must be distinctly deducible from the record before the judgment of the court below can be revised, on the ground of error in the disposal of such a claim by its decision. . . . An assignment of errors cannot be availed of to import questions into a cause which the record does not show were raised in the court below, and rulings asked thereon, so as to give jurisdiction to this court under the 5th section of the act of March 3, 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549].'\n\n And the doctrine thus announced has been followed and applied in many cases. Cornell v. Green, \n163 \nU.S. 75, 79\n, 79 S., 80, 41 L. ed. 76-78, 16 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 127.\n The assignments of error relate to these subjects: 1. Error asserted to have been committed by the court in refusing to allow a continuance pending the arrival of certain witnesses, thereby, it is asserted, 'denying the defendant the right to have their counsel make an opening statement to the jury.' 2. Error committed by the court in permitting the jury, with the consent of the accused, to separate after they were selected and impaneled and sworn. 3. Error by the court in refusing to discharge the jury because of an alleged publication made in a local newspaper during the trial, although the refusal of the court was based upon its opinion, formed after a statement by the jurors, that they had not seen the publication referred to. 4. Error committed by the court in admitting in evidence against Fushimi a statement made by him concerning the crime.\n But in the light of the settled rule which we have stated it is apparent on the face of the record that the assignments are wholly inadequate to give us the power to directly review, since there is nothing whatever directly or indirectly even intimating that the reliance on the Constitution was stated at the trial below in any form.\n It may be fairly presumed under these circumstances that the direct writ of error from this court was sued out overlooking the fact that, by operation of the Judicial Code, the general right to direct review in capital cases was taken away, or that the writ was prosecuted upon the assumption that the right to a direct review existed in any case where it was possible in this court to argue as to the existence of a constitutional right, wholly irrespective of whether the constitutional question relied upon was raised and considered in the lower court. But the latter conception overlooks the conclusively settled rule to which we have referred that the power to directly review \n\n[233 U.S. 581, 586]\n\u00a0\n because of a constitutional question obtains only where such question was involved in the trial court; that is, was there actually raised. The destructive effect on the distribution of judicial power made by the act of 1891 which would result from holding that jurisdiction to directly review obtained in any case because of a constitutional question, irrespective of the making of such question in the trial court, merely because of the possibility, after completion of the trial below, of suggesting for the first time such question as the foundation for resorting to direct review, is apparent and finds apt illustration in this case. Thus, although the accused made no objection, constitutional or otherwise, to the permission given by the court to the jury to separate, and indeed expressly assented to such separation, yet, as one of the grounds for direct review by this court it is insisted that, as the Constitution guaranteed a jury trial according to the course of the common law, and permission to separate could not be granted under that law, therefore the accused was deprivied of a constitutional right.\n It is to be observed that confining the right to direct review because of a constitutional question to cases where such question was raised in the trial court, that is, was there involved, does not deprive this court of the ultimate power to pass upon constitutional questions where it is necessary to do so, since if such a question, not raised in the trial court, germinates or emerges in a circuit court of appeals, the right of that court to certify affords an opportunity of obtaining a review of the question by this court, and, in the absence of a certification of the question, the authority of this court to grant a writ of certiorari would enable the same result to be accomplished if, in the judgment of this court, the constitutional question was of sufficient importance to justify the calling into play of that power.\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","104":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOHN II ESTATE v. BROWN(1914)\nNo. 98\nArgued: November 13, 1914Decided: December 7, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 342, 343]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Reuben D. Silliman, Joseph Larocque, and Clarence Blair Mitchell for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. A. A. Wilder and F. E. Thompson for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 342, 345]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case began as a proceeding by the United States for the taking of certain land. The land was condemned and the sum that was determined by the judgment to be the compensation due to the owners was paid into court. Supplementary proceedings then were had in the cause, according to local statutes, for the determination of the title to this fund as among different claimants who appeared and set up their claims. The plaintiff in error \n\n[235 U.S. 342, 346]\n\u00a0\n claimed the whole by virtue of a deed from Irene Ii (Brown), daughter of John Ii, to its grantor, alleging that John Ii devised the land to Irene in fee, and that her title in fee was established by judgments of the supreme courts of the Hawaiian Islands and of the territory of Hawaii. The defendants in error, two of the three children of Irene, claim one third each, subject to their mother's life interest, on the ground that John Ii devised the land to Irene for life only, with remainder to her children. The circuit court of appeals sustained the latter claim. 119 C. C. A. 458, 201 Fed. 224.\n It will be enough to give a few passages from the agreed but more or less impugned translation of the will out of its original Hawaiian: 'All my property both real and personal shall descend to my heirs who are mentioned below as follows: First: Irene Haalou Ii, my own daughter is the first heir as follows: [describing certain lands including that condemned ] . . . I do hereby appoint J. Komoikehuehu, A. F. Judd, they both to be the executors and guardians of the person and property of my daughter the first devisee mentioned in this will. All the incomes from the lands that are leased and all other receipts from all the lands of my daughter they two alone shall have the sole care of it until she becomes of age or has children of her own; they shall be the executors during the lifetime of my daughter and her children in accordance with my wishes as expressed in this will. . . . And further, if my daughter shall die having borne children, then the property shall descend to her children and if she should die without having had any children the property shall descend to her own mother, and if she should be dead then the property shall descend to my brother J. Komoikehuehu.' It is obvious what hesitation an American court ought to feel in attempting to construe a Hawaiian will on the strength of this translation, and, still more, in disregarding the opinion of the court on the spot, familiar \n\n[235 U.S. 342, 347]\n\u00a0\n with Hawaiian habits, and not improbably with Hawaiian speech.\n John Ii died in 1870. In 1894, the Hawaiian waiian Islands then being an independent sovereignty, a bill was filed by Irene and her two children, the present defendants in error, by A. F. Judd as their next friend, and A. F. Judd, as executor, guardian of Irene, and trustee under the will, against Charles A. Brown, husband of Irene, alleging that Brown was in possession and squandering the estate, and praying, among other things, for a construction of the will and determination of the relative rights of the children and mother, and for the reinstatement of Judd in possession as trustee. An amended complaint joined Sanford B. Dole as plaintiff, he having been appointed to take the place of Komoikehuehu, deceased. The case dragged along and finally, the chief justice and one of the justices being disqualified, the remaining justice requested and authorized two members of the bar to sit with him, which they did. At the hearing they reserved questions of law to the supreme court of the Islands two of which were: '1. Was a trust created in the property devised to Irene Ii by the will of her father, John Ii? 5. Has Irene Ii Brown a fee-simple title in said property, or is her estate one for life only?' The supreme court entertained the case, and, as appears from the opinion, against the earnest contention of the counsel for the plaintiffs, decided on May 11, 1897, that Irene, after she bore a child, became the owner in fee simple of the estate. This decision is relied upon as an adjudication concluding the present case. Brown v. Brown, 11 Haw. 47.\n The chief objection that is urged to the conclusiveness of the decision is that after the opinion of the supreme court no further proceedings were taken in the case. This seems to be answered by the decision next mentioned, and by the analogy, if not by the letter, of the statute then in force as to cases stated; that the case, the submission, and \n\n[235 U.S. 342, 348]\n\u00a0\n the written decision, shall constitute the record. Civil Code of 1859,  1142. It is said further that the court was not legally constituted because two members of the bar were called in. The constitution and statutes allowed the filling of a vacancy if a justice was disqualified, but it is said that the power extended only to a single one. We understand that the practice was the other way for years, and as the supreme court seems to have felt no difficulty, it would be most undesirable to allow the question to be raised now. It is urged again that the children were not properly parties, and were not separately represented, although their interest was adverse to their mother's. The bill was brought by the trustee for instructions, among other things, and the cestuis que trust were made parties. It is true that they do not appear to have had separate counsel, but it appears from the decision of the court that the counsel represented and pressed their interest against that of their mother, and it seems to us not permissible to declare that the highest court of what was then a foreign jurisdiction did not know its own powers, and was proceeding in a manner that the court of another country might pronounce wholly void. Finally, it is said that under the statutes in force questions in equity could not be reserved by circuit judges sitting in chambers. To this again it is enough to answer that the court had authority to decide that matter, and, although disapproving the practice, entertained the cause and thereby established its warrant in law.\n In January, 1903, another bill was brought by the defendants in error, by their next friend, A. F. Judd, the purposes of which it is unnecessary to state further than it sought to have the previous decision declared void and the interest of Irene adjudged to be only a life estate. The bill was dismissed upon demurrer, and the supreme court of the territory expressed the opinion that the previous decision precluded a collateral attack by the \n\n[235 U.S. 342, 349]\n\u00a0\n minors, dealing in terms with all the objections except the first, which it sufficiently disposed of by assuming the prior decision to have the effect of a formal decree. Brown v. Brown, 15 Haw. 308. See Calaf y Fugurul v. Calaf y Rivera, \n232 \nU.S. 371, 374\n, 58 S. L. ed. 642, 645, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 411. It is unnecessary to consider whether this second case again made the matter res judicata. It is enough to refer to it here as authority with regard to matters of local procedure, as to which innumerable cases have established the weight to be given to the local courts. Tevis v.

Rep. 611.\n It appears to us surprising to suggest that the highest court of the Hawaiian Islands did not decide in accordance with the requirements of the law of which that court was the final mouthpiece; and that courts of another jurisdiction, sitting long afterwards, know its duties and powers so much better as to be entitled to pronounce its proceedings void. The caution required in such a venture, even as against less authoritative decisions, has been stated and restated, from United States v. Percheman, 7 Pet. 51, 95, 8 L. ed. 604, 620, to Michigan Trust Co. v. Ferry, \n228 \nU.S. 346, 354\n, 57 S. L. ed. 867, 874, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 550. And when it is added that the grounds for the supposed invalidity are matters mainly of form and local procedure, and wholly of local control, it seems to us plain that the judgment must be reversed.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJOHNSON v.

It appears that complainants are severally residents and citizens of the city of Bemidji, Beltrami county, Minnesota, and at the time of the filing of the \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 424]\n\u00a0\n bill were, and for a considerable time had been, engaged in business there as saloon keepers, selling at retail spirituous, vinous, and malt liquors at their respective places of business in that city, each of them having paid to the Federal and state governments, respectively, the necessary tax and license fees, and having a receipt from the Federal Government and a liquor license issued under the authority of the state of Minnesota by the municipal council and officials of the city. The bill alleged that each of the complainants had refrained from selling or disposing of any liquor to Indians, or individuals of Indian blood, and had complied with the Federal and state laws in this and in other respects; that each of them had built up and established a profitable and lucrative trade; and that the jurisdictional amount was involved. It averred that defendants, being citizens of other states, and acting in conjunction as special officers under the Interior Department of the United States government, were threatening to enforce within the city of Bemidji the provisions of  2139 and 2140 of the Revised Statutes of the United States and amendments thereto, and on December 9, 1910, had ordered complainants and other licensed saloon keepers in Bemidji to close their saloons and cease sales of liquor, and ship away their stock, threatening that otherwise they would destroy the stocks of liquor in the possession of complainants, on the ground that under article 7 of a treaty made on the 22d day of February, 1855, between the United States and certain bands of Chippewa Indians [10 Stat. at L. 1169], certain territory mentioned in the treaty, including what is now the city of Bemidji, was subject to the laws of the United States respecting the sale of liquors in the Indian country.\n To the bill as originally filed defendants interposed a demurrer, which was overruled, and a temporary injunction was granted. 183 Fed. 611. Thereafter, the cause was brought to final hearing upon an amended bill \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 425]\n\u00a0\n and a reamended answer, and the court, adhering to its former conclusion, rendered a final decree, as already mentioned.\n The pertinent historical facts, as deduced from the averments of the amended pleadings, are as follows: On and prior to February 22, 1855, certain bands of the Chippewa Tribe of Indians, known as the Mississippi bands and the Pillager and Lake Winnibigoshish bands, were in possession of the greater portion of the lands north of parallel 46, within the boundaries of the then territory of Minnesota. Their country constituted a wilderness, almost wholly uninhabited by civilized people. On the date mentioned, these bands entered into a treaty with the United States, which was approved by the Senate and proclaimed by the President shortly thereafter (10 Stat. at L. 1165). By its first article the Indians ceded and conveyed to the United States 'all their right, title, and interest in and to the lands now owned and claimed by them, in the territory of Minnesota, and included within the following boundaries.' [Here follows a particular description, by natural boundaries, of a tract of country said to contain about 21,000 square miles.] By the same article the Indians further relinquished and conveyed to the United States any and all right, title, and interest, of whatsoever nature, that they then had in and to any other lands in the territory of Minnesota or elsewhere. This article mentions no exception or reservation from the lands ceded or granted. By article II. there was 'reserved and set apart a sufficient quantity of land for the permanent homes of the said Indians; the lands so reserved and set apart to be in separate tracts, as follows.' The separate tracts were then briefly described or indicated. For the Mississippi bands six reservations were set apart, which came to be known as the Mille Lac, Rabbit Lake, Gull Lake, Pokagomon Lake, Sandy Lake, and Rice Lake Reservations; and besides these, a section of land was \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 426]\n\u00a0\n reserved for one of the Indian chiefs. For the Pillager and Lake Winnibigoshish bands, three reservations were set apart, known from their respective locations as the Leech Lake, Lake Winnibigoshish, and Cass Lake Reservations.\n The seventh article of the treaty is as follows:\n'Article 7. The laws which have been or may be enacted by Congress, regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, to continue and be in force within and upon the several reservations provided for herein; and those portions of said laws which prohibit the introduction, manufacture, use of, and traffic in, ardent spirits, wines, or other liquors, in the Indian country, shall continue and be in force, within the entire boundaries of the country herein ceded to the United States, until otherwise provided by Congress.'\n\n By act of February 26, 1857 (11 Stat. at L. 166, chap. 60), the inhabitants of a portion of the territory, including the lands ceded by the Chippewas as above, were authorized to form a state government and come into the Union on an equal footing with the original states. The act contained no condition with reference to the treaty of 1855 or the rights of the Indians to any lands within the boundaries of the state. A state Constitution was formed, by which Indians were given the right to vote under certain circumstances, and persons residing on Indian lands were declared entitled to enjoy the rights and privileges of citizens as though they lived in any other portion of the state, and to be subject to taxation. This Constitution having been ratified and adopted by the people, Congress, by act of May 11, 1858 (11 Stat. at L. 285, chap. 31), admitted the state 'on an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatever.' And by  3 it was enacten that all the laws of the United States, not locally inapplicable, should have the same force and effect within that state as in other states of the Union. \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 427]\n\u00a0\n Another treaty was made between the Mississippi, Pillager, and Lake Winnibigoshish bands of Chippewas and the United States under date May 7, 1864, which was ratified and proclaimed in the following year, and is known as the treaty of 1865 (13 Stat. at L. 693). It took the place of a treaty of March 11, 1863 (12 Stat. at L. 1249). By its 1st section the Gull Lake, Mille Lac, Sandy Lake, Rabbit Lake, Pokagomon Lake, and Rice Lake Reservations, as described in the treaty of 1855, were ceded to the United States, with an exception not now pertinent; and in consideration of this cession, the United States agreed to set apart for the future home of the Chippewas of the Mississippi a considerable tract of land (part of the great tract ceded in 1855), embraced within designated boundaries, expressly excepting, however, the reservations made in the treaty of 1855 for the Pillager and Lake Winnibigoshish bands, which were included within the boundaries mentioned. The lands thus set apart for the Chippewas of the Mississippi contained all the territory now within the limits of the city of Bemidji and the lands adjacent to it for a distance of several miles in all directions.\n By a treaty made between the United States and the Chippewas of the Mississippi, dated March 19, 1867, ratified and proclaimed in the same year (16 Stat. at L. 719,) these bands ceded to the United States the greater portion (estimated at 2,000,000 acres) of the lands secured to them by the treaty of 1865, and in consideration of this cession, the United States set apart for the use of the same Indians a tract to be located in a square form as nearly as possible, with lines corresponding to the government surveys, the reservation to include White Earth Lake and Rice Lake, and to contain thiry-six townships. This reservation came to be known as the White Earth Reservation. It lies within the exterior boundaries of the cession of 1855\n\n\n The territory ceded to the United States by the treaty \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 428]\n\u00a0\n of 1867 contains what is now the city of Bemidji and the country about it for miles in every direction.\n By an act of January 14, 1889, known as the Nelson act (25 Stat. at. L. 642, chap. 24), the President was authorized to designate commissioners to negotiate with all the different bands of Chippewa Indians in Minnesota for the complete cession and relinquishment of their title and interest in all their reservations, except the White Earth and Red Lake Reservations, and in so much of these two reservations as, in the judgment of the Commission, was not required to make and fill the allotments required by this and existing acts. The act provided that a census should be taken, and that after the cession and relinquishment had been approved, all the Chippewa Indians in the state, except those on the Red Lake Reservation, should be removed to the White Earth Reservation, and lands should then be allotted to the Indians in severalty, in conformity with the act of February 8, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 388, chap. 119), and the surplus lands disposed of by sale, and the proceeds placed in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of all the Chippewa Indians in the state of Minnesota as a permanent fund, to bear interest payable annually for fifty years, and at the end of that period the fund to be divided and paid to all of said Chippewas, and their issue then living, in cash. By the 1st section of this act the acceptance and approval of the cession and relinquishment of the lands by the President of the United States was to be deemed full and ample proof of the assent of the Indians, and to operate as a complete extinguishment of the Indian title without further act or ceremony. Commissioners were appointed accordingly, and agreements were entered into between them and the several bands of Chippewas, by which the Indians accepted and ratified the provisions of the act, and ceded to the United States all their right, title, and interest in their reservations, excepting portions of \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 429]\n\u00a0\n the White Earth and Red Lake Reservations, and these cessions were approved by the President on the 4th day of March, 1890.\n Since the making of the treaty of 1855 the country then ceded to the United States, with the exception of the portions set apart as Indian Reservations, has been largely developed, gradually at first, but with great rapidity during recent years, and all the land has become populated by white people, and opened up to settlement, and organized as political subdivisions of the state, and in the larger portion of the territory industries have been established and commercial interests have grown up, so as to materially change the situation that existed at the time of the making of the treaty. According to the census of 1910, the counties affected by that treaty show a total white population of 382,191. Bemidji is the county seat of Beltrami county, and is a municipal corporation, organized under the laws of the state as a city, containing within its corporate limits about 7,000 inhabitants, and, in connection with adjacent municipalities, constituting a pupulation of about 9,000 people. The city is reached by five lines of railroads, three of which have transcontinental connections. The country surrounding it is highly developed, and there are no Indian habitations within 20 miles in any direction from the city.\n The original Red Lake Indian Reservation lay immediately north of the great tract covered by the cession of 1855, and was not subject to the treaty of that year. Pursuant to the Nelson act of January 14, 1889, a considerable portion of this reservation was relinquished to the United States, and has been opened up to settlement, with the result that there is now a strip of territory about 15 miles in width, lying a few miles north of Bemidji, which is admittedly exempt from the provisions of any treaty or law relative to the introduction of intoxicating liquors in the Indian country; and in that strip the sale of intoxi- \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 430]\n\u00a0\n cating liquors is actually conducted without interference on the part of the government of the United States.\n Assistant Attorney General Wallace for appellants.\n\n\n[234 U.S. 422, 432]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles P. Spooner, John C. Spooner, Marshall A. Spooner, Joseph P. Cotton, and Fred W. Zollman for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Pitney: \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 433]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n This direct appeal is taken under  238, Judicial Code (act of March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 228), which allows such an appeal (inter alia) 'in any case that involves the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States; in any case in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States, or the validity or construction of any treaty made under its authority, is drawn in question.' Our jurisdiction is invoked upon three grounds: (a) that the construction or validity of article 7 of the treaty of 1855 [10 Stat. at L. 1169] is drawn in question; (b) that the construction or application of the Constitution is \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 434]\n\u00a0\n involved; (c) that the construction of the treaties of 1865 and 1867 [13 Stat. at L. 693, 16 Stat. at L. 719] is drawn in question. There is a motion to dismiss, based upon the ground that none of these contentions is well founded. We think the motion must be denied. The court below, in overruling the demurrer, based its decision upon the ground that the treaty of 1855 was necessarily repealed by the admission of the state of Minnesota into the Union upon an equal footing with the original states. This decision was based upon the bill as originally framed, but the amendments made no change affecting this ground of decision; and it is evident from the record that, in granting the final decree, the court adhered to the view expressed in overruling the demurrer. It is insisted by appellants, with some force, that this view was based upon grounds that involved the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States; and that for this reason the direct appeal lies. We find it unnecessary to consider the point, since it seems to us that the entire case for complainants rests at bottom upon grounds that involve the construction of the three treaties referred to, especially that of 1855.\n The bill, either in its original or its amended form, did not expressly assert as a ground for relief that the treaty of 1855 had been repealed, in whole or in part, by the admission of the state. On the contrary, relief was prayed upon the ground that the second clause of article 7 (that which related to the liquor traffic, and was to remain in force until otherwise provided by Congress) applied only to the ceded territory, and not to the reservations set apart within that territory; that by the treaty of 1865 those reservations were ceded to the United States, and ceased to be Indian country in any sense; and that by the subsequent cession in the treaty of 1867 the reservation of 1865 in turn was vested in the United States, and therefore ceased to be Indian country; and finally, that article 7 of the treaty of 1855 had expired at the time of \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 435]\n\u00a0\n the acts complained of in the bill (1910) by virtue of the provisions of the act of January 14, 1889, and the cessions made to the United States by the Chippewas of Minnesota pursuant to that act, and because of the changes wrought by time in the character of the territory included in the treaty of 1855, and the status of the Indians therein. These grounds of relief are reiterated in the amended bill, and the averments of the amended answer are calculated to meet them. And the principal force of the arguments on both sides is addressed to the construction of the several treaties referred to. For this reason, if for no other, the direct appeal is well taken.\n Upon the merits, we may well begin with the disputed portion of the treaty of 1855:\n'Article 7. The laws which have been or may be enacted by Congress, regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, to continue and be in force within and upon the several reservations provided for herein; and those portions of said laws which prohibit the introduction, manufacture, use of, and traffic in, ardent spirits, wines, or other liquors, in the Indian country shall continue and be in force, within the entire boundaries of the country herein ceded to the United States, until otherwise provided by Congress.'\n\n The reference to previous laws clearly points to the act of June 30, 1834, entitled, 'An Act to Regulate Trade and Intercourse with the Indian Tribes, and to Preserve Peace on the Frontiers' (4 Stat. at L. 729, chap. 161), and kindred acts. The act of 1834 was a revision of previous enactments, and contains many provisions for the regulation of trade and intercourse. Its 20th and 21st sections (4 Stat. at L. 732, chap. 161) prohibit the introduction or manufacture of, or traffic in, spirituous liquor or wine within the Indian country. From them,  2139, 2140, and 2141, Rev. Stat. were derived.\n By the 1st section of the act of 1834, the term 'Indian \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 436]\n\u00a0\n country' was defined, for the purposes of that act, as meaning land to which the Indian title had not been extinguished. At the making of the treaty, therefore, the restriction respecting the liquor traffic was in force within the ceded area, because until then the Indian title had not been extinguished. It was the evident purpose of article 7 to continue the restriction in force in the ceded territory, notwithstanding the extinguishment of the Indian title. Such stipulations were not unusal. A contemporaneous treaty with the Winnebagoes contained a similar one. 10 Stat. at L. 1174, art. 8. And it has been uniformly recognized that such stipulations amount in effect to an amendment of the statute, so as to make the restriction effective throughout the ceded territory. United States v. 43 Gallons of Whisky (United States v. Lariviere) \n93 \nU.S. 188, 196\n, 23 S. L. ed. 846, 847; Bates v. Clark, \n95 \nU.S. 204, 208\n, 24 S. L. ed. 471, 472.\n The fundamental contention that underlies the entire argument for complainants is that the first part of article 7 had for its object that the laws of Congress, present and future, regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, were to continue and be in force within the reservations created by the treaty; while the latter portion of the article had for its object to keep in force in the ceded country-which, it is said, excludes the reservations-those portions of the laws that prohibit the introduction, manufacture, use of, and traffic in ardent spirits, etc., in the Indian country until otherwise provided by Congress; the particular insistence being that the latter clause applies merely to the so-called ceded territory, and not to the lands included within the reservations.\n With this construction of the treaty we cannot agree. We think it rests upon a misconception of the fair import of the terms employed in article 7, whether considered alone or together with the context, and fails to give due effect to the reason and spirit of the stipulation.\n It seems to us that in the qualifying clause-'within \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 437]\n\u00a0\n the entire boundaries of the country herein ceded to the United States'- the words 'entire boundaries' are equivalent to 'outer boundaries,' and therefore include the reservations that lie within. And this agrees with the context; for, if we turn back to see what is 'herein ceded,' we find that by the terms of article 1 the cession is of all the right, title, and interest of the Indians in the lands owned and claimed by them, included within designated boundaries (this being the great tract in question), and then, in a separate clause, a relinquishment and conveyance of all right, title, and interest of the Indians in any other lands in the territory of Minnesota or elsewhere. There is here no suggestion that the reservations are excepted out of the cession. On the contrary, article 1 in terms vests the Indian title in the United States as to all the described lands, including the reservations mentioned in Article 2. The latter article reserves a number of comparatively small and isolated tracts 'for the permanent homes of the said Indians.' Of these, all are within the outer boundaries of the cession excepting the Mille Lac Reservation, which lies outside. Reading the two articles together, it is evident that the framers of the treaty intended that the reservations themselves should become the property of the United States, subject only to a trust for the occupancy of the Indians. This is placed beyond controversy when we observe that by the latter part of article 2 it was provided that the President of the United States might cause the reservations or portions thereof to be surveyed; assign a reasonable quantity, not exceeding 80 acres in any case, to each head of a family or single person over twenty-one years of age for his or their separate use; issue patents for the tracts so assigned, which tracts were to be exempt from taxation, levy, sale, or forfeiture, and not to be aliened or leased for a longer period than two years at one time, unless otherwise provided by the legislature of the state with the \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 438]\n\u00a0\n assent of Congress; not to be sold or aliened in fee for a period of five years after the date of patent, and not then without the assent of the President; and that, prior to the issue of the patents, the President might make rules and regulations respecting the disposition of the lands in case of the death of the allottee, etc.\n The subdivision of the reservations, allotments to individual Indians, and the ultimate alienation of allotments, being thus in view at the making of the treaty, it is unreasonable to give such a construction to the stipulation contained in the second portion of article 7 as would defeat its object, by removing the restriction from scattered parcels of land whenever it should come to pass that the Indian title therein was extinguished. The restriction would be of little force unless it covered the entire ceded area en bloc, so that no change in the situation of the reservations by way of extinguishing the residue of Indian title or otherwise should operate to limit its effect. And so, upon the whole, we deem it manifest that the second clause of article 7 dealt with the entire ceded country, including the reservations, as country proper to be subjected to the laws relating to the introduction, etc., of liquor into the Indian country until otherwise provided by Congress. It was evidently contemplated that the bands of Indians, while making their permanent homes within the reservations, would be at liberty to roam and to hunt throughout the entire country, as before. The purpose was to guard them from all temptation to use intoxicating liquors.\n That it is within the constitutional power of Congress to prohibit the manufacture, introduction, or sale of intoxicants upon Indian lands, including not only lands reserved for their special occupancy, but also lands outside of the reservations, to which they may naturally resort, and that this may be done even with respect to lands lying within the bounds of a state, are propositions so \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 439]\n\u00a0\n thoroughly established, and upon grounds so recently discussed, that we need merely cite the cases. Perrin v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 478, 483\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 387; United States v. 43 Gallons of Whisky ( United States v. Lariviere) \n93 \nU.S. 188, 195\n, 197 S., 23 L. ed. 846, 848; Dick v. United States, \n208 U.S. 340\n, 52 L. ed. 520, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 399.\n And we cannot agree with the District Court that article 7 of the treaty of 1855 was repealed by the Minnesota enabling act, or by the admission of that state into the Union upon equal terms with the other states. Neither the enabling act nor the act of admission contains any reference to the treaty, although the latter was so recent that it can hardly have been overlooked. The court seems to have considered that the continued existence of article 7, so far as it prohibited the introduction, manufacture, and sale of liquors within the ceded country outside of the reservations, was inconsistent with the 'equal footing' clause of the enabling and admitting acts. That there is no such inconsistency results very plainly, as we think, from the reasoning and authority of the cases above cited. The court deemed that United States v. 43 Gallons of Whisky ( United States v. Lariviere) \n93 \nU.S. 188, 196\n, 23 S. L. ed. 846, 847, and Dick v. United States, \n208 U.S. 340\n, 52 L. ed. 520, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 399, were distinguishable upon the ground that in each of those cases the treaty under consideration was made after the state had been admitted into the Union. But if the making of such a treaty after the admission of the state is not inconsistent with the 'equal footing' of that state with the others,-as, of course, it is not,-it seems to us to result that there is nothing in the effect of 'equal footing' clauses to operate as an implied repeal of such a treaty when previously established.\n In Ex parte Webb, \n225 U.S. 663\n, 56 L. ed. 1248, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 769, we had to deal with the effect of the Oklahoma enabling act upon a previous statute (act of March 1, 1895, chap. 145,  8, 28 Stat. at L. 693 ), which prohibited (inter alia) the 'carrying into said [Indian] terri- \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 440]\n\u00a0\n tory any of such liquors or drinks,' in view of the fact that the enabling act itself required that the Constitution of the new state should prohibit the manufacture, sale, or otherwise furnishing of intoxicating liquors within that part of the state formerly known as the Indian territory; and we held that in view of the existing treaties between the United States and the Five Civilized Tribes, and because the enabling act and the Constitution established thereunder dealt only with the prohibition of the liquor traffic within the bounds of the new state, the act of 1895 remained in force so far as pertained to the carrying of liquor from without the new state into that part of it which was the Indian territory.\n In United States v. Wright, \n229 U.S. 226\n, 57 L. ed. 1160, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 630, we held that the prohibition against the introduction of intoxicating liquors into the Indian country, found in  2139, Rev. Stat., as amended by the acts of July 23, 1892, chap. 234, 27 Stat. at L. 260, and January 30, 1897, chap. 109, 29 Stat. at L. 506, was not repealed, with respect to intrastate transactions, by the Oklahoma enabling act, in spite of the provision respecting internal prohibition contained therein, as already mentioned.\n Upon the whole, we have no difficulty in concluding that article 7 of the treaty of February 22, 1855, was not repealed by the admission of Minnesota into the Union.\n We come, therefore, to the principal contention of complainants and appellees. which is that the article was repealed by the effect of the treaties of 1865 and 1867. The argument in support of this contention may be outlined as follows: that by the earliest of the three treaties the several bands of Indians ceded to the United States the great tract of approximately 21,000 square miles, but excepted from that cession the several reservations created for the Mississippi bands and for the Pillager and Lake Winnibigoshish bands; that when the treaty of 1865 was \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 441]\n\u00a0\n made, the Mississippi bands were the owners of their reservations within the exterior limits of the cession of 1855, which reservations were not covered by the second portion of article 7, but were subject to all of the laws of the United States regulating commerce and intercourse with the Indian tribes, simply because of being Indian country in fact; that by the treaty of 1865 the Mississippi bands ceded outright to the United States these reservations, and in return the United States ceded to them the tract of territory already mentioned (including Bemidji and the country surrouding it), excepting those portions included within the reservations of the Pillager and Lake Winnibigoshish bands; and that when, in 1867, in return for the White Earth Reservation, the Mississippi Chippewas receded to the United States the greater portion of the tract set apart for them in 1865, they ceded the same title and the same right and power over the lands that the three original tribes would have had; that is to say, they ceded them free and clear of article 7 of the treaty of 1855.\n It will at once be observed that the argument rests at bottom upon the erroneous construction to which we have already called attention; viz., that the second portion of article 7 did not apply to the reservations that were within the exterior limits of the ceded territory. We repeat that, in our opinion, the restriction applied to all the territory that was included within the terms of the cession; as much to those portions set apart for reservations as to the surrounding territory. There was nothing in the treaty of 1865, therefore, to make the receded reservations unrestricted territory; nor was there anything in the treaty of 1867 to remove the restriction from the territory then receded. Reading the series of treaties together, it is plain enough, we think, that the contracting parties, in all that was done, were resting upon the plain language of the second part of article 7, which declared that the laws relat- \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 442]\n\u00a0\n ing to the introduction, etc., of liquor in the Indian country, should continue in force within the entire boundaries of the country in question until otherwise provided by Congress.\n Finally, it is contended that article 7 of the treaty of 1855 had been superseded at the time of the acts complained of in the bill (1910) by virtue of the provisions of the Nelson act of January 14, 1889 (25 Stat. at L. 642, chap. 24), and the cessions made to the United States by the Indians pursuant to that act, and by reason of the change in the character of the territory included in the treaty of 1855 and the status of the Indians therein.\n As already pointed out, this act provided that commissioners to be appointed by the President should negotiate with the different bands of Chippewas in the state of Minnesota for the complete cession and relinquishment of their title and interest in all their reservations in the state, except so much of the White Earth and Red Lake Reservations as was not required for allotments, and that acceptance and approval of such cession and relinquishment by the President should be deemed full and ample proof of the cession, and should operate as a complete extinguishment of the Indian title without other or further act or ceremony.\n From the averments of the amended bill and answer it is not easy to gather a precise statement of the present situation of the Indian lands and of the Indians themselves, so far as it affects the question before us. Some reference is made to the situation at the Red Lake Reservation; but since it is not clear that the restriction contained in the treaty of 1855 was intended for the protection of the Indians within that reservation, we prefer to confine our attention to the situation as it existed in 1910 within the boundaries of the great tract that was the subject of the cession of 1855. Within those bounds there would seem to be remaining only fragments of the White Earth \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 443]\n\u00a0\n and Leech Lake Reservations; both reservations being in process of allotment under the acts of February 8, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 388, chap. 119), and of January 14, 1889 (25 Stat. at L. 642, chap. 24), and amendatory acts. Of the lands that have been allotted, a considerable portion are still held in fee by the United States, and are nonalienable by the allottees until the expiration of the trust period. Upon the White Earth Reservation, and also at Leech Lake, the government maintains an Indian agency and superintendent, as well as Indian schools. At the White Earth agency, 5,600 Indians are carried upon the annuity rolls; at Leech Lake, 1,750 Indians. The majority of these reside upon lands embraced within the original reservation, and they are the same Indians, or descendants of the same, that were parties to the treaties of 1855, 1865, and 1867. In consequence of their elevation to the plane of citizenship by the operation of the allotment acts, tribal relations have, for most purposes, ceased to exist, but are recognized for the purpose of the distribution of annuities under the Nelson act. And it is admitted that for purposes of business, pleasure, hunting, travel, and other diversions, these Indians traverse parts of the region comprised in the cession of 1855, outside of the reservations, and thus visit the towns, villages, and cities in the territory, including Bemidji. On the other hand it is admitted that their visits to Bemidji are infrequent, and that there are no Indian habitations within a range of 20 miles in any direction from that city. And, as pointed out in the prefatory statement, the diminished Red Lake Reservation is admittedly surrounded by a strip of land, approximately 15 miles in width, which never was subject to the treaty of 1855, and upon which saloons are maintained in close proximity to that reservation. This strip extends along the northerly boundary of the cession of 1855, which is perhaps 10 or 12 miles north of Bemidiji.\n The argument for treating the restriction of 1855 as no \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 444]\n\u00a0\n longer in force rests not upon any denial of the fact that there are some thousands of Indians at the White Earth and Leech Lake Agencies, who are still more or less under the guardianship of the government, and for whose protection the liquor restriction ought to be maintained, but rather upon the fact that these Indians are surrounded by territory in which liquor is lawfully obtainable. In support of this, it is said that the former Mississippi reservations ceded to the United states in 1865 are unrestricted territory; that so much of the Leech Lake and Lake Winnibigoshish Reservations as were conveyed to the United States in 1890 are such territory; that every allotment from either of these reservations as to which the trust period has expired is such territory, and that land sold to white men in the reservations is such territory. It will be observed, again, that each of these contentions rests upon the fundamental error that the reservations mentioned in the treaty of 1855 are not within the liquor restriction of article 7.\n In view of the interpretation we have placed upon that article, it seems to us that the contention as to changed conditions must be based not upon the supposed fact that the tract covered by the cession of 1855 'is already dotted with wet territory,' but rather upon the question whether the restriction-entered into more than half a century ago, when the country was a wilderness-ought to be treated as still in force, in view of the small number of Indians entitled to protection, as compared with the large population of whites who now form the great majority of the inhabitants, and in view of the high state of civilization and development of the territory in question.\n In Perrin v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 478, 486\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 387, we had to deal with a somewhat similar question. That was a review of a conviction for unlawfully selling intoxicating liquors upon ceded lands formerly included in the Yank- \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 445]\n\u00a0\n ton Sioux Indian Reservation in the state of South Dakota. The reservation was created in 1858, and originally embraced 400,000 acres. A considerable part of it was allotted in severalty to members of the tribe under the act of 1887, the allotments being in small tracts scattered through the reservation. By an agreement ratified and confirmed by Congress August 15, 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 286, 314, chap. 290), the tribe ceded and relinquished to the United States all the unallotted lands, and by article 17 of the agreement it was stipulated: 'No intoxicating liquors nor other intoxicants shall ever be sold or given away upon any of the lands by this agreement ceded and sold to the United States, nor upon any other lands within or comprising the reservations of the Yankton Sioux or Dakota Indians as described in the treaty between the said Indians and the United States, dated April 19th, 1858 [11 Stat. at L. 743], and as afterwards surveyed and set off to the said Indians. The penalty for the violation of this provision shall be such as Congress may prescribe in the act ratifying this agreement.' In the ratifying act a penalty was prescribed. The ceded lands were opened to disposition under the homestead and town- site laws, and passed largely into private ownership, and the place at which the intoxicating Liquors were sold was within the defendant's own premises in a town located upon a part of the ceded lands held in private ownership by the inhabitants, none of whom was an Indian. After overruling the contention that the restriction was invalid because the power to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors upon all ceded lands rested exclusively in the state (citing United States v. 43 Gallons of Whisky [ United States v. Lariviere], \n93 U.S. 188\n, 23 L. ed. 846, and Dick v. United States, \n208 U.S. 340\n, 52 L. ed. 520, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 399), the opinion dealt with the further contention that the power of Congress was necessarily limited to what was reasonably essential to the protection of Indians occupying the unceded lands, and that this limitation was transcended by the provision in \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 446]\n\u00a0\n question because it embraced territory greatly in excess of what the situation required, and because its operation was not confined to a designated period reasonable in duration, but apparently was intended to be perpetual. As to this the court said (p. 486):\n'As the power is incident only to the presence of the Indians and their status as wards of the government, it must be conceded that it does not go beyond what is reasonably essential to their protection, and that, to be effective, its exercise must not be purely arbitrary, but founded upon some reasonable basis. Thus, a prohibition like that now before us, if covering an entire state when there were only a few Indian wards in a single county, undoubtedly would be condemned as arbitrary. And a prohibition valid in the beginning doubtless would become inoperative when, in regular course, the Indians affected were completely emancipated from Federal guardianship and control. A different view in either case would involve an unjustifiable encroachment upon a power obviously residing in the state. On the other hand, it must also be conceded that, in determining what is reasonably essential to the protection of the Indians, Congress is invested with a wide discretion, and its action, unless purely arbitrary, must be accepted and given full effect by the courts.'\n\n Although the circumstances of the present case are different, and we are here dealing with a question of obsolescence rather than of original invalidity, the language just quoted indicates the point of view from which the question should be approached. But we must not forget that the question is one, primarily, for the consideration of the law-making body; nor are we in danger of doing so, since, by the very terms of the stipulation now under consideration, the prohibition of the liquor traffic was to continue 'until otherwise provided by Congress.' We do not mean to say that if it appeared that no considerable \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 447]\n\u00a0\n number of Indians remained wards of the government within the territory in question, the courts would not be justified in declaring that, since the constitutional warrant for the restriction no longer existed, the restriction must expire with it. But where the question confessedly turns not upon a total, nor even upon an approximately complete, emancipation of the Indians from the Federal guardianship, but upon their unimportance as compared with the interests of the population at large, we think the question is legislative rather than judicial.\n Indeed, it has only recently been under consideration by Congress. On February 17, 1911 (Senate Doc. No. 824, 61st Cong., 3d Sess., vol. 85), the President, in a special message, called attention to the situation in Minnesota, resulting from the operation of the old Indian treaties under present conditions; and with respect to the area ceded by the Chippewas in 1855, he stated: 'The records of the Indian Bureau show that there are within said area, under the jurisdiction of the superintendents of the White Earth and Leech Lake Reservations, 7,196 Indians who can be amply protected by limiting the territory as to which said treaty provisions shall remain in force and effect to the area within and contiguous to said reservations, particularly described as follows: . . . I therefore recommend that Congress modify the article of said treaty quoted above so as to exclude from the operations of its provisions all of the territory ceded by said treaty to the United States, except that immediately above described.'\n That Congress has not yet acted upon this recommendation is evidence that the problem is not so entirely obvious of solution that it can be judicially declared to be beyond the range of legislative discretion.\n Since it must be admitted that complainants have no ground of relief against defendants if the restriction remains in force at Bemidji, as we hold that it does, it follows \n\n[234 U.S. 422, 448]\n\u00a0\n that the decree of the District Court should be reversed, and the cause remanded with directions to dismiss the bill.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice McKenna and Mr. Justice Lurton dissent upon grounds expressed in the opinion of the District Court, reported in 183 Fed. 611. \n\nFootnotes\n Leave granted on June 22, 1914, to present petition for rehearing within sixty days. \n\n\n\n\n","106":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJONES v. JONES(1914)\nNo. 339\nArgued: April 30, 1914Decided: June 22, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. W. H. Harrelson and W. P. Metcalf for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. B. F. Booth for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a question of collateral descent arising under the Tennessee statutes. \n\n[234 U.S. 615, 616]\n\u00a0\n One John Jones, a colored freedman, died in 1889, the owner of a tract of 87 acres of land lying in Shelby county, Tennessee, upon which he and his wife had lived for many years. He died intestate and without issue. The title to the land was claimed by his widow, the defendant in error, Marguerite Jones, who has, since the death of John Jones, intermarried with the other defendant in error, Albert Jones. Her claim was rested upon  4165, Shannon's Compilation of Tennessee Laws, which provides that if one die intestate, 'leaving no heir at law capable of inheriting the real estate, it shall be inherited by the husband or wife in fee simple.' The plaintiff in error, Will Jones, contested the claim of the widow, contending that the land passed to the surviving brothers and sisters of the intestate, under whom, through quitclaim deeds, he claimed the title. The widow's bill was for the purpose of canceling these deeds as clouds upon her title. The Tennessee court sustained her bill and adjudged that the intestate having died without issue, and without heirs at law capable of inheriting, his real estate passed to his widow under  4165, supra.\n The deeds denounced as clouds upon the widow's title were attacked upon a number of grounds, among them fraud in their procuration. The decree ordering their cancelation was apparently based only upon the ground that their makers, assuming them to be legitimate full brothers and sisters of the intestate John Jones, were sons and daughters of a born slave and themselves born slaves, and as such were not his heirs within the meaning of the Tennessee statutes of descent.\n There is a Tennessee statute of descent which provides that the land of an intestate shall pass to his brothers and sisters in case the owner die without issue, and the contention is that if this statute preferring the brothers and sisters of an intestate dying without issue over the husband or widow be construed as applying only to brothers and \n\n[234 U.S. 615, 617]\n\u00a0\n sisters born free, it discriminates against those born slaves, and thereby violates that equal protection of the law guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.\n This provision of the Tennessee canon of descent by which the brothers and sisters of an intestate dying without issue take his real estate is as old as the state, and comes from the common law. It does not distinguish in terms between brothers and sisters born free and those born slaves. Neither does it distinguish between those who are born bastards and those born in wedlock, and those who are aliens and those who are not. Nevertheless, neither a bastard nor an alien has inheritable blood, nor are they capable of inheriting as heirs unless by aid of some statute: 2 Kent, Com. *211; 2 Bl. Com. *249; Levy v. M'Cartee, 6 Pet. 102, 8 L. ed. 334. The civil status of slaves in Tennessee, as well as in other states in which slavery existed, was such as to disable them from inheriting or transmitting property by descent. Thus it was said: 'They cannot take property by descent or purchase, and all they find and all they hold belongs to the master. They cannot make lawful contracts, and they are deprived of civil rights. They are assets in the hands of executors for the payment of debts.' 2 Kent, Com. 11th ed. 278, *253; Jackson ex dem. People v. Lervey, 5 Cow. 397. Slaves, therefore, were not within the meaning and effect of the statutes of descent, and no descent from or through a slave was possible except as provided by some special statute. The rule was the same as to aliens and illegitimates.\n After the emancipation of the slaves of the South the statutes of inheritance were extended in many states so as to confer upon the children of parents born in slavery the right to inherit from their parents. But these enlargements of the canon of descent extended only to lineal descendants and did not embrace collaterals. The Ten- \n\n[234 U.S. 615, 618]\n\u00a0\n nessee statute, which was claimed in the court below to be broad enough to embrace collateral relatives, is that of 1865-66, chap. 40,  5, carried into Shannon's Compilation as  4179. That act declared that slaves who, within the state, had lived together as man and wife, should be regarded as lawfully married, and that the children of such slave marriages should be 'legitimately entitled to an inheritance in any property heretofore acquired or that may be hereafter acquired, to as full an extent as children of white citizens are entitled by the laws of this state.' But this statute has been more than once construed as not extending the right of inheritance beyond the lineal descendants of the parents. Shepherd v. Carlin, 99 Tenn. 64, 41 S. W. 340; Carver v. Maxwell, 110 Tenn. 75, 71 S. W. 752. In Shepherd v. Carlin, supra, the question here presented was decided. Agnes Lee, a colored woman, born in slavery, died intestate and without issue. Her land was claimed by her surviving husband under  4165, Shannon's Compilation, heretofore referred to, and by her niece as her only collateral relative. The court held that the right to inherit the real estate of an intestate born in slavery had been extended only in favor of lineal descendants, and that collaterals possessed no inheritable blood. To the same effect are many cases, among them: Tucker v. Bellamy, 98 N. C. 31, 4 S. E. 34; Jones v. Hoggard, 108 N. C. 178, 12 S. E. 906, 907; Williams v. Kimball, 35 Fla. 49, 26 L.R.A. 746, 48 Am. St. Rep. 238, 16 So. 783.\n Inheritance is governed by the lex rei sitae. It is not a natural or absolute right, but the creation of statute law. If one claim the right to succeed to the real property of another as heir, and his right is denied because he must trace his pedigree or title to or through an alien, a bastard, or a slave, the question is one to be determined by the local law. Cope v. Cope, \n137 U.S. 682\n, 34 L. ed. 832, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 222; Levy v. M'Cartee, supra; Blythe v. Hinckley, \n180 U.S. 333\n, 45 L. ed. 557, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 390. In Levy v. M'Cartee, supra, the question was one of inheritance, the \n\n[234 U.S. 615, 619]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff tracing his pedigree through an alien ancestor. After first deciding that a question of inheritance to land in New York was one to be determined by the law of that state, the court held: first, that an alien had no inheritable blood and could neither take land himself by descent, nor transmit it to others; second, that under the law of New York one citizen of the state could not inherit in the collateral line of another when he must make his pedigree or title through a deceased alien ancestor.\n It is true that the land of the intestate John Jones was acquired when he was a freedman. Under the law of the state when he acquired it, he had the right to dispose of it by deed or will. If he died intestate, leaving issue, it descended to such issue. But if he left no such descendants, it passed, by the express terms of the statute, to his widow.\n We are unable to see in the Tennessee statute of descent any such denial of the equal protection of the law as is prohibited by the 14th Amendment.\n The decree is accordingly affirmed. \n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJONES v. ST LOUIS LAND & CATTLE CO.(1914)\nNo. 203\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1914\n\n\n\n Mr. Andrieus A. Jones for appellant.[ Jones v. St Louis Land & Cattle Co. \n232 U.S. 355\n (1914) ]\n\n\n[232 U.S. 355, 357]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles A. Spiess and S. B. Davis, Jr., for appellee.\n\n\n[232 U.S. 355, 358]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n In the year 1876 this suit was instituted by William P. Beck et al. for the purpose of determining the title of the parties to what is known as the Preston Beck grant, and for a partition of the same. This grant conflicts with a certain other grant, known as the Perea grant, to the extent of about 5,000 acres. In the year 1903, Andrieus A. Jones, appellant, was appointed receiver of the Beck grant, and entered into possession of it, including the land in conflict. The St. Louis Land & Cattle Company appellee, filed an intervening petition in the cause, and set up a claim to the land in conflict and prayed as relief that the receiver be ordered to surrender to it the land claimed. Answer was filed to the petition, which, among other things, denied that the Land & Cattle Company had any right, title, or interest in the land. \n\n[232 U.S. 355, 359]\n\u00a0\n After hearing, the district court decided in favor of the receiver, and dismissed the petition in intervention. The decree was reversed by the supreme court of the territory, and this appeal was then taken.\n The question in the case is, Of which grant is the conflict land a part?\n Both grants were reported favorably by the surveyor general of the territory to Congress for confirmation, the Beck grant September 30, 1856, the Perea grant September 15, 1857. Both were confirmed by Congress in the act of June 21, 1860 (12 Stat. at L. 71, chap. 167). The act recited the fact of the recommendation for confirmation by the surveyor general of the territory of certain private land claims in the territory, and confirmed them under the numbers by which he had designated them, the Beck grant being No. 1 and the Perea grant being No. 16.\n Section 4 of the act provided 'that the foregoing confirmation shall only be construed as quitclaims or relinquishments, on the part of the United States, and shall not affect the adverse rights of any other person or persons whomsoever.'\n The arguments of counsel have taken a wide range, but we think the decision of the case can be put on a short ground. Both grants have the same Mexican source; that is, they are grants by the political chief ( governor) and the territorial deputation. The Beck grant was the prior one, its date being December, 1823; that of the Perea grant, March, 1825. Juridical possession was given of the Beck grant; it was not of the Perea grant. The Beck grant was presented for confirmation to the surveyor general of New Mexico in May, 1855, and declared valid by that officer, and a report made thereof September 30, 1856, to the Secretary of the Interior for confirmation by Congress. The Perea grant was presented for confirmation in 1857, decided to be valid, and reported to the Secretary of the Interior. Both grants, we have seen, were con- \n\n[232 U.S. 355, 360]\n\u00a0\n firmed by Congress by the same act. In 1860 the Beck grant was duly surveyed and the survey approved, and on the 13th of June, 1883, a patent was duly issued for the grant as surveyed. The survey of the Perea grant was not made until 1871. It will be observed, therefore, that the Beck grant, in all of its steps, preceded the Perea grant.\n The supreme court of New Mexico, however, was of opinion that those steps could not be considered and that both grants were invalid under the Mexican law, and took their efficacy solely from the act of Congress, and that, therefore, the parties 'holding by the same act of Congress, in so far as their grants conflict or overlap, have each an 'equal undivided moiety of the lands within the conflict,\" applying the principle of Southern P. R. Co. v. United States, \n183 U.S. 519\n, 46 L. ed. 307, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 154. In this, we think the court erred. The act of Congress was not a gratuity, it was intended to be a discharge of the obligations of the treaty between the United States and Mexico. It was a confirmation of rights which existed, and as they existed.\n The reports of the surveyor general were made under the authority of the act of Congress of 1854, which made it the duty of that officer 'to ascertain the origin, nature, character, and extent of all claims to lands under the laws, usages, and customs of Spain and Mexico.' He was required to make report thereof, 'denoting the various grades of title, with his decision as to the validity or invalidity of each of the same under the laws, usages, and customs of the country before its cession to the United States, . . . which report shall be laid before Congress for such action thereon as may be deemed just and proper, with a view to confirming bona fide grants, and give full effect to the treaty of eighteen hundred and forty-eight between the United States and Mexico,' [9 Stat. at L. 922]. 10 Stat. at L. 308, chap. 103.\n The proceedings, therefore, for the confirmation of titles \n\n[232 U.S. 355, 361]\n\u00a0\n derived from Mexico, commenced with the surveyor general, and were consummated by the confirming act, the surveyor general deciding in the first instance. The petition to him 'is the commencement of proceedings, which necessarily involve the validity of the grant from the Mexican government.' Congress, however, constituted itself the tribunal of ultimate decision of the validity or invalidity of the claim, as, of course, it might do in the discharge of the treaty obligations, or delegate that duty to the judicial department. Tameling v. United States Freehold & Emigration Co. \n93 U.S. 644\n, 23 L. ed. 998; Astiazaran v. Santa Rita Land & Min. Co. \n148 \nU.S. 80, 82\n, 84 S., 37 L. ed. 376-378, 13 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 822.\n The confirmation, therefore, cannot be dissociated from what preceded it, and it may be said of such direct confirmation by act of Congress, as has been said of confirmation through special tribunals created by Congress, that it constitutes a declaration of the validity of the claim under the Mexican laws, and that the claim is entitled to recognition and protection by the stipulations of the treaty. Beard v. Federy, 3 Wall. 478, 492, 18 L. ed. 88, 92. And if there be claims under two patents each of which reserves the rights of the other parties, the inquiry must extend to the character of the original concession. The controversy can only be settled by determining which of these two gives the better right to the demanded premises. Henshaw v. Bissell, 18 Wall. 255, 266, 21 L. ed. 835, 839.\n In Miller v. Dale, \n92 U.S. 473\n, 23 L. ed. 735, there was a conflict between a concession of the Mexican government, confirmed by the tribunals of the United States and a survey thereon, and a patent of the United States issued upon a similar confirmed concession, and the question in the case was which gave the better right to the premises. This court said: 'To answer this question, we must look into the character of the original concessions; and if they furnish no guide to the just conclusion, we must seek a \n\n[232 U.S. 355, 362]\n\u00a0\n solution in the proceedings had before our tribunals and officers by which the claims of the parties were determined.' This rule is the only just and practical one, and, besides, the act of Congress confirming the Beck and Perea grants saved to each rights against the other by  4 of the act.\n It is urged, however, that this doctrine is opposed by Dent v. Emmeger, 14 Wall, 308, 20 L. ed. 838, Les Bois v. Bramell, 4 How. 449, 11 L. ed. 1051, and the cases cited by them. In Dent v. Emmeger, it was said of grants which were described as of 'imperfect obligation, and affected only the conscience of the new sovereign,' and received from it 'a vitality and efficacy which they did not before possess,' that 'when confirmed by Congress they became American titles and took their legal validity wholly from the act of confirmation, and not from any French or Spanish element which entered into their previous existence. The doctrine of senior and junior equities and of relation back has no application in the jurisprudence of such cases.'\n Of the same character were the rights in the other cases. In some of them there were mere orders for surveys and promises of title which the new sovereign was under no obligation to yield to. In the case at bar we are dealing with rights which were recognized by the new sovereign because they were supposed to have legal validity under the old sovereign.\n It is true in the case at bar, such validity is contested, and the contest is certainly justified as to the Perea grant. It was decided in Hayes v. United States, \n170 \nU.S. 637, 644\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1174, 1177, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 735, that after it was decreed by the general constituent Congress July 6, 1824, that 'the province of New Mexico remains a territory of the federation,' the adoption by the same Congress of a general colonization law, August 18, 1824, and a permanent Constitution October 24th of the same year, the officials of the territory had no 'power to dispose of the public lands, even though it be \n\n[232 U.S. 355, 363]\n\u00a0\n arguendo conceded that such power had theretofore been possessed by the officials who exercised authority within the area which was made a territory by the Constitution.' But this only in passing. We are not called upon to consider the power of the territorial officers. The validity of the grants has been pronounced by Congress, and we are only required to consider their relation to each other and the public domain. We have seen that the Beck grant in all of its steps was prior to the Perea grant. Juridical possession was given of it before the Perea grant was applied for and the conveyance of the land embraced within its boundaries made complete. It was confirmed first by the surveyor general of the territory and surveyed first by the Interior Department, and a survey 'was necessary to its accurate segregation and delimitation.' Stoneroad v. Stoneroad, \n158 U.S. 250\n, 39 L. ed. 969, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 822.\n It follows from these views that the land in conflict is part of the Beck grant, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Territory is reversed, and the cause remanded to the Supreme Court of the state for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","108":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKANSAS CITY SOUTHERN R. CO. v. ANDERSON(1914)\nNo. 319\nArgued: March 20, 1914Decided: April 13, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 325, 326]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Samuel W. Moore, Frank H. Moore, and James B. McDonough for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 325, 327]\n\u00a0\n No brief was filed for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Error to review a judgment of the supreme court of the state, affirming a judgment by which defendant in error was awarded against plaintiff in error (herein called the railway company) double damages and attorney's fee for a mare killed by one of the railway company's trains.\n The judgment was recovered under a statute of the state which the railway company attacked in the courts below and attacks here, on the ground that it violates the due process clause of the Constitution of the United States. The statute provides that when any stock is killed or injured by railroad trains running in the state, the officers of the train shall cause the station master or overseer at the nearest station house to give notice of the fact by posting and by advertisement, and, on failure to so advertise, the owner shall recover double damages for all stock killed and not advertised. 'And said railroad shall pay the owner of such stock within thirty days after notice is served on such railroad by such owner. Failure to do so shall entitle said owner to double the amount of damages \n\n[233 U.S. 325, 328]\n\u00a0\n awarded him by any jury trying such cause, and a reasonable attorney's fee.' [Ark. Laws, 1907, p. 144.]\n If a suit be brought after the thirty days have expired, and the owner recover ' a less amount of damages than he sues for, then such owner shall recover only the amount given him by said jury, and not be entitled to recover any attorney's fee.'\n For its contention that the act offends the Constitution of the United States the railway company relies on St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Wynne, \n224 U.S. 354\n, 56 L. ed. 799, 42 L.R.A.(N.S.) 102, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493.\n In that case, however, there was a demand for $500 damages. The railway company refused to pay it. The owner sued for $400 and recovered a verdict for that amount, and the court, deeming the statute applicable, gave judgment for double that amount and an attorney's fee of $50. The supreme court sustained the judgment against the contention of the railway company that the statute so applied was repugnant to the due process clause of the Constitution of the United States. This court reversed the judgment, holding that so far as the statute was held to justify the imposition of double damages where there was demand for one sum and an action and judgment for less, it was void. The question was expressly reserved whether such would be the decision if the recovery corresponded to the demand; in other words, in the language of the opinion, 'Where the prior demand is fully established in the suit following the refusal to pay.' That question is involved in the present case, and we think it is determined by Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Seegers, \n207 U.S. 73\n, 52 L. ed. 108, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 28, and Yazoo & M. Valley R. Co. v. Jackson Vinegar Co. \n226 U.S. 217\n, 57 L. ed. 193, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 40. In both cases statutes (South Carolina and Mississippi) were sustained. Each provided for a penalty for failure to settle claims after certain time after demand, the penalty being $50 in one \n\n[233 U.S. 325, 329]\n\u00a0\n statute and in the other $25, in addition to the actual damages. In the Seegers Case it was said: 'It must be remembered that the purpose of this legislation is not primarily to enforce the collection of debts, but to compel the performance of duties which the carrier assumes when it enters upon the discharge of its public functions.' In the other case it was said, the railroad company 'has not been penalized for failing to accede to an excessive or extravagant claim, but for failing to make reasonably prompt settlement of a claim which, upon due inquiry, has been pronounced just in every respect.' In Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Polt, \n232 U.S. 165\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 301, a statute of South Dakota was passed upon which makes a railroad liable for double damages if, within sixty days after demand, it does not pay the damage actually sustained for property destroyed by fire communicated from its locomotive engine. The plaintiff in the case got a verdict for less than he demanded, but for more than the railroad offered. Judgment for double the amount of the verdict was entered and sustained by the supreme court of the state. It was reversed by this court, the ruling of the Wynne Case, supra, being applied. We said: 'The case is not like those in which a moderate penalty is imposed for failure to satisfy a demand found to be just. Yazoo & M. Valley R. Co. v. Jackson Vinegar Co. supra.'\n It is contended, however, that the statute having been declared unconstitutional as applied to one state of facts that properly raises the question, it is void for all purposes. The contention is based on the assumption that we decided the statute in the Wynne Case to be unconstitutional; but the ground of the decision was, as we have seen, that the statute was there applied to a case where the plaintiff in the action had recovered less than he demanded before suit. We declined to extend our opinion to a case where the amount of the judgment corresponded to the demand; \n\n[233 U.S. 325, 330]\n\u00a0\n in other words, declined to pronounce the act entirely unconstitutional.\n In Yazoo & M. Vally R. Co. v. Jackson Vinegar Co. supra, when urged again to extend our ruling beyond the facts and declare the Mississippi statute entirely void, we declined to do so, considering it a matter for the state court to decide 'how far parts of it might be sustained if others fail.'\n In the case at bar the supreme court of the state has limited the statute, and has, indeed, declared that it had not intended in the Wynne Case to place upon the 'statute a construction that would make it applicable to a case based upon a state of facts where a demand had been made before suit for a sum greater than that recovered upon a trial.' And, further: 'The construction and application of this statute, as made by this court, is therefore not such as to render it invalid under the decisions made by the Supreme Court of the United States.'\n It is also contended by the railway company that the statute deprives it of the equal protection of the laws in that it singles out railroads and subjects them to the payment of double damages and attorneys' fees when litigants in general are not subject to the same burdens. The contention is not tenable. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Seegers, supra.\n We do not enter into a general discussion of the police power of the state. As we said in the Polt Case, 'the states have a large latitude in the policy that they will pursue and enforce,' and we do not think that the limit of their power has been transcended in the present case.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Lamar dissent. \n\n\n\n","109":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKANSAS SOUTHERN RY. v. KAW VALLEY DIST.(1914)\nNo. 313\nArgued: Decided: April 6, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 75, 76]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Samuel W. Moore, Samuel W. Sawyer, and James M. Souby for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Thomas A. Pollock for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n These cases arise upon petitions for mandamus filed by the defendant in error, the Kaw Valley Drainage District. The allegations are that the Kansas river flows through the district, is a navigable stream, and in 1903 overflowed its banks, flooded a large part of Kansas City, Kansas, and caused great loss; that the harbor lines established by the United States and the lines for a levee along the banks established by the plaintiff substantially coincide; that the defendants respectively own bridges across the river, which, at their present elevation, cause it to overflow; and that the plaintiff, in pursuance of the power given to it by the state, has ordered the defendants respectively to raise these bridges to specified heights and to remove the old ones, which the defendants have refused to do. On these petitions alternative writs issued, and thereupon the defendants made return, each making a general denial and setting up that its railway tracks across the bridge were used in commerce among the states, and that such commerce would be cut off and destroyed by enforcement of the order, and claiming the protection of the Constitution, art. 1,  8 (cl. 3). They each alleged also that to raise the bridges would require a raising of the grades of the streets for the approaches, and that the right to raise them depended on the consent of Kansas City, which the city refused to give; that the raising would cut in two inter- \n\n[233 U.S. 75, 77]\n\u00a0\n secting tracks of other roads, that this could not be done without the consent of such roads, which they also refused; that the raising would do permanent damage to private property abutting on the streets that would have to be raised, and that the plaintiff had taken no steps to compensate the owners; that the damage to the defendant would exceed large sums mentioned; and that the plans for the new bridges have not been approved by the Secretary of War. Act of March 3, 1899, chap. 425,  9, 30 Stat. at L. 1151, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3540. Each defendant relied upon the 14th Amendment. The Terminal Company also alleged a contract with the drainage district which was thought to preclude its present requirement, and to be protected by the Constitution, article 1,  10. The cases were heard on the alternative writs and the returns, and the supreme court of the state issued peremptory writs requiring the defendants to clear the channel to specified heights. 87 Kan. 272, 123 Pac. 991.\n Motions to dismiss were presented at the last term, but were denied, as the record shows not only that rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States were specially set up and claimed, but that the questions concerning them are not of a kind to be dismissed.\n The supreme court recognized that it could not order the bridges to be raised to the required height without the authority of the Secretary of War. Therefore we may lay on one side the somewhat surprising answer made to the allegations that the consent of the city and other railroads was necessary and was refused,-the suggestion, namely, that if the defendants wanted to do it they would find some way of reaching their end. See Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Central Stock Yards Co. \n212 \nU.S. 132, 144\n, 53 S. L. ed. 441, 446, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 246. It was not suggested that the railroads had the power to reach the result by eminent domain. See Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. North Carolina Corp. Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 1, 27\n, 51 S. L. ed. 933, 945, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585, 11 Ann. Cas. 398. We lay on one side also various \n\n[233 U.S. 75, 78]\n\u00a0\n over-refined objections to the defendants' pleadings made in the argument here, saying only that we read them as alleging what they fairly would convey to an ordinarily intelligent lawyer by a fairly exact use of English speech. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 395\n, 49 S. L. ed. 518, 523, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 276. But the court went on, on the assumption that it would lead to the elevation of the bridges, and seemingly for the purpose of accomplishing indirectly what it admitted that it could not do directly, to make an unqualified absolute order, as we have said, that the defendants should clear the channel of all obstructions on their lines up to the specified heights,-in other words, to remove the bridges as they stand.\n These judgments must be taken as they read upon their face. They are not conditional orders to raise the bridge if the defendants can obtain the consent of parties not before the court, and of one authority, at least, not subject to its control. They cannot be qualified by speculation as to what is likely to happen in fact. They are out-and-out orders to remove bridges that are a necessary part of lines of commerce by rail among the states. But that subject-matter is under the exclusive control of Congress, and is not one that it has left to the states until there shall be further action on its part. The freedom from interference on the part of the states is not confined to a simple prohibition of laws impairing it, but extends to interference by any ultimate organ. It was held that under the permissive statute authorizing telegraph companies to maintain lines on the post roads of the United States a state could not stop the operation of the lines by an injunction for failure to pay taxes. Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Atty. Gen. \n125 U.S. 530\n, 31 L. ed. 790, 8 Sup. Ct. Rup. 961. Williams v. Talladega, \n226 \nU.S. 404, 415\n, 416 S., 57 L. ed. 275, 279, 280, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 116. It would seem that the same principle applies to railroads under the commerce clause of the Constitution, especially if taken in connection with the somewhat similar statute now Rev. \n\n[233 U.S. 75, 79]\n\u00a0\n Stat.  5258, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3564. And so it is held. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Wharton, \n207 \nU.S. 328, 334\n, 52 S. L. ed. 230, 234, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 121; Mississippi R. Commission v. Illinois C. R. Co. \n203 U.S. 335\n, 51 L. ed. 209, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 90.\n The decisions also show that a state cannot avoid the operation of this rule by simply invoking the convenient apologetics of the police power. It repeatedly has been said or implied that a direct interference with commerce among the states could not be justified in this way. 'The state can do nothing which will directly burden or impede the interstate traffic of the company, or impair the usefulness of its facilities for such traffic.' Illinois C. R. Co. v. Illinois, \n163 \nU.S. 142, 154\n, 41 S. L. ed. 107, 111, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1096; Austin v. Tennessee, \n179 \nU.S. 343, 349\n, 45 S. L. ed. 224, 228, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Wharton, \n207 \nU.S. 328, 334\n, 52 S. L. ed. 230, 234, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 121. To destroy the bridges across which these railroad lines necessarily pass is at least as direct an interference with such commerce as to prohibit the importation of cattle or oleomargarin, or the export of natural gas. Hannibal & St. J. R. Co. v. Husen, \n95 U.S. 465\n, 24 L. ed. 527; Schollenberger v. Pennsylvania, \n171 U.S. 1\n, 43 L. ed. 49, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 757; West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co. \n221 \nU.S. 229, 262\n, 55 S. L. ed. 716, 729, 35 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1193, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 564. Furthermore, in the present case it is not pretended that local welfare needs the removal of the defendants' bridges at the expense of the dominant requirements of commerce with other states, but merely that it would be helped by raising them. The fact that the court cannot order them to be raised does not justify a judgment that they be destroyed even in the avowed expectation that what it wants but cannot command is all that will come to pass.\n A strong argument was made for the plaintiffs in error that they never had been allowed their day in court, as matters put in issue by them, such as the necessity of the change, were assumed against them. It was urged with seeming justice that, granting that, as was said by the court, the order of the drainage district was prima facie correct, still, when that order was challenged in the pleadings, it could not be assumed to be valid at a hearing upon \n\n[233 U.S. 75, 80]\n\u00a0\n the writs and returns. But we express no opinion upon this point or upon claims under the 14th Amendment, as what we have said sufficiently decides the cases. The argument of the terminal company upon the contract with the drainage district does not impress us. By way of compromise the Terminal Company's predecessor agreed to build a permanent bridge according to a plan, and the drainage district 'hereby consents to the construction of said permanent bridge . . . and declares that the same when constructed shall constitute a lawful structure . . . not waiving any right . . . to require the construction of an additional span.' This, coming from a board created to exercise police power, not unnaturally would be construed rather as a license than as an abdication of a continuing duty, on which we are asked to take notice that new light had been shed by a subsequent flood that has given rise to cases before this court. But, for the reasons that we have given, the judgment must be reversed.\n Judgments reversed. \n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKEOKEE CONSOL COKE CO. v.

These orders were upon scrip issued by the plaintiff in error as an advance of monthly wages in payment for labor performed, and the only controversy between the parties arises from the refusal of the plaintiff in error to pay the indicated amounts in money. The facts were agreed, the circuit court gave judgment for the plaintiffs, and a writ of error was refused by the supreme court of appeals. The ground of the judgment was an act of February 13, 1888, amending and re- enacting an act of 1887, chap. 391,  3, forbidding any person, firm, or corporation engaged in mining coal or ore, or manufacturing iron or steel or any other kind of manufacturing, to issue for the payment of labor any order unless the same purported to be redeemable for its face value in lawful money of the United States. The plaintiff in error saved its rights under the 14th Amendment, and, when the court of appeals refused to hear the cases, brought them here. The writ of error was allowed on September 25, 1912.

Rep. 828.\n Of course we do not go behind the construction given to the state law by the state courts. The objections that are urged here are that the statute interferes with freedom of contract, and, more especially, that it is class legislation \n\n[234 U.S. 224, 227]\n\u00a0\n of a kind supposed to be inconsistent with the 14th Amendment; a West Virginia decision upon a similar statute being cited to that effect. State v. Goodwill, 33 W. Va. 179, 6 L.R.A. 621, 25 Am. St. Rep. 863, 10 S. E. 285. The former of these objections, however, is disposed of by Knoxville Iron Co. v.

Rep. 5.\n It is more pressed that the act discriminates unconstitutionally against certain classes. But while there are differences of opinion as to the degree and kind of discrimination permitted by the 14th Amendment, it is established by repeated decisions that a statute aimed at what is deemed an evil, and hitting it presumably where experience shows it to be most felt, is not to be upset by thinking up and enumerating other instances to which it might have been applied equally well, so far as the court can see.

The final decree, in the parts material here, restricted the defendant to using the name 'Arthur A. Waterman & Co.' instead of 'A. A. Waterman & Co.,' and required the words 'not connected with the L. E. Waterman Co.' to be juxtaposed in equally large and conspicuous letters when the permitted name was marked upon any part of the fountain pen sold by the defendant, or upon boxes containing such pens, and whenever the name was used by way of advertisement or otherwise to denote any fountain pens made or sold by the defendant, or to denote that it was the maker or seller of such pens. 105 C.

Jascobs v. Beecham, \n221 \nU.S. 263, 274\n, 55 S. L. ed. 729, 732, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 555. Both parties appeal.\n The defendant's appeal is from the requirements that it use the name 'Arthur A. Waterman & Co.' instead of 'A. A. Waterman & Co.,' and that it juxtapose the words 'not connected with the L. E. Waterman Co.' After the finding of two courts and upon the evidence it must be assumed that the defendant had used the name Waterman in such a way as to mislead the public and to interfere with the plaintiff's rights unless the defendant had the right to use the name as matter of law, because it was the selling agent of a firm calling itself 'A. A. Waterman & Co.,' and deriving its name from a man who started in business long after the plaintiff had acquired whatever rights it has. In support of this proposition the defendant lays hold of language in Howe Scale Co. v. Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict, \n198 \nU.S. 118, 140\n, 49 S. L. ed. 972, 986, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 609, and in other books, to the effect that courts will not interfere with the use of a party's own name 'where the only confusion, if any, results from a similarity of the names, and not from the manner of the use.' But, whatever generality of expression there may have been in the earlier cases, it now is established that when the use of his own name upon his goods by a later competitor will and does lead the public to understand that those goods are the product of a concern already established and well known under that name, and when the profit of the confusion is known to, and, if that be material, is intended by, the later man, the law will require him to take reasonable precautions to prevent the mistake.

Case it was stated upon the same page \n\n[235 U.S. 88, 95]\n\u00a0\n with the passage quoted that 'defendant's name and trademark were not intended or likely to deceive.'\n The only other ground for the defendant's appeal that needs a word after the findings below is a decree of the supreme court of New York in a suit by the plaintiff against Arthur A. Waterman and Edward L. Gibson, partners doing business as the A. A. Waterman Pen Company of New York and Boston. The defendant alleges that it has succeeded to A. A. Waterman's rights. The decision found in the strongest terms that the name was used with fraudulent intent, and the decree in some detail enjoined the defendant from using that or any corporate name containing the word 'Waterman,' and from using in connection with the business of making or selling fountain pens the word 'Waterman' alone or with others in such collocation with the word 'pen' as to indicate that such pens were a variety of Waterman's fountain pens. This rather damaging decree is thought to give some help because of a following sentence to the effect that the defendants were not prohibited from indicating that their pens were made or sold for or by Arthur A. Waterman & Co. or A. A. Waterman & Co. But that sentence was subject to the previous prohibition and consistent with it. The present defendant still not only may indicate the source of its pens in undeceptive ways, but may mark them 'Arthur A. Waterman & Co.' if only it add words that prevent the fraud that it insists upon the right to effect. It is unnecessary to go into other considerations presented by the record to show that the defendant's appeal cannot be maintained.\n The plaintiff's appeal is from the failure of the decree to prohibit the use of the name 'Arthur A. Waterman & Co.' even with the suffix required by the court. The ground upon which it claims this broader relief is that the agreement with A. A. Waterman by which he purported to become a partner in the firm of A. A. Waterman & Co. \n\n[235 U.S. 88, 96]\n\u00a0\n was a sham, that the firm does not make the pens sold by the defendant, and that all the arrangements between Waterman, the firm, and the defendant were merely colorable devices to enable the defendant to get the name upon its pens. If we were to adopt this view of the facts the nature of the parties' rights and powers perhaps might need a more careful discussion than, so far as we are aware, it has received as yet. Under the decree in its present form the plaintiff gets all the protection to which it is entitled as against another Waterman who has established himself in the business, even though one of his motives for going into it was the hope of some residual advantages from the use of his own name. If with the warning that the law decrees sufficient to prevent a fraud a second Waterman could go into the business and give it his name, the question occurs whether a man might not change his name to Waterman and do the same thing; and, if so, whether the nature of the defendant's title to the name is any concern of the plaintiff,-whether, in short, the protection now granted is limited by reason of a personal privilege, or is the measure of the plaintiff's rights as against the world. We express no opinion upon the point beyond saying that it would have to be considered before the plaintiff could obtain a broader decree. For the purposes of decision we give the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt.\n Whatever view may be taken of the agreements, there is no question that they were intended, with A. A. Waterman's assent, to authorize the use of his name in a business that he had pecuniary reasons for wishing to see succeed. He purported to transfer to the partnership the good will attaching to his name. While it very well may be true that the transfer of a name without a business is not enough to entitle the transferee to prevent others from using it, it still is a license that may be sufficient to put the licensee on the footing of the licensor as against the plaintiff. Moreover, two courts have upheld the arrangements \n\n[235 U.S. 88, 97]\n\u00a0\n as effective to give the defendant the protection of such rights as A. A. Waterman would have had in establishing business after the plaintiff, and therefore we shall not go into any consideration of the facts.\n It cannot be said the partnership agreement was ineffectual for the present purpose as matter of law. The object is pretty plain, but it is none the worse for that. The leading features are as follows: A partnership is formed under the name 'A. A. Waterman & Co.' Contributions of capital are to be deemed loans and bear interest. The two partners other than Waterman have the management of the business and alone can sign negotiable paper and contracts. The business is to make, buy, and sell fountain pens, and the defendant corporation is to be formed (the parties to be interested in it), and is to be the sole selling agent of the firm. Waterman grants to the firm the exclusive use of his own and the firm names in connection with the business, and all the good will attaching to either. The continent is divided into two defined districts, and Waterman has the exclusive right to do business under the name 'A. A. Waterman & Co.' in the western district, if he begins it before July 1, 1906, and the remaining members the exclusive right to the eastern district. In any event Waterman leaves the present firm at that date. Each party has the free use of all patents, trademarks and tradenames within their territories that either party has or may acquire. Eastern territory goods are to be marked 'A. A. Waterman & Co., New York, and those made in the western, 'A. A. Waterman & Co. (or some similar name) Chicago.' Waterman covenants not to compete for thirty-six years, or to use or allow the use of his name except as provided. Finally if Waterman does not go into independent business, he is to have the exclusive agency for the western territory for the thirty-six years, and his commissions are fixed in detail and with care. \n\n[235 U.S. 88, 98]\n\u00a0\n As we have said, we do not reopen the matters of fact that must be taken to have been found by the two courts. So we assume that there was nothing to hinder Waterman from making this agreement, and that the defendant was organized and acted under it. Whether he had more or less good will to convey perhaps is not very material. We are not prepared to say as matter of law that a man who for years has been trying to do business may not join a partnership for a time long enough to start it with his name and whatever good will he has, and provide that thereafter he will divide territory as above stated, or become a selling agent, at his choico. The obvious motive is met by the protection given in the decree, but does not deprive him of all rights in his name. A sufficient interest is disclosed to sustain the transfer as against the plaintiff, and to free the defendant from a greater liability than would have fallen on A. A. Waterman had he gone on alone.\n Decree affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney:\n In No. 72, the appeal of the Modern Pen Company, I concur in the result.\n In No. 54, the appeal of the L. E. Waterman Company, I dissent from the conclusion reached by the court. It seems to me that the alleged partnership agreement of June 12, 1905, made between Arthur A. Waterman and others, pursuant to which the Modern Pen Company was organized, and under which it claims the right to use the name of 'A. A. Waterman' and 'A. A. Waterman & Co.,' appears upon its face to be a mere sham and a fraudulent device, and is demonstrated to be such by the other evidence. The case presents no question respecting the right of an individual to the bona fide use of his name, but rather the question whether a partnership or a corporation can, \n\n[235 U.S. 88, 99]\n\u00a0\n by purchase or otherwise, obtain the right to use the name of a third party for the very purpose of employing it in unfair competition with the established business of still another party. The case in its circumstances closely resembles International Silver Co. v. William H. Rogers Corp. 67 N. J. Eq. 646, 110 Am. St. Rep. 506, 60 Atl. 187, 3 Ann. Cas. 804, and, for reasons sufficiently indicated by a reference to that case, I think the Modern Pen Company should be unqualifiedly enjoined from using the name 'Waterman.' \n\n\n\n","112":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLANE v.

We see no reason to grant it, but to avoid misunderstanding of the opinion we may add a few words.\n The opinion is explicit as to the main elements of decision. It decides that the title to the lands involved passed to the heirs of Baca by the location of the float and its approval by the officers of the Land Department and order for survey in 1864, in pursuance of the act of 1860 ( 12 Stat. at L. 71, 72, chap. 167). A survey, it was said, was necessary to segregate the land from the public domain, and the condition was satisfied by the Contzen survey. It follows, therefore, that the land was not subject to homestead or other entry under the public land laws, and the asserted jurisdiction of the Land Department over it for that purpose could be restrained.\n It is suggested, however, by appellees that appellants urge that certain claimed Mexican grants conflict with the location, and that the opinion leaves uncertain the effect of this, and that therefore it may encourage or require further litigation. Appellants assert that the effect of the claimed Mexican grants is reserved from decision, and yet the Land Department is enjoined from exercising any jurisdiction over the conflicting areas. \n\n[235 U.S. 17, 21]\n\u00a0\n A few words of explanation will make certain the extent of our decision. In adjustment of the conflict between the Baca grant and the grant to the town of Las Vegas, the act of 1860 was passed. The quantity and the manner of location were defined. The land was to be located in square bodies and be 'vacant land, not mineral, in the territory of New Mexico,' and it was made the duty of the surveyor general of New Mexico to survey and locate the lands when selected by the heirs of Baca. There were no other conditions, and these were fulfilled in 1864\n\n\n But it is said that portions of the tract as located were then embraced in two claimed Mexican grants; to wit, the Tumacacori and Calabazas grant and the San Jos e de Sonoita grant, and that by virtue of  8 of the act of July 22, 1854 (10 Stat. at L. 308, chap. 103), the lands covered by such claims were reserved from other disposal and therefore from location under the Baca float. That section made it the duty of the surveyor general of New Mexico, under such instructions as might be given by the Secretary of the Interior, to ascertain the character and extent of claims to such lands under the laws, usages, and customs of Mexico and Spain, and to make full report on all such claims as originated before the cession of the territory to the United States by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848 [9 Stat. at L. 922], and report the same to Congress for its consideration and action. It was provided that 'until the final action by Congress on such claims, all lands covered thereby shall be reserved from sale or other disposal by the government, and shall not be subject to the donations granted by the previous provisions of this act.'\n Subsequently, by the act of August 4, 1854, the territory acquired under the Gadsden treaty [10 Stat. at L. 1031] was incorporated with the territory of New Mexico and made subject to the laws of that territory (10 Stat. at L. 575, chap. 245). Assuming, not deciding, that this provision made  8 applicable to lands acquired under the Gadsden treaty, the reserva- \n\n[235 U.S. 17, 22]\n\u00a0\n tion was statutory and subject to repeal. Lockhart v. Johnson, \n181 U.S. 516\n, 45 L. ed. 979, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 665. And there are grounds for a contention that the act of 1860, making a grant to the Baca heirs, effected a repeal pro tanto of the reservation of the act of 1854. But there are answers more directly under  8 of that act. The mere fact of a claimed Mexican grant did not reserve the lands covered by it. Ibid. It was only after their presentation to the surveyor general of New Mexico for his report thereon that the lands were reserved 'until the final action of Congress.' There was no reservation except by this statute, and it related only to lands covered by a claim presented to the surveyor general. There is no language in the treaties which implies a reservation. Lockhart v. Johnson, at p. 523.\n The Tumacacori and Calabazas grant was not presented to the surveyor general until June 9, 1864, and his report was not laid before Congress until May 24, 1880. A petition for confirmation of the San Jos e de Sonoita grant was not presented to the surveyor general until December, 1879. It will be seen, therefore, that there was no disclosure of these claims until after the selection of the Baca grant and its location by the Land Department, the consummation of which was accomplished by the approval of the location April 9, 1864. Besides, the Tumacacori and Calabazas claim was held untenable and void by this court (Faxon v. United States, \n171 U.S. 244\n, 43 L. ed. 151, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 849), and the greater part of the San Jos e de Sonoita claim was rejected in Ely v. United States, \n171 U.S. 220\n, 43 L. ed. 142, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 840. And we may say that before the Contzen survey was made  8 of the act of 1854 had been repealed. Lockhart v. Johnson, supra.\n The contention that the lands covered by these claims were reserved by the act of 1854 being untenable, it results that the only conflict with the Baca float as located April 9, 1864, which requires consideration and decision, \n\n[235 U.S. 17, 23]\n\u00a0\n is the one arising from that part of the San Jos e de Sonoita claim which has been confirmed as against the United States. And in any event the lands in that conflict are not public lands or subject to disposal by the Land Department. They belong either to the owners of the Baca float or to the owners of the confirmed portion of the San Jos e de Sonoita grant. But which is the superior claim we cannot now consider or decide because the Sonoita claimants are not parties to this cause, and because the question will more properly arise in the local courts, and not in a proceeding in the District of Columbia against the Secretary of the Interior.\n With this explanation of our former opinion, leave to file the petition for rehearing is denied. \n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLANE v.

The decree further directs the filing of the filed notes and plats of survey of the float for the purpose of defining the outboundaries thereof and segregating the same from the public lands of the United States.\n The origin and history of the Baca grant are set out in Shaw v. Kellogg, \n170 U.S. 312\n, 42 L. ed. 1050, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 632; Maese v. Herman, \n183 U.S. 572\n, 46 L. ed. 335, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 91, and Priest v. Las Vegas, \n232 U.S. 604\n, 58 L. ed.-,34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 449.\n It appears that there was a conflict between this grant and the grant to the town of Las Vegas, which was settled by an act passed on June 21, 1800 (12 Stat. at L. 71, chap. 167), which enabled the heirs of Baca to select 'an equal quantity of vacant land, not mineral, in the territory of New Mexico, to be located by them in square bodies, not ex- \n\n[234 U.S. 525, 527]\n\u00a0\n ceeding five in number.' It was made the duty of the surveyor general of New Mexico 'to make survey and location of the lands so selected by said heirs of Baca when thereunto required by them: Provided, however, that the right hereby granted . . . shall continue in force during three years from the passage of this act, and no longer.'\n The Las Vegas grant was ascertained to contain nearly 500,000 acres ( 496,446 96-100). The Baca heirs were therefore entitled to locate that many acres 'in square bodies, not exceeding five in number.' This controversy concerns the third of the bodies selected. The selection of each tract was to be determined by the same considerations, and those considerations are declared in Shaw v. Kellogg, supra. Each location, it is there said, would necessarily be of considerable size; in fact, each one was nearly 100,000 acres; and each as a whole was to be nonmineral. 'No provision was made for indemnity lands in case mineral should be found in any section or quarter section. So that when the location was perfected the title passed to all the lands or to none.' The limits of location, it was said, was the territory of New Mexico,-limits not so broad as those of the territory ceded by Mexico; within the limits there were large areas of arid lands; 'its surface was broken by a few mountain chains, and crossed by a few rivers.' Lands, it was declared, could not be selected already occupied by others. The lands must be vacant. Nor could lands be selected 'which were then known to contain mineral. Congress did not intend to grant any mines or mineral lands, but, with these exceptions, their right of selection was coextensive with the limits of New Mexico. We say 'lands then known to contain mineral,' for it cannot be that Congress intended that the grant should be rendered nugatory by any future discoveries of mineral. The selection was to be made within three years. The title was then to pass, and \n\n[234 U.S. 525, 528]\n\u00a0\n it would be an insult to the good faith of Congress to suppose that it did not intend that the title, when it passed, should pass absolutely, and not contingently upon subsequent discoveries.' And it was declared that the surveyor general of New Mexico was to determine the character of the lands; he was to make survey and location of the lands selected; upon him 'was cast the specific duty of seeing that the lands selected were such as the Baca heirs were entitled to select.' This is emphasized by saying that 'he was the officer who, by virtue of his duties, was most competent to examine and pass upon the question of the character of the lands sclected.' In the survey and location it was recognized that he was subject to the 'control and direction of the Land Department,' and, while he was not to act in defiance and independently of the Land Department, 'it was for him to say, in the first instance, at least, whether the lands so selected and by him surveyed and located were lands vacated and nonmineral.'\n These are the elements of the decision. How do they apply to the case at bar?\n First, as to the allegations of the bill. There are detailed allegations of the origin of the grant to Baca, its presentation to the surveyor general of New Mexico under the then-existing law and regulations, and his recommendation of its confirmation, also of the confirmation of the grant to the town of Las Vegas, 'leaving,' as he said, 'the respective claimants the right to adjust their conflicting claims in courts.' The other facts which the bill alleges we set out in narrative form as follows:\n Both grants were confirmed and the right given to the heirs of Baca, as we have seen, to select other lands equal in quantity to the lands claimed by Las Vegas.\n On July 26, 1860, about a month after the act was passed, the Commissioner of the General Land Office informed the surveyor general of New Mexico that it was \n\n[234 U.S. 525, 529]\n\u00a0\n the latter's duty to separate from the public lands the pueblos or individual confirmed claims, and in that connection drew his special attention to the act of June 21, 1860, which referred to the 'claim of the Heirs of Luis Maria Baca,' and in order to give the act timely effect the surveyor general was directed to give the claim priority in surveying private land claims. That officer was directed to have the exterior lines of Las Vegas run off, and, this being done, the right would accrue to the Baca claimants to select a quantity equal to the area elsewhere in New Mexico of vacant lands, not mineral, in square bodies, not exceeding five in number. The instructions then proceed as follows:\n'You will furnish them with a certificate, transmitting at the same time a duplicate to this office, of their right and the area they are to select in five square parcels. Should they select in square bodies according to the existing line of the surveys, the matter may be properly disposed of by their application, duly indorsed and signed with your certificate, designating the parts selected by legal divisions or subdivisions, and so selected as to form five separate bodies in square form. Then the certificate thus indorsed is to be noted on the records of the register and receiver of Santa Fe, and sent on here by those officers for approval. Should the Baca claimants select outside of the existing surveys, they must give such distinct descriptions and connection with natural objects in their applications to be filed in your office, as will enable the deputy surveyor, when he may reach the vicinity of such selections in the regular progress of the surveys, to have the selections adjusted as near as may be to the lines of the public surveys, which may hereafter be established in the region of those selections. In either case the final conditions of the certificate to this office must be accompanied by a statement from yourself and register and receiver that the land is vacant and not mineral.' \n\n[234 U.S. 525, 530]\n\u00a0\n The grant to the town of Las Vegas was surveyed and the fact communicated by the surveyor general to the representative of the heirs of Baca, and they were informed that they were entitled to select an equal quantity of land, that he was authorized to survey and locate the same, and that his office was ready to co-operate with their legal representative 'and receive his application for the location of the lands granted by the government.'\n\n Thereupon, on or about June 17, 1863, in pursuance of the notice from the surveyor general and the act of Congress, the following was addressed to the surveyor general:\n I, John S. Watts, the attorney of the heirs of Don Luis Maria Cabeza de Baca, have this day selected as one of the five locations confirmed to said heirs under the 6th section of the act of Congress approved June 21st, 1860, the following tract, to wit: Commencing at a point one mile and a half from the base of the Solero mountain in a direction north 45 degrees east of the highest point of said mountain, running thence from said beginning point west 12 miles, 36 chains, and 44 links, thence south 12 miles, 36 chains, and 44 links, thence east 12 miles, 36 chains, and 44 links, thence north 12 miles, 36 chains, and 44 links, to the place of beginning, the same being situated in that portion of New Mexico now included by act of Congress approved February 24, 1863 [12 Stat. at L. 664, chap. 56], in the territory of Arizona; said tract of land is entirely vacant, unclaimed by anyone, and is not mineral to my knowledge.\n John S. Watts,\n Attorney for the Heirs of Louis Maria Cabeza de Baca.\n On the same day the surveyor general certified to the Commissioner of the General Land Office the fact of the application, repeating it, and concluding as follows: \n\n[234 U.S. 525, 531]\n\u00a0\n And I further certify that the said tract of land being the one- fifth part of the private claim confirmed to the said heirs, contains ninety-nine thousand two hundred and eighty-nine acres and thirty-nine hundredths of an acre, and that this location is the third of the series (application to locate the same, filed in this office October 31, 1862, dated October 30, 1862, having been withdrawn-see letter of commissioner of the General Land Office dated February 5, 1863), and, with the three locations, numbered one, two, and four heretofore made, included four-fifths of the said private claim confirmed to the heirs of Luis Maria Cabeza de Baca, by the act of Congress approved June 21, 1860. Said location is hereby approved.\n In witness whereof I have hereto set my hand this 17th day of June, 1863\n\n\n John A. Clark,\n Surveyor General.\n The communication was mailed the following day, with a letter to the Commissioner as follows:\n Surveyor General's Office,\n Santa Fe, New Mexico, June 18, 1863.\n Honl. J. M. Edmunds, Comm'r of General Land Office,\n Washington City, D. C.\n Sir:--\n I inclose herewith copy of the application and certificate of location No. 3 of the private claim confirmed to the heirs of Luis Maria Cabeza de Baca.\n As this location is far beyond any of the public surveys, I have not deemed it necessary to procure any certificate from the register and receiver of the land office, as, from the nature of the case, they cannot officially know anything concerning it.\n I am respectfully your\n Obt. servt.\n John A. Clark,\n Surveyor General. \n\n[234 U.S. 525, 532]\n\u00a0\n On July 18th the Commissioner acknowledged the receipt of the communication, stating.\n Your approval of the location under consideration is found to have ignored the imperative condition that the lands selected at the base of Solero mountain now included by the act of Congress approved February 24, 1863, in the territory of Arizona, is vacant land and not mineral. Before the application of location No. 3 of the heirs aforesaid can be approved, by this office, it is necessary that our instructions of the 26th of July, 1860, should be complied with by furnishing a statement from yourself and register and receiver that the land thus selected and embracing one fifth of the claim, or 99, 289 39-100 acres, is vacant and not mineral.\n I am very respectfully,\n Your obt. sevt.\n J. M. Edmunds, Commissioner.\n In a letter dated April 2, 1864, the surveyor general, in reply to that of the Commissioner, stated 'that there is no evidence in the office of the surveyor general of New Mexico' that the tract selected 'contains any mineral, or that it is occupied. There have been no public surveys made in the neighborhood of said tract, and there is no record of or concerning the land in question in the surveyor general's office, nor-as I believe-in the office of the register or receiver of the land office of New Mexico. As I am personally unacquainted with that region of country, I cannot certify that the land in question is 'vacant and not mineral' or otherwise. Those facts can only be determined by actual examination and survey.'\n On March 25, 1864, the receiver of the land office in New Mexico made a certificate stating that the lands applied for 'are vacant and not mineral so far as the records of this office show (not having been surveyed).' The register, in his certificate of the same date, stated that \n\n[234 U.S. 525, 533]\n\u00a0\n the lands 'are not surveyed, and, from all information in this office, are vacant and not mineral.'\n On about April 9, 1864, having been required by the Baca heirs to survey the tract located by them, the Commissioner of the General Land Office issued instructions to the surveyor general of Arizona which recited that the location by the Baca heirs had been approved by the surveyor general of New Mexico, in whose jurisdiction, it was said, the application properly came at the date of the approval. The instructions referred to the act of Congress of 1860 and the rights it conferred, and stated that the act of June 2, 1862 [12 Stat. at L. 410, chap. 90], required all grants to be surveyed at the expense of the claimants, and that whenever the Baca claimants should pay or secure to be paid a sum sufficient to liquidate all the expenses a survey was to be directed of the application and transcripts of the field notes and plats to be transmitted to the General Land Office to constitute 'the muniments of title, the law not requiring the issue of patents of these claims.' Directions as to the manner of marking lands were given. Accompanying the instructions was a copy of the certificate of the surveyor general of New Mexico, dated June 17, 1863, and following that the following order:\n General Land Office,\n April 9, 1864.\n Levi Bashford, Esq., Surveyor General, Tucson, Arizona.\n Sir.--\n The foregoing statement and the certificate of Surveyor General Clark having been submitted to this Department, and having undergone a careful examination, the location being approved by him to perfect title under the authority of the act approved June 21, 1860, application for survey having been made. Instructions (copy herewith attached) have been given to Surveyor General Levi Bashford of Arizona, in which territory the lands \n\n[234 U.S. 525, 534]\n\u00a0\n located now are, to run the lines indicated and forward complete survey and plat, to be placed on file for future reference as required by law.\n J. M. Edmunds, Commr.\n In pursuance of this order a survey was undertaken, but the surveyors, while engaged in the work of the survey, were killed by hostile Indians, and no survey was ever returned (alleged on information and belief). Notwithstanding the repeated requests of the heirs of Baca, the Commissioner of the General Land Office failed and refused to continue or have made the survey ordered as above stated, and persisted in such refusal until on or about June 17, 1905, on which date the Commissioner, by an official order, authorized and directed the surveyor general of Arizona to cause a survey to be made, and in pursuance of and under contract No. 136, dated June 17, 1905, one Philip Contzen was authorized and required to run the lines indicated on the application of the Baca heirs (float No. 3) so as to adjust the lines, as near as might be, to the lines of the public surveys.\n The survey was made and duly certified by the surveyor general of Arizona as strictly conformable to the field notes which had been examined, approved, and filed in his office, and that the plat and survey had been examined and found correct by the Commissioner of the General Land Office.\n On or about January 12, 1905, the Commissioner of the General Land Office, disregarding the decision and order of the then Commissioner of the Land Office of April 9, 1864, gave such instructions to the surveyor general of Arizona regarding his duties as to the character of the lands that that officer, in December, 1906, forwarded the plat and survey hereinbefore mentioned to the Commissioner of the General Land Office with a report, accompanied by the alleged information which he had gathered \n\n[234 U.S. 525, 535]\n\u00a0\n and the recommendation that the location of Baca Float No. 3, made, as hereinbefore stated, June 17, 1863, be entirely rejected.\n On or about May 13, 1907, contrary to law, and without jurisdiction so to do, and disregarding the order of his predecessor, the Commissioner rendered a decision ordering a hearing before the surveyor general of Arizona to determine whether said lands were, at the time of said location, vacant and nonmineral. On or about June 2, 1908, the First Assistant Secretary of the Interior, in a decision upon an appeal from said decision of the Commissioner, contrary to law and without jurisdiction, affirmed the decision of the Commissioner in so far as it remanded the case for a hearing before the surveyor general of Arizona.\n A motion to review was subsequently made and denied.\n By the acts done in the selection and location of the lands, including the order of Commissioner Edmunds of April 9, 1864, requiring a survey thereof, the title to the lands vested in fee in the heirs of Baca, and it was not within the power of the Land Department to revoke or annul the prior rulings, or to evade the rights of such heirs or their successors in title, and that (this on information and belief) the Land Department has always treated the lands selected as segregated from the public domain, and they have for many years been so marked upon the maps issued by the Department, as more especially appears from the map of the Territory of Arizona of 1903.\n It is alleged that one Henry Ohm and one Lyman W. Wakefield have filed homestead applications upon land lying within the lands located by the Baca heirs, and instructions have been issued from the officers of the Land Department, permitting proofs to be made thereof. It is alleged that there are many other entries upon the lands, and that they and Ohm's and Wakefield's applications will cast clouds upon the title of the Baca location. \n\n[234 U.S. 525, 536]\n\u00a0\n The value of the lands located is alleged to be over $100,000, and that plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.\n An injunction was prayed restraining defendants from further proceeding in the homestead applications, that they be required to place on file for future reference, as required by law, the Contzen survey and plat dated June 17, 1905; that anything shown thereby or connected therewith, other than that included in the order of the Commissioner of April 9, 1864, and other than the exterior boundaries, accessory lines, crosses and distances, monuments and measurements showing the tract located by the Baca heirs known as location No. 3, together with any topographical features and the references to the lines of the public surveys be canceled and expunged from the said plat of said survey, and particularly the lines, crosses and distances, monuments and measurements purporting to show the segregation from said land of the alleged mineral portion, the Tubac township, and the conflicting portions of the San Jos e, Sonoita, Tumacacori, and Calabasas claims.\n A demurrer was filed to the bill which set out as grounds: (1) The real purpose of the suit is to recover certain real estate situated in the territory of Arizona by trial of the legal title thereto, and that the relief, if any, plaintiffs are entitled to, is at law. (2) If the legal title to the property passed to plaintiffs, as alleged, on April 9, 1864, 'naught else remains for the defendants to do than to perform the ministerial duty of receiving and recording the plat of survey and field notes thereof,' and the remedy is by mandamus. (3) If the legal title to the land has not passed to plaintiffs, as alleged, it is still in the United States, which it is not shown has consented to this suit; and the court in such event is without jurisdiction. (4) On the face of the bill it is impossible to grant the prayers of plaintiffs without deciding whether the title is still in \n\n[234 U.S. 525, 537]\n\u00a0\n the United States. The determination of the suit, therefore, affects the United States, and they are real and indispensable parties in interest, and have not consented to be sued. (5) The acts sought to be enjoined are exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Interior Department and are not subject to judicial control. (6) The parties who have initiated claims are materially interested in the suit and are necessary parties to it. (7) The court is without jurisdiction to expunge the matters and things prayed to be expunged from the plat of the survey of the San Jos e de Sonoita claim for the reason that the claimants are not parties to the suit, and their claim has been confirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States (Ely v. United States, \n171 U.S. 220\n, 43 L. ed. 142, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 840). (8) The citizens of Tubac township are necessary parties. (9) There never has been an adjudication by the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the General Land Office, or either of them, that the lands involved were, on June 17, 1863, nonmineral and vacant or unoccupied lands such as the heirs of Baca were authorized to select under the terms of the 6th section of the act of June 21, 1860 (12 Stat. at L. 71, chap. 167). (10) The plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief prayed for, or to any relief . (1) The bill is in other respects uncertain, informal, and insufficient to entitle plaintiffs to any relief.\n The demurrer was overruled, Mr. Justice Barnard of the supreme court saying that the main question to be decided on the demurrer was as to the effect of the act of Congress, and, considering the act and the proceedings taken under it, recited in the bill, he said he was of opinion that the title to the 'tract vested in the heirs of said Baca when the location was approved and the survey ordered,' and that, therefore, plaintiffs might maintain their bill for some portion, at least, of the substantial relief for which they prayed, and that the demurrer, being to the whole bill, must be overruled. And he said: 'This con- \n\n[234 U.S. 525, 538]\n\u00a0\n clusion as to title, if correct, will enable the suit to be maintained notwithstanding the objection made as to want of other parties defendant. Title being out of the United States, it has no interest and is not a necessary party; and the Land Department cannot rightfully treat the tract as open to public entry, and the officers may therefore be enjoined.'\n The defendants (appellants) then answered.\n The answer admitted what must be regarded as the fundamental elements of the bill. So far as its denials of any of the averments of the bill or its allegations of fact are material, we shall refer to them hereafter. The proofs taken under the bill and answer were not regarded by the supreme court as determining a different decision from that expressed on the demurrer to the bill; that is, the court repeated its view that the title passed on April 9, 1864, to the heirs of Baca, and that the court had authority to enjoin defendants from treating the land as being public land. The injunction prayed for was granted except that the 'Contzen' survey and plat were ordered to be filed unchanged. A decree was entered accordingly. It was affirmed by the court of appeals, as we have said.\n The crux of the case, in the views of the courts below, is the question whether title to the lands passed out of the United States in April, 1864, and the careful and elaborate consideration of it makes the discussion of it mere repetition.\n The contentions of the parties are very accurately opposed. Appellants contend that 'under a proper construction of the act of June 21, 1860, title to the 'float' cannot pass until there has been an official survey and a final determination by the proper officers that the land selected in 1863 was of the character which the statute permitted the heirs to take,-a matter still sub judice in the Department,' except as to certain conflicting grants. The appellees insist, and the courts below, as we have \n\n[234 U.S. 525, 539]\n\u00a0\n seen, decided, that the location of the grant and the approval of it by the surveyor general of New Mexico, and subsequently, in April, 1864, by Commissioner Edmunds of the Land Office, transferred the title to the heirs of Baca.\n There is some controversy upon the fact as to whether the Commissioner had before him the proof he had demanded of the nonmineral character of the land. We think the lower courts rightly deduced from the evidence 'that the Commissioner,' to quote from the opinion of the court of appeals, 'having carefully considered all the facts in the case, concluded to adopt the approval of the surveyor general of New Mexico of this location to perfect title under the authority of said act [act of 1860], and in order completely to segregate this land from the public domain ordered the survey.' [41 App. D. C. 153.] And that this action was within the authority of those officers we may refer to Shaw v. Kellogg, \n170 U.S. 312\n, 42 L. ed. 1050, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 632. In that case, we have seen, the surveyor general of New Mexico was the officer selected and who was most competent to examine and pass upon the question of the character of the lands, and to pass upon them at the time of location,-not upon evidence collected many years after the location, directed to what might have been known many years before. The selection and location was to be made within three years of the passage of the act in a comparative wilderness, and the 'title was then to pass,' and 'pass absolutely, and not contingently upon subsequent discoveries.'\n We recognized in Shaw v. Kellogg that the action of the surveyor general was subject to the supervision of the Land Department, and that condition is satisfied in the case at bar. The Commissioner was put in possession of all of the facts as to the lands, and, exercising his judgment upon them, approved the location.\n The facts in Shaw v. Kellogg give pertinence to its prin- \n\n[234 U.S. 525, 540]\n\u00a0\n ciples, notwithstanding some differences between its facts and those in the case at bar. In that case there was a positive declaration by the surveyor general of the nonmineral character of the lands; in the case at bar it is an inference deduced from the circumstances, it being the 'duty of the officers to decide the question,'-a duty which they 'could not avoid or evade.' In that case the Land Office undertook to reserve from the grant lands which might be subsequently discovered to be mineral. In this case it directed an inquiry of their character long after the location of the grant, and seeks to determine the legality of the location by the information said to be obtained.\n The title having passed by the location of the grant and the approval of it, the title could not be subsequently devested by the officers of the Land Department. Ballinger v. United States, \n216 U.S. 240\n, 54 L. ed. 464, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 338. In other words, and specifically, the action of the Commissioner in approving the location of the grant cannot be revoked by his successor in office, and an attempt to do so can be enjoined. Noble v. Union River Logging R. Co. \n147 U.S. 165\n, 37 L. ed. 123, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 271; Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, \n223 U.S. 605\n, 56 L. ed. 570, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 340. The suit is one to restrain the appellants from an illegal act under color of their office which will cast a cloud upon the title of appellees.\n This disposes of the contentions of appellants that this is a suit against the United States, or one for recovery of land merely, or that there is a defect of parties, or that the suit is an attempted direct appeal from the decision of the Interior Department, or a trial of a title to land not situated within the jurisdiction of the court 'wherein an essential party is not present in the forum and is not even suable,-the United States.'\n We agree with the courts below that a survey was necessary to segregate the lands from the public domain. Stoneroad v. Stoneroad, \n158 U.S. 240\n, 39 L. ed. 966, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 822. This was done by the \n\n[234 U.S. 525, 541]\n\u00a0\n Contzen survey, which, we have seen, was directed to be filed by the lower courts without alteration,-a decision which we approve.\n There are other contentions of appellants which call for no extended comment, as we concur with the courts below in regard to them. For instance, it is contended that the surveyor general of New Mexico had lost authority to approve the location, and that duty had devolved upon the surveyor general of Arizona. To the contention it may be replied, as the court of appeals in effect replied, that the act of 1860 devolved the duty on the surveyor general of New Mexico, and the Land Office, upon whom devolved the ultimate responsibility, approved the location.\n A point is made upon attempts to change the location, of which it is enough to say that they were not accepted by the Land Department, and the claimants were remitted to the location under consideration.\n Another contention is made on the conflict of the grant as located with other grants, to which the court of appeals replied that it was not now concerned with such question, and that if, as suggested, a controversy should arise, it 'will properly be adjudicated in the courts where the lands are located.' In this we concur.\n Whose duty it was to pay the expense of the survey is also in controversy. The appellants assert it to have been the duty of the claimants under the act of June 2, 1862 (12 Stat. at L. 410, chap. 90), and that was the view, we have seen, of the Land Department. The appellees contend that the obligation was upon the government under the granting act. That act provides, as we have seen, that 'it shall be the duty of the surveyor general of New Mexico to make survey and location of the land so selected by the said heirs of Baca when thereunto required by them. . . .' The obligation is explicit, and there was reason for it. To accommodate conflicting claims, and at the instance of \n\n[234 U.S. 525, 542]\n\u00a0\n the government, the Baca claimants gave up their rights to a definite tract of land, and, as appellees say, expressing the equities of the claimants, whatever its character or condition, and the government therefore would naturally make provision for the location of the substituted land as expeditiously as possible, and without expense to the Baca heirs. We therefore think the act of 1860, not that of 1862, applied.\n The contention that appellees have not shown sufficient title is untenable.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Leave granted on June 22, 1914, to present petition for rehearing within thirty days. \n\n\n\n\n","114":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLAPINA v. WILLIAMS(1914)\n\nArgued: Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 78, 79]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William Hawkins for petitioner.\n Assistant Attorney General Denison and Mr. Francis H. McAdoo for respondent\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 78, 82]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n The petitioner, an unmarried woman and a native of Russia, came to the United States in the year 1897 or 1898, at the age of about twelve years, accompanied by \n\n[232 U.S. 78, 83]\n\u00a0\n a man who had promised to marry her, and during the four years immediately following she practised prostitution in the city of New York, and supported her companion with the proceeds of her prostitution; she then left that city, and thereafter continuously practised prostitution in various parts of the United States, including different towns and cities in the states of Washington, Arizona, and Texas. In the month of March, 1908, she returned to Russia for the purpose of visiting her mother, intending at the same time to return to this country; she re-entered the United States at the port of New York in June, 1908, accompanied by her mother, at which time petitioner falsely represented, for the purpose of facilitating her landing, that she was Mrs. Joseph Fiore, and the wife of an American citizen; at the time of this, her second entry, she intended to continue the practice of prostitution in the United States, and almost immediately upon being admitted she engaged in that practice, and was continually engaged in it until September 21, 1909, on which date she was arrested in a house of prostitution in Phoenix, Arizona, upon a warrant of arrest duly issued by the Acting Secretary of Commerce and Labor under the provisions of the immigration act of February 20, 1907 (34 Stat. at L. 898, chap. 1134, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 499). Upon a hearing properly accorded to her, the foregoing facts were established, and an order of deportation was made upon the ground that she was a prostitute, and was such at the time of her entry into the United States; that she entered the United States for the purpose of prostitution; and that she had been found an inmate of a house of prostitution and practising the same within three years after her entry. She obtained a writ of habeas corpus, which, after a hearing, was dismissed by the district court for the southern district of New York. Upon appeal, the circuit court of appeals affirmed the order of dismissal (sub nom. Ex parte Hoffman, 103 C. C. A. 327, 179 Fed. 839). The present writ of cer- \n\n[232 U.S. 78, 84]\n\u00a0\n tiorari was then allowed because of the division of judicial opinion upon the question presented, which is whether the provisions of the immigration act of 1907 respecting admission and deportation apply to an alien such as the petitioner, who, having remained in this country for more than three years (in this instance for more than ten years), after first entry, and having gone abroad for a temporary purpose and with the intention of returning, again seeks and gains admittance into the United States.\n The pertinent provisions of the act of 1907 are set forth in the margin. So far as the present question is concerned, the act is not materially different from-certainly not less stringent than-the act of March 3, 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 1213, chap. 1012). The circuit court of appeals in the present case followed its own decision in Taylor v. United States, 81 C. C. A. 197, 152 Fed. 1, which was based upon the act of\n Sec. 2. That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission into the United States: . . . prostitutes, or women or girls coming into the United States for the purpose of prostitution, or for any other immoral purpose; . . .\n Sec. 3. . . . any alien woman or girl who shall be found an inmate of a house of prostitution or practising prostitution, at any time within three years after she shall have entered the United States, shall be deemed to be unlawfully within the United States, and shall be deported as provided by sections twenty and twenty-one of this act.\n Sec. 20. That any alien who shall enter the United States in violation of law, . . . shall, upon the warrant of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, be taken into custody and deported to the country whence he came at any time within three years after the date of his entry into the United States.\n Sec. 21. That in case the Secretary of Commerce and Labor shall be satisfied that an alien has been found in the United States in violation of this act, or that an alien is subject to deportation under the provisions of this act or of any law of the United States, he shall cause such alien, within the period of three years after landing or entry therein, to be taken into custody and returned to the country whence he came, as provided by section twenty of this act. . . . \n\n[232 U.S. 78, 85]\n\u00a0\n 1903, and in which it was held that while the provisions of the act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 1084, chap. 551, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1294), had been construed as restricted to 'alien immigrants,' the act of 1903 had been so framed as to cover aliens, whether immigrants or not. In behalf of the petitioner it is contended that the court erred in its judgment as to the purpose of Congress in modifying the language of previous acts on adopting the revision of 1903, and that this act and the act of 1907, as well as those that preceded them, when properly construed, refer to 'alien immigrants' exclusively.\n The Acts of 1903 and 1907 being revisions or compilations (with some modifications) of previous acts pertaining to the same general subject- matter, a reference list, in chronological order, is for convenience set forth in the margin. \n Immigration Acts.

Supp. 1911, p. 501). \n\n[232 U.S. 78, 86]\n\u00a0\n In a number of cases in the Federal district and circuit cours, it was held that the provisions of the act of March 3, 1891, and the acts that preceded it, relating to the exclusion and deportation of persons arriving in the United States from foreign countries, were confined in their operation to 'alien immigrants;' and that this term did not include aliens previously resident in this country, who had temporarily departed with the intention of returning.

The same view was expressed by the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit in Moffit v. United States (1904) 63 C. C. A. 117, 128 Fed. 375.\n Upon the reasoning and authority of these cases, a similar construction was given to the act of 1903 in United States v. Aultman Co. ( 1906) 143 Fed. 922 (affirmed by the circuit court of appeals, 79 C. C. A. 457, 148 Fed. 1022), the attention of the court apparently not having been directed to the question whether any significant change had been made in the law by the revision of 1903\n\n\n But in Taylor v. United States (1907) 81 C. C. A. 197, 152 Fed. 1, which was a review by the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit of a judgment of conviction upon an indictment for a misdemeanor for permitting an alien sailor to land in New York, contrary to  18 of the act of \n\n[232 U.S. 78, 87]\n\u00a0\n 1903, which made it the duty of the owners, officers, and agents of any vessel bringing an alien to the United States to adopt due precautions to prevent the landing of any such alien, etc., the court reviewed the changes made by Congress in the revision of 1903, 'following decisions of the courts which tended to relax the provisions of earlier acts,' and, finding that  18 of the act of 1903 substantially re-enacted a part of  8 of the act of 1891, employing the term 'alien' in the place of the term 'alien immigrant,' and that similar changes were made in other parts of the act, came to the conclusion that the change evinced an intent of Congress to use the word 'alien' in its ordinary and unqualified meaning. This decision was reviewed in this court, and the judgment was reversed, but upon the ground (\n207 \nU.S. 120, 124\n, 52 S. L. ed. 130, 132, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 53) that  18 did not apply to the ordinary case of a sailor deserting while on shore leave.\n Shortly after the decision of the circuit court of appeals in the Taylor Case, the circuit court of appeals for the third circuit, in Rodgers v. United States (1907) 81 C. C. A. 454, 152 Fed. 346 held that the provision of  2 of the act of 1903, enumerating the classes of aliens to be excluded from admission into the United States, and amongst them 'persons afflicted with a loathsome or with a dangerous contagious disease,' and the provision of  19, for the deportation of 'aliens brought into this country in violation of law,' could not be construed so as to extend to aliens domiciled in this country; affirming Re Buchsbaum, 141 Fed. 221. In United States v. Nakashima (1908) 87 C. C. A. 646, 160 Fed. 842, the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit adopted the same view of the act of 1903 expressed in the Aultman and Rodgers Cases, rejecting that adopted by the court of appeals in Taylor v. United States.\n On the other hand, the latter decision has been followed in a number of cases arising under the act of 1907, which in this respect does not materially differ from the act of \n\n[232 U.S. 78, 88]\n\u00a0\n 1903.

L. ed. 1082, 1085, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 967.\n The question, therefore, is not the power of Congress, but its intent and purpose as expressed in legislation. The cases that have held the immigration acts not to apply to domiciled aliens returning after a temporary absence have been rested in part upon the use of the term 'immigration' in the titles of the respective acts, and in part upon the employment of that or similar terms in the enacting clauses.\n As authority for a liberal interpretation of the acts, two decisions of this court have at times been referred to, which have, however, little, if any, present pertinency. Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, \n143 U.S. 457\n, 36 L. ed. 226, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 511, held that the contract- labor law of February 26, 1885 (23 Stat. at L. 332, chap; 164, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1290), did not forbid a contract for employing a clergyman. The act was construed according to its spirit rather than its letter, and, in view of its title, the evil intended to be remedied, the circumstances surround- \n\n[232 U.S. 78, 89]\n\u00a0\n ing the appeal to Congress for legislation, and the reports of committees in each House, it was held to be the legislative purpose simply to stay the influx of cheap unskilled labor. Since this decision, an express exception has been made of 'ministers of any religious denomination.' In Lau Ow Bew v. United States, \n144 U.S. 47\n, 36 L. ed. 340, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 517, this court held that the provision of the Chinese restriction act of May 6, 1882 (22 Stat. at L. 58, chap. 126,  6), as amended by act of July 5, 1884 (23 Stat. at L. 115, chap. 220, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1305), requiring every Chinese merchant coming into this country to procure and produce a certificate from the Chinese government, did not apply to Chinese merchants already domiciled in the United States, who, having left this country for some temporary purpose, sought to re-enter it upon their return to their homes here. But this decision was based in part upon the language of the particular statute, and in part upon the fact that our treaty with China gave to Chinese merchants domiciled in the United States the right of egress and ingress, and the other rights, privileges, and immunities enjoyed in this country by the citizens or subjects of the most favored nation.\n The legislative history of the act of 1903 demonstrates that the elimination of the word 'immigrant' and other equivalent qualifying phrases was done deliberately. The bill originated in the House of Representative, where the committee report declared that its general purpose was 'to bring together in one act scattered legislation heretofore enacted in regard to the immigration of aliens into the United States ; . . . to amend such portions thereof as have been found, either as the result of experience in administering the law or of judicial decision, to be inadequate to accomplish the purpose plainly intended thereby; and to add thereto such further provisions as seemed to be demanded by the consensus of enlightened public opinion.' H. Rept. 982, 57th Cong. 1st Sess. The report of the Senate Committee likewise explained \n\n[232 U.S. 78, 90]\n\u00a0\n the bill as being in the main a re-enactment of existing laws on the subject of immigration, stating: 'The necessity for such re-enactment is due in part to the fact that, as a result of judicial decisions, as well as of administrative experience, the efficiency of such laws to accomplish the evident purpose of their enactment has been shown to be materially less than appeared to be at the case at the time of such enactment, and therefore a new expression of the legislative will upon the subject of immigration has become desirable.' The Senate inserted the word 'immigrant' in one place, but it was eliminated in conference. S. Rept. 2119, 57th Cong. 1st Sess.; S. Doc. 62, 57th Cong. 2d Sess. Cong. Record, vol. 36, p. 2949, 57th Cong. 2d Sess.\n Counsel for petitioner cites the debates in Congress as indicating that the act was not understood to refer to any others than immigrants. But the unreliability of such debates as a source from which to discover the meaning of the language employed in an act of Congress has been frequently pointed out (United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Asso. \n166 \nU.S. 290, 318\n, 41 S. L. ed. 1007, 1019, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 540, and cases cited), and we are not disposed to go beyond the reports of the committees . (Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 457, 463\n, 36 S. L. ed. 226, 229, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 511; Binns v. United States, \n194 \nU.S. 486, 495\n, 48 S. L. ed. 1087, 1090, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 816; Johnson v. Southern P. Co. \n196 \nU.S. 1, 19\n, 49 S. L. ed. 363, 370, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 158, 17 Am. Neg. Rep. 412).\n It is earnestly insisted that the omission of the word 'immigrant' is of little consequence, because it does not apply at all to the excluding section. It is said that the words 'alien immigrant' did not occur in the Acts of 1875, 1882, 1885, or 1887, and did not occur in the excluding section of the act of 1891, but only in its 8th section,-that which related to manifesting. But in the act of 1893, 'To Facilitate the Enforcement,' etc., each section was made to apply to 'alien immigrants.' The force of the argument pretty well disappears when we recall that it was in spite of the absence of the word 'immigrant' in the \n\n[232 U.S. 78, 91]\n\u00a0\n excluding clause that courts had held that because the word occurred in the title and in other provisions of the pertinent acts, the excluding clauses likewise were confined to immigrants, in the sense of aliens who had no domicil in this country. Of course, there were other considerations,- the extreme hardship in individual cases where the aliens had long been resident in this country, and the practically uncontrolled authority of the executive officers of the government, being among them. But, whatever considerations may have combined to bring about the judicial interpretation of the acts that preceded the revision of 1903, the committee reports already cited sufficiently show that the language of the new act was chosen not for the purpose of adopting, but in order to avoid, that interpretation.\n Upon a review of the whole matter, we are satisfied that Congress, in the act of 1903, sufficiently expressed, and in the act of 1907 reiterated, the purpose of applying its prohibition against the admission of aliens, and its mandate for their deportation, to all aliens whose history, condition, or characteristics brought them within the descriptive clauses, irrespective of any qualification arising out of a previous residence or domicil in this country.\n The excluding section as found in the act of 1907 contains in its own language the clearest answer to the entire argument for the petitioner. It reads as follows (34 Stat. at L. 898, chap. 1134, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 500): 'That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission into the United States: All idiots, imbeciles, feeble- minded persons, epileptics, insane persons, and persons who have been insane within five years previous; persons who have had two or more attacks of insanity at any time previously; paupers; persons likely to become a public charge; professional beggars; persons afflicted with tuberculosis or with a loathsome or dangerous contagious disease; persons not comprehended within any of the foregoing excluded classes, who are found to be \n\n[232 U.S. 78, 92]\n\u00a0\n and are certified by the examining surgeon as being mentally or physically defective, such mental or physical defect being of a nature which may affect the ability of sucy alien to earn a living; persons who have been convicted of or admit having committed a felony or other crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; polygamists, or persons who admit their belief in the practice of polygamy; anarchists, or persons who believe in or advocate the overthrow by force or violence of the government of the United States, or of all government, or of all forms of law, or the assassination of public officials; prostitutes, or women or girls coming into the United States for the purpose of prostitution, or for any other immoral purpose; persons who procure or attempt to bring in prostitutes, or women or girls for the purpose of prostitution, or for any other immoral purpose; persons hereinafter called contract laborers, who have been induced or solicited to migrate to this country by offers or promises of employment, or in consequence of agreements, oral, written, or printed, express or implied, to perform labor in this country of any kind, skilled or unskilled;' etc., etc. None of these excluded classes (with the possible exception of contract laborers, whose exclusion depends upon somewhat different considerations) would be any less undesirable if previously domiciled in the United States. And besides, the section contains its own specific provisos and limitations, and these, on familiar principles, strongly tend to negative any other and implied exception.\n There remains, therefore, only the use of the word 'immigration' in the title of the act to furnish support for petitioner's contention. But it is only in a doubtful case that the title of an act can control the meaning of the enacting clauses, and there is no such doubt here. United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch, 358, 386, 2 L. ed. 304, 314; Church of The Holy Trinity v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 457, 462\n, 36 S. L. ed. 226, 229, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 511; Coosaw Min. Co. v.

Rep. 53, to intimate an opinion with respect to the construction of  18 of the act of 1903 that is inconsistent with the result now reached. There the circuit court of appeals (one judge dissenting) had construed that section as excluding even the ordinary sailor, if an alien; basing this construction upon the changes wrought by Congress in the revision of 1903. This court, speaking by Mr. Justice Holmes, said: 'A reason for the construction adopted below was found in the omission of the word 'immigrant' which had followed 'alien' in the earlier acts. No doubt that may have been intended to widen the reach of the statute, but we see no reason to suppose that the omission meant to do more than to avoid the suggestion that no one was within the act who did not come here with intent to remain. It is not necessary to regard the change as a mere abbreviation, although the title of the statute is 'An Act to Regulate the Immigration of Aliens into the United States.\" Of course, this language was employed with reference to the facts of that case, and was not intended to negative a purpose on the part of Congress to bring within the reach of the statute aliens who had previously resided in this country. In that case there was no element of previous residence.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","115":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLAZARUS, MICHEL & LAZARUS v. PRENTICE(1914)\nNo. 1012\nArgued: Decided: June 8, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 263, 264]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry L. Lazarus, David Sessler, Girault Farrar, Herman Michel, and Eldon S. Lazarus for appellants.\n Messrs. H. Generes Dufour and Edwin T. Rice for appellees.\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 263, 265]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a motion to dismiss the appeal of Lazarus, Michel, & Lazarus, interveners in a certain bankruptcy proceeding in the district court of the United States for the eastern district of Louisiana, where the intervening petition was dismissed (205 Fed. 413), which order was affirmed on appeal to the circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit ( 211 Fed. 326). The interveners now attempt to bring the case to this court by appeal on the ground that the judgment of the circuit court of appeals was not final in the proceeding.\n The facts are not materially in dispute, and, as found by both the district court and the circuit court of appeals, appear to be: Antonio Musica and Philip Musica were partners in trade under the firm name of A. Musica & Son, importers of hair in the city of New York. They had become largely indebted, and on the 19th of March, 1913, a petition in involuntary bankruptcy was filed in the district court of the United States for the southern district of New York against the firm and the individual members thereof, and a receiver was appointed of the bankrupt estate, the partnership and its members being subsequently adjudicated bankrupts. On the same day the petition was filed the bankrupts and Arthur Musica were arrested as fugitives from justice in the city of New Orleans, and Lucy Grace Musica was held as a material witness. Upon search there was found upon their persons, variously distributed among them and concealed in divers ways, about $75,000 in money, and notes, mortgages, and insurance policies amounting in value to some $50,000 more. Without going into detail, upon the admissions of the parties it became perfectly apparent that the property in question belonged to the bankrupt estate. The district for the eastern district of Louisiana, upon petition, confirmed the receiver \n\n[234 U.S. 263, 266]\n\u00a0\n as temporary receiver of that court, and directed that all the property be turned over to him, to be transmitted to the trustee or trustees in bankruptcy of A. Musica & Son, elected and qualified in the district court for the southern district of New York, to be disposed of under and subject to the orders of that court.\n While the Musicas took the case to the Circuit court of appeals, no appeal has been sued out by them to this court, and the only questions here concern the intervention of Lazarus, Michel, & Lazarus, who, on April 28, 1913, filed an intervening petition in the district court for the eastern district of Louisiana, claiming $15,000 as attorney fees for services rendered the Musicas in the proceedings against them in the courts of Louisiana to protect their property rights and possession, and for services to be rendered in representing them in proceedings in New York, if their services were there required. The decree of the district court, which was affirmed in the circuit court of appeals, dismissed the petition in intervention of Lazarus, Michel, & Mlazarus, reserving their right to assert whatever claim they may have in the bankruptcy & Lazarus, reserving their right to assert\n The filing of the petition and adjudication in the bankruptcy court in New York brought the property of the bankrupts, wherever situated, into custodia legis, and it was thus held from the date of the filing of the petition, so that subsequent liens could not be given or obtained thereon, nor proceedings had in other courts to reach the property, the court of original jurisdiction having acquired the full right to administer the estate under the bankruptcy law.

Under clause 3 of  2 of the bankruptcy act of 1898 (30 Stat. at L. 544, chap. 541, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3418) the receiver in the original case would have had the right, acting under authority of the court to take possession in a summary \n\n[234 U.S. 263, 267]\n\u00a0\n proceeding of the bankrupts' property, found as was this, in possession of those admittedly holding it for the bankrupts, and to hold the property until the qualification of the trustee, or until the bankruptcy petition should be dismissed, if that should happen. Bryan v. Bernheimer, \n181 U.S. 188\n, 45 L. ed. 814, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 557; Mueller v. Nugent, supra. Prior to the amendment of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. at L. 838, chap. 412 U. S. Comp Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1493), this court had held that in cases where the bankruptcy court of original jurisdiction could itself make a summary order for the delivery of property to the trustee or receiver, the court of ancillary jurisdiction could do so (Babbitt v. Dutcher, \n216 U.S. 102\n, 54 L. ed. 402, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 372, 17 Ann. Cas. 969), and by clause 20, added to  2 by the amendment of June 25, 1910, the bankruptcy courts were specifically given ancillary jurisdiction over persons or property within their respective territorial limits in aid of a trustee or receiver appointed in any court of bankruptcy. Under this amendment there can be no question that the district court in Louisiana had authority to appoint a receiver, and to take summary proceedings for the restoration of the bankrupts' estate, which was in the custody of people having no right to it, in order that the same might be turned over to the bankruptcy court having jurisdiction for administration. Under the circumstances here shown, there can be no question that this authority was properly exercised in this case.\n The property, when seized, was, by virtue of the terms of the bankruptcy act, held for and to be turned over to the court of original jurisdiction, and no right could be acquired in it by assignment subsequent to the filing of the petition which would defeat this purpose. Such assignment was a mere nullity, properly disregarded by the bankruptcy court, and notwithstanding which it could direct the delivery of the bankrupts' property to the receiver by summary order. Babbitt v. Dutcher, supra. There is no contention that Lazarus, Michel, & Lazarus had any lien upon this property at the time of the appre- \n\n[234 U.S. 263, 268]\n\u00a0\n hension of the parties and the seizure of the property. Whatever rights they had are asserted to arise by virtue of the assignments made April 1, 1913, and after the filing of the original petition in bankruptcy.\n For an attorney fee for services to be rendered in contemplation of bankruptcy the act makes specific provision in subdivision d of  60, and the amount thus attempted to be used in contemplation of bankruptcy proceedings is subject to revision in the court of original jurisdiction, and not elsewhere. See Re Wood & Henderson, \n210 U.S. 246\n, 52 L. ed. 1046, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 621.\n The contention of the appellants, and the proposition upon which they rely to sustain jurisdiction in this court, is that, by their intervention in the proceeding in the United States district court in Louisiana, they initiated a controversy in the bankruptcy proceeding which is appealable to this court from the circuit court of appeals, as are ordinary cases in equity where original jurisdiction does not rest on diverse citizenship entirely (Judicial Code,  128 [36 Stat. at L. 1133, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 193]). To maintain that proposition Hewit v. Berlin Mach. Works, \n194 U.S. 296\n, 48 L. ed. 986, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 690; Coder v. Arts, \n213 U.S. 223\n, 53 L. ed. 772, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 436, 16 Ann. Cas. 1008; Knapp v. Milwaukee Truse Co. \n216 U.S. 545\n, 54 L. ed. 610, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 412; Houghton v. Burden, \n228 U.S. 161\n, 57 L. ed. 780, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 491, and cases of that character, are cited. In those cases it was held that controversies arising in bankruptcy, in the nature of plenary suits, concerning property claimed by others than the bankrupt, do not come under the special provisions of the bankruptcy act governing petitions for review and appeals, but take the course of ordinary cases in equity, and are not final in the circuit court of appeals where other cases of a similar character would not be.\n The bankruptcy act provides for review under  24b of administrative orders and decrees in the course of bankruptcy proceedings which are not made specially appealable under  25a. And controversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings, of the character of which we \n\n[234 U.S. 263, 269]\n\u00a0\n have spoken, under  24a, are appealable like other equity cases. See Re Loving, \n224 U.S. 183\n, 56 L. ed. 725, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 446. In this case the merely ancillary jurisdiction invoked in the seizure of this property in the hands of those holding it for the bankrupts was in a mere summary proceeding in bankruptcy, and its character could not be changed or its jurisdiction enlarged, by the attempted intervention of Lazarus, Michel, & Lazarus under alleged assignments of the property, made after the filing of the petition in bankruptcy proceedings in the original case. We think the district court was right in holding, and the circuit court of appeals right in affirming its decision, that whatever claim Lazarus, Michel, & Lazarus had under the circumstances here shown must be asserted in the court of original jurisdiction. The attempted intervention in the ancillary proceeding did not give jurisdiction over a controversy in bankruptcy appealable under the Judicial Code to the court of appeals, and thence to this court. This conclusion must result in the dismissal of the attempted appeal here.\n It is contended, however, that this motion is premature, because the record in this case has not been printed. It is true that ordinarily such motions, made before the record is printed, must be accompanied by a statement of facts upon which they rest, or by printed copies of so much of the records as will enable the court to understand the case. Under the present practice it is permisible to file the record printed in the court below, and we have a printed transcript of the proceedings in the district court. In this printed record matters which the briefs do not dispute are shown, and we think we are sufficiently advised as to the situation of the case to dispose of it now without doing injustice the the parties. St. Louis Nat. Bank v. United States Ins. Co. \n100 U.S. 43\n, 25 L. ed. 547.\n We reach the conclusion that this appeal must be dismissed. \n\n\n\n","116":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEROY FIBRE CO. v. CHICAGO, M. & ST. P. R. CO.(1914)\nNo. 175\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1914\n\n\n\n The following questions are certified:\n'1. In an action at law by the owner of a natural product of the soil, such as flax straw, which he lawfully stored on his own premises, and which was destroyed by fire caused by the negligent operation of a locomotive engine, to recover the value thereof from the railroad company operating the engine, is it a question for the jury whether the owner was also negligent, without other evidence than \n\n[232 U.S. 340, 341]\n\u00a0\n that the railroad company preceded the owner in the establishment of its business, that the property was inflammable in character, and that it was stored near the railroad right of way and track?\n\n'2. Is it a question for the jury whether an owner who lawfully stores his property on his own premises adjacent to a railroad right of way and track is held to the exercise of reasonable care to protect it from fire set by the negligence of the railroad company, and not resulting from unavoidable accident or the reasonably careful conduct of its business?\n\n'3. As respects liability for the destruction by fire of property lawfully held on private premises adjacent to a railroad right of way and track, does the owner discharge his full legal duty for its protection if he exercises that care which a reasonably prudent man would exercise under like circumstances to protect it from the dangers incident to the operation of the railroad, conducted with reasonable care?'\n\n The LeRoy Fibre Company, plaintiff in error (we will refer to it as plaintiff), brought an action against defendant in error (referred to herein as defendant) in a state court of Minnesota to recover the value of certain flax straw alleged to have been negligently burned and destroyed by defendant. The cause was removed to the circuit court for the district of Minnesota, where it was tried. One of the grounds of negligence set forth was that a locomotive engine of defendant, while passing the premises of plaintiff, was so negligently managed and operated by defendant's employees that it emitted and threw sparks and coals of unusual size upon the stacks of flax straw, and thereby set fire to and destroyed them.\n The evidence at the trial showed the following without dispute:\n'Some years after defendant had constructed and commenced operating its line of railroad through Grand Meadow, Minnesota, the plaintiff established at \n\n[232 U.S. 340, 342]\n\u00a0\n that village a factory for the manufacture of tow from flax straw. The plaintiff had adjacent to its factory premises, a tract of ground abutting upon the railroad right of way and approximately 250 by 400 feet in dimension, upon which it stored flax straw it purchased for use in its manufacturing business. There were about 230 stacks, arranged in two rows, parallel with the right of way. Each stack contained from 3 to 3 1\/2 tons of straw. The distance from the center of the railroad track to the fence along the line of the right of way was 50 feet, from the fence to the nearest row of stacks, 20 or 25 feet, and from the fence to the second row of stacks, about 35 feet. A wagon road ran between the fence and the first row. On April 2, 1907, during a high wind, a fire started upon one of the stacks in the second row, and as a result all were consumed. The fire did not reach the stack through the intervening growth or refuse, but first appeared on the side of the stack above the ground. The flax straw was inflammable in character. It was easily ignited and easily burned.\n\n'There was substantial evidence at the trial tending to show that the fire was started by a locomotive engine of defendant which had just passed, and that through the negligent operation of defendant's employees in charge, it emitted large quantities of sparks and live cinders, which were carried to the straw stack by a high wind then prevailing. It was contended at the trial by defendant, that plaintiff itself was negligent, and that its negligence contributed to the destruction of its property. There was no evidence that plaintiff was negligent save that it had placed its property of an inflammable character upon its own premises so near the railroad tracks, that is to say, the first row of stacks, 70 or 75 feet, and the second row, in which the fire started, about 85 feet from the center of the railroad track. In other words, the character of the property and its proximity \n\n[232 U.S. 340, 343]\n\u00a0\n to an operated railroad, for which plaintiff was responsible, was the sole evidence of plaintiff's contributory negligence.\n\n'The trial court charged the jury that though the destruction of the straw was caused by defendant's negligence, yet if the plaintiff, in placing and maintaining two rows of stacks of flax straw within a hundred feet of the certer line of the railroad, failed to exercise that ordinary care to avoid danger of firing its straw from sparks from engines passing on the railroad that a person of ordinary prudence would have exercised, under like circumstances, and that the failure contributed to cause the accident, the plaintiff could not recover. The trial court also submitted two questions to the jury, as follows:\n\n'1. Did the Fibre Company, in placing and keeping two rows of flax straw within 100 feet of the center line of the railroad, fail to use the care to avoid danger to its straw from sparks of fire from engines operating on that railroad, that a person of ordinary prudence would have used under like circumstances? 2. Did the engineer McDonald fail to use that degree of care to prevent sparks from his engine from firing the stacks as he passed them, on April 2, 1907, that a person of ordinary prudence would have used under like circumstances?\n\n'The jury answered both questions in the affirmative and found a general verdict for the defendant. Judgment was accordingly entered for defendant. The plaintiff duly saved esceptions to the charge of the court regarding its contributory negligence and to the submission of the first question to the jury, and has assigned the action of the court as error.'\n\n Messrs. John F. Fitzpatrick, Edward P. Sanborn, and F. M. Catlin for the Le Roy Fibre Company.\n\n\n[232 U.S. 340, 346]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. H. Field and M. B. Webber for the Chicago, Milwaukee, & St. Paul Railway Company.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice McKenna:\n\n\n[232 U.S. 340, 348]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The questions certified present two facts-(1) The negligence of the railroad was the immediate cause of the destruction of the property. (2) The property was placed \n\n[232 U.S. 340, 349]\n\u00a0\n by its owner near the right of way of the railroad, but on the owner's own land.\n The query is made in the first two questions whether the latter fact constituted evidence of negligence of the owner, to be submitted to the jury. It will be observed, the use of the land was of itself a proper use,- it did not interfere with nor embarrass the rightful operation of the railroad. It is manifest, therefore, the questions certified, including the thire question, are but phases of the broader one, whether one is limited in the use of one's property by its proximity to a railroad; or, to limit the proposition to the case under review, whether one is subject in its use to the careless as well as to the careful operation of the road. We might not doubt that an immediate answer in the negative should be given if it were not for the hesitation of the circuit court of appeals, evinced by its questions, and the decisions of some courts in the affirmative. That one's uses of his property may be subject to the servitude of the wrongful use by another of his property seems an anomaly. It upsets the presumptions of law, and takes from him the assumption, and the freedom which comes from the assumption, that the other will obey the law, not violate it. It casts upon him the duty of not only using his own property so as not to injure another, but so to use his own property that it may not be injured by the wrongs of another. How far can this subjection be carried? Or, confining the question to railroads, what limits shall be put upon their immunity from the result of their wrongful operation? In the case at bar, the property destroyed is described as inflammable, but there are degrees of that quality; and how wrongful must be the operation? In this case, large quantities of sparks and 'live cinders' were emitted from the passing engine. Houses may be said to be inflammable, and may be, as they have been, set on fire by sparks and cinders from defective or carelessly handled locomotives. Are they to be subject as well as \n\n[232 U.S. 340, 350]\n\u00a0\n stacks of flax straw, to such lawless operation? And is the use of farms also, the cultivation of which the building of the railroad has preceded? Or is that a use which the railroad must have anticipated, and to which it hence owes a duty, which it does not owe to other uses? And why? The question is especially pertinent and immediately shows that the rights of one man in the use of his property cannot be limited by the wrongs of another. The doctrine of contributory negligence is entirely out of place. Depart from the simple requirement of the law, that everyone must use his property so as not to injure others, and you pass to refinements and confusing considerations. There is no embarrassment in the principle even to the operation of a railroad. Such operation is a legitimate use of property; other property in its vicinity may suffer inconveniences and be subject to risks by it, but a risk from wrongful operation is not one of them.\n The legal conception of property is of rights. When you attempt to limit them by wrongs, you venture a solecism. If you declare a right is subject to a wrong, you confound the meaning of both. It is difficult to deal with the opposing contention. There are some principles that have axiomatic character. The tangibility of property is in its uses, and that the uses by one owner of his property may be limited by the wrongful use of another owner of his is a contradiction. But let us pass from principle to authority.\n Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Richardson, \n91 U.S. 454\n, 23 L. ed. 356, was an action for damages for the destruction of a sawmill, lumber shed, and other buildings and manufactured lumber, by fire communicated by a locomotive engine of a railroad. Some of the buildings were erected in part on the company's land near its track, and the railroad company requested the court to charge the jury that the erection of the buildings or the storing of lumber so near the company's track, as the evidence showed, was an \n\n[232 U.S. 340, 351]\n\u00a0\n improvident or careless act, and that if such location contributed in any degree to the loss which ensued, then the plaintiffs could not recover, even though the fire was communicated by the railroad company's locomotive. The court refused the request and its action was sustained. Mr. Justice Strong, speaking for the court, said: 'Such a location, if there was a license [for it, it not then being a trespass], was a lawful use of its property by the plaintiffs; and they did not lose their right to compensation for its loss occasioned by the negligence of the defendant. Cook v. Champlain Transp. Co. 1 Denio, 91; Fero v. Buffalo & State Line R. Co. 22 N. Y. 215, 78 Am. Dec. 178.'\n In Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. v. South Fork Coal Co. 1 L.R.A.(N. S.) 533, 71 C. C. A. 316, 139 Fed. 530, there was the destruction of lumber placed on the railroad's right of way by permission of the railroad. It was destroyed by fire occurring through the negligent operation of the railroad's trains. Contributory negligence was urged against the right of recovery. The court (circuit court of appeals for the Sixth circuit), commenting on the cases cited by the railroad, said: 'But in so far as the opinions go upon the theory that a plaintiff must lose his right of compensation for the negligent destruction of his own property, situated upon his own premises, because he had exposed it to dangers which could come to it only through the negligence of the railroad company, they do not meet our approval.'\n After citing cases, the court continued: 'The rights of persons to the use and enjoyment of their own property are held upon no such tenure as this. The principle would forbid the use of property for many purposes if in such proximity to a railroad track as to expose it to dangers attributable to the negligent management of its business.' Other cases might be adduced. They are cited in Thompson on Negligence,  2314, and Shearman and Redfield on Negligence,  680, for the principle that an owner of property is not limited in the uses of his property by its \n\n[232 U.S. 340, 352]\n\u00a0\n proximity to a railroad, or subject to other risks than those which come from the careful operation of the road or unavoidable accident.\n The first and second questions we answer in the negative, and the third question in the affirmative.\n So ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes, partially concurring:\n The first two questions concern a standard of conduct, and therefore that which, in its nature and in theory, is a question of law. In this, I gather, we all agree, although the proposition often is forgotten or denied. But while the standard is external to the judgment of the party concerned, and must be known and conformed to by him at his peril (The Germanic [Oceanic Steam Nav. Co. v. Aitken] \n196 \nU.S. 589, 596\n, 49 S. L. ed. 610, 613, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 317), courts, by a practice that seems at first sight an abdication of their function where it is most needed, but that I dare say is justified by good sense, in nice cases leave the standard to the jury as well as the facts. In the questions before us, however, the elements supposed are few and frequently recurring, so that but for what I have to say I should be very content to find that we were able to lay down the proper rule without a jury's aid. Furthermore, with regard to what that rule should be, I agree, for the purposes of argument, that as a general proposition people are entitled to assume that their neighbors will conform to the law; that a negligent tort is unlawful in as full a sense as a malicious one, and therefore that they are entitled to assume that their neighbors will not be negligent.\n Nevertheless, I am not prepared to answer the first question, No, if it is to be answered at all. We are bound to consider that at a trial the case would be presented with more facts,-that this case was presented with at least one more fact bearing upon the right to recover,-I mean the distance. If a man stacked his flax so near to a railroad \n\n[232 U.S. 340, 353]\n\u00a0\n that it obviously was likely to be set fire to by a well-managed train, I should say that he could not throw the loss upon the railroad by the oscillating result of an inquiry by the jury whether the road had used due care. I should say that, although of course he had a right to put his flax where he liked upon his own land, the liability of the railroad for a fire was absolutely conditioned upon the stacks being at a reasonably safe distance from the train. I take it that probably many, certainly some, rules of law based on less than universal considerations are made absolute and universal in order to limit those over-refined speculations that we all deprecate, especially where such rules are based upon or affect the continuous physical relations of material things. The right that is given to inflict various inconveniences upon neighboring lands by building or digging is given, I presume, because of the public interest in making improvement free, yet it generally is made absolute by the common law. It is not thought worth while to let the right to build or maintain a barn depend upon the speculations of a jury as to motives. A defect in the highway, declared a defect in the interest of the least competent travelers that can travel unattended without taking legal risks, or in the interest of the average man, I suppose to be a defect as to all. And as in this case the distinction between the inevitable and the negligent escape of sparks is one of the most refined in the world, I think that I must be right so far, as to the law in the case supposed.\n If I am right so far, a very important element in determining the right to recover is whether the plaintiff's flax was so near to the track as to be in danger from even a prudently managed engine. Here certainly, except in a clear case, we should call in the jury. I do not suppose that anyone would call it prudent to stack flax within 5 feet of the engines, or imprudent to do it at a distance of half a mile, and it would not be absurd if the law ulti- \n\n[232 U.S. 340, 354]\n\u00a0\n mately should formulate an exact measure, as it has tended to in other instances (Martin v. District of Columbia, \n205 \nU.S. 135, 139\n, 51 S. L. ed. 743, 744, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 440); but at present I take it that if the question I suggest be material, we should let the jury decide whether 70 feet was too near by the criterion that I have proposed. Therefore, while the majority answer the first question, No, on the ground that the railroad is liable upon the facts stated as matter of law, I should answer it Yes, with the proviso that it was to be answered No, in case the jury found that the flax, although near, was not near enough to the trains to endanger it if the engines were prudently managed, or else I should decline to answer the question because it fails to state the distance of the stacks.\n I do not think we need trouble ourselves with the thought that my view depends upon differences of degree. The whole law does so as soon as it is civilized. See Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 376\n, 377 S., 57 L. ed. 1232, 1235, 1236, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 780. Negligence is all degree,-that of the defendant here degree of the nicest sort; and between the variations according to distance that I suppose to exist, and the simple universality of the rules in the Twelve Tables, or the Leges Barbarorum, there lies the culture of two thousand years.\n I am authorized to say that the CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in the opinion that I express. \n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEWIS v. FRICK(1914)\nNo. 208\nArgued: January 28, 1917Decided: April 6, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 291, 292]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Guy W. Moore, Philip T. Van Zile, Frederic S. Florian, and H. P. Wilson for petitioner.\n Assistant Attorney General Wallace for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n Petitioner is an alien and a native of Russia. He came thence to this country, entering at the port of New York, in the month of September, 1904, lived in or near New York city until March, 1901, then removed to Detroit, Michigan, and has since made that city his home. On November 17, 1910, he crossed the river from Detroit to Windsor, Canada, and brought back with him into the United States a woman, avowed by him to be his wife, but \n\n[233 U.S. 291, 293]\n\u00a0\n whose actual status was questioned, as will appear. A few days later he was arrested upon a warrant from the Department of Commerce and Labor, issued under the immigration act of February 20, 1907 [34 Stat. at L. 898, chap. 1134] as amended March 26, 1910 [36 Stat. at L. 263, chap. 128, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 501], and after a hearing conducted by an inspector, the Secretary, on February 14, 1911, found 'that said alien is a member of the excluded classes, in that he . . . procured, imported, and brought into the United States a woman for an immoral purpose,' etc., and thereupon ordered that he be deported to the country whence he came, to wit, Russia.\n Meanwhile, he was indicted in the United States district court for a violation of  3 of the act, the charge being that on the occasion above referred to he knowingly imported an alien woman from a foreign country for an immoral purpose, to wit, illicit concubinage and cohabitation. The trial of the indictment resulted, on March 23, 1911, in a verdict of not guilty.\n On April 13th petitioner, being in custody under the deportation warrant, sued out a writ of habeas corpus from the United States circuit court. Appended to his petition for the writ was a copy of the record of his examination by the inspector, including the testimony and a list of exhibits, but not the exhibits themselves. In his answer the immigration inspector set up the warrant of deportation as his authority for detaining petitioner, and recited the arrest and examination, and the finding of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor.\n The circuit court held that there was no authority in the immigration law for deporting an alien because he had imported a woman for immoral purposes; that such importation might be fully proved, or, indeed, might be admitted by the alien, and still the Department of Commerce and Labor would be without jurisdiction to deport; that it had such jurisdiction only under  3 of the act, and only in case of conviction; that because by  3 Congress \n\n[233 U.S. 291, 294]\n\u00a0\n provided that where the woman imported is an alien and the person importing is an alien, a felony is committed, and the person convicted of this felony may be deported, therefore under the ordinary rules of statutory construction it must be held that out of the general class covered by  2 Congress had selected a particular class named in  3, and subjected it to a severe punishment, but in connection therewith had limited the right to deport to cases where there was a conviction. That the right to prosecute criminally and the right to deport are inconsistent as concurrent rights, and cannot both be exercised at the same time; and that Congress saw the necessity of making the proceedings successive, and clearly made the second step depend upon the result of the first. Hence, an order was made for the discharge of petitioner. 189 Fed. 146.\n Upon appeal, the circuit court of appeals reversed this judgment (115 C. C. A. 493, 195 Fed. 693), holding that the power to deport an alien existed under  2 and 21 of the act, irrespective of  3; and further that the right to deport in this case could be found in  3 in connection with  21, without regard to conviction or acquittal under  3. The court also held that the acquittal of Lewis was not res judicata of the present proceeding, and that since there was evidence tending to support the finding of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor respecting the bringing in of the woman for the purpose of prostitution, that finding was conclusive. And, finally, it sustained the deportation of petitioner to Russia rather than to Canada, holding that the former was 'the country whence he came,' within the meaning of the act.\n The provisions that are especially pertinent are set forth in the margin. \n'An Act To Regulate the Immigration of Aliens into the United States,' approved February 20, 1907, chap. 1134, 34 Stat. at L. 898, as amended by act of March 26, 1910, chap. 128, 36 Stat. at L. 263, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 501.\n\n'Sec. 2. That the following classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission into the United States . . . persons who procure or attempt to bring in prostitutes, or women or girls for the purpose of prostitution, or for any other immoral purpose. . . .\n\n'Sec. 3. That the importation into the United States of any alien for the purpose of prostitution or for any other immoral purpose is hereby forbidden; and whoever shall, directly or indirectly, import, or attempt to import, into the United States, any alien for the purpose of prostitution or for any other immoral purpose, . . . shall, in every such case, be deemed guilty of a felony, and on conviction thereof be imprisoned not more than ten years and pay a fine of not more than five thousand dollars. . . . Any alien who shall be convicted under any of the provisions of this section shall, at the expiration of his sentence, be taken into custody and returned to the country whence he came, or of which he is a subject or a citizen, in the manner provided in sections twenty and twenty-one of this act. . . . \n\n[233 U.S. 291, 295]\n\u00a0\n The decision of the circuit court of appeals is attacked here on several grounds. The first is based upon the fact that the alien had an established domicil and residence in the United States dating from September 20, 1904, having obtained his admission into the country legally, and maintained a domicil here continuously from the date \n\n[233 U.S. 291, 296]\n\u00a0\n of his entry until the time of his arrest; and it is insisted that the fact of his having crossed the river to Canada, even though it was done with the object of bringing a woman into this country for the purpose of prostitution, did not bring him within the reach of the immigration act, or subject him to the summary procedure therein prescribed.\n\n This question is settled adversely to the contention of petitioner by out recent decision in Lapina v. Williams, \n232 U.S. 78\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 196. That case arose under the act of February 20, 1907, while this arises under the same act as amended March 26, 1910. But the changes are not such as to affect the authority of that decision upon the present point.\n In Lapina v. Williams it did appear that the alien had practised prostitution for many years before her temporary departure from the country, and that she not only returned with the intent to continue the practice, but did almost immediately engage in it, and continued it until her arrest under the provisions of the immigration act. But the real ground of decision was that Congress, in the act of 1903 [32 Stat. at L. 1213, chap. 1012], sufficiently expressed, and in the act of 1907 reiterated, the purpose of extending the prohibition against the admission of aliens of certain classes, and the mandate for their deportation, to all aliens within the descriptive terms of the excluding clause, irrespective of any qualification arising out of a previous residence or domicil in this country. This view was based (a) upon the legislative history of the act of 1903 (from which the material provisions of the 1907 act were taken), which was a re-enactment of previous laws, but with the deliberate omission of the word 'immigrant' and of certain other qualifying phrases that had been construed by the courts as giving so limited meaning to the word 'alien' as not to include aliens previously resident in this country, and who had temporarily departed with the intention of returning; (b) upon the clear language of the excluding clause of  2 \n\n[233 U.S. 291, 297]\n\u00a0\n of the act of 1907 (quoted in full, \n232 U.S. 91\n, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 200); ( c) upon the fact that none of the excluded classes (with the possible exception of contract laborers) would be any less undesirable if previously domiciled in the United States; and (d) upon the fact that the section contains its own specific provisos and limitations, which, upon familiar principles, tend to negative any other and implied exception.\n We hold, therefore, that the fact that the petitioner, Lewis, had been domiciled for six years or more in this country, he remaining still an alien, did not change his status so as to exempt him from the operation of the immigration act; and that if he departed from the country, even for a brief space of time, and on re-entering brought into the country a woman for the purpose of prostitution or other immoral purpose, he subjected himself to the operation of the clauses of the act that relate to the exclusion and deportation of aliens, the same as if he had had no previous residence or domicil in this country. In short, the period of three years from entry, prescribed by  20 and 21, runs not from the date when the alien first entered the country, but from the time of the prohibited entry; that is to say, in the present case, the entry made by the alien when bringing in the woman.\n The next question is whether there was sufficient evidence to fairly sustain the finding of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor to the effect that petitioner did, on November 17, 1910, import and bring into the United States a woman for an immoral purpose. Upon this question, petitioner's contention was and is, that the woman is in fact his wife. He testified that he married her in Warsaw shortly before he came from Russia to this country, and that when he brought her across the river from Windsor he intended that he and she should live together in Detroit as husband and wife. The conten- \n\n[233 U.S. 291, 298]\n\u00a0\n tion of respondent was and is, that the story of the marriage was a pure fabrication, resorted to in the effort to conceal the fact that the woman was a prostitute and imported by petitioner for immoral purposes. There is much in the evidence to support this view. Petitioner admitted that his real name was not Lewis, but Prezysuskier, and his 'other name' was Nossek; that he first used the name of Lewis after coming to this country; that his father's name was Chaskel Prezysuskier; that he knew hes alleged wife as 'Leah,' and did not know her other name, if any; that he knew her father as 'Isaac,' but did not know whether he had any other name; that two friends were present at the ceremony, but he could not remember their names; that he lived with the woman in Warsaw for five or six months, and then separated from her because he heard stories of improper conduct on her part, and that he afterwards heard she had had children before the marriage. Being questioned concerning his life in New York he professed himself unable to give the names of several persons among those with whom he said he had come in contact, and who could presumably have been called either to corroborate or to contradict his testimony. He declared that he had not seen his alleged wife since coming to America until the occasion when he met her at Windsor. Being asked 'How did you happen to meet her at that time?' he answered as follows: 'I was home not working one day and Berman comes up and asks for me and I don't know how he got my address and I was surprised that a strange man should ask for my name but my cousin, Mrs. Newman, told him he should come back at night when I got home from work and he came back and said 'I have regards for you' and he said 'Are you Lewis' and I said 'Yes' and he asked me questions, if I was ever in Warsaw and I said 'Yes,' and he said, 'I have regards from your wife' and I pretended to say that I haven't got any, because I kept myself single, but still \n\n[233 U.S. 291, 299]\n\u00a0\n when he mentioned the name I knew what it was and I said, 'Where is she, what does she want of me' and he said 'She is not here, she is in Canada, but I will let you know when she gets here.' On the 17th I went to work in the morning and at dinner time when I got back Mr. Berman was there waiting for me. I said, 'What is the matter' and he said, 'I received a telegram that my wife and your wife are coming here and I want you to come over with me to Windsor and meet them,' and I said, 'She will come over to the Immigration Office they should send for me over there and she could get out.' Well he said it was better for me to come over there, 'For you know how a woman is;' he said, 'She might make you trouble' and I didn't think about it, so I went there and met her and I went over to Windsor and stood there fifteen or twenty minutes and got a train to the station at Windsor and met her there but very cool and came over here to the Immigration Office.'\n The story is extraordinary. How it happened that the alleged wife, who had known him as Prezysuskier in Warsaw, was able through the good offices of an entire stranger to identify him as Lewis, in Detroit, more than six years later, was not explained. The alleged husband's readiness to accept her is equally suspicious. There were other circumstances tending to discredit the story of the marriage. And if that story fell, the inference of an unlawful purpose was irresistible. It should be mentioned that the exhibits introduced upon the examination on which the warrant of deportation was issued are not included in the record; but it does appear that among them was a statement made by the alien at police headquarters in Detroit on November 21, 1910. Were there doubt whether the testimony itself, without the documentary evidence, would support the action of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, we should be inclined to say that a court ought not set aside that action without at least requiring the \n\n[233 U.S. 291, 300]\n\u00a0\n production of the exhibits that were presented to the Secretary. But, without regard to them, enough appears to show that he was fully justified in concluding as a matter of fact that the whole story of the marriage in Warsaw was a fabrication, and that in truth Lewis went from Detroit to Windsor upon information from which he inferred that the woman was an alien and a prostitute, willing to accompany him to Detroit for an immoral purpose, and that he brought her to Detroit for that purpose.\n This being so, and there being no contention that the hearing was not fairly conducted, the finding of the Secretary upon the question of fact is binding upon the courts. Low Wah Suey v. Backus, \n225 \nU.S. 460, 468\n, 56 S. L. ed. 1165, 1167, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 734; Zakonaite v. Wolf, \n226 \nU.S. 272, 275\n, 57 S. L. ed. 218, 220, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 31.\n Respecting the construction of the act, we cannot assent to the view entertained by the circuit court. Section 2 declares that certain classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission into the United States, and among them 'persons who procure or attempt to bring in prostitutes or women or girls for the purpose of prostitution or for any other immoral purpose.' This section applies only where an alien brings in a woman or girl for the purpose indicated. It does not declare that the woman or girl need be an alien. Section 3 prohibits the importation of 'any alien' for the purpose of prostitution or for any other immoral purpose. Of course, in order to constitute an offense against this section, the person brought in must be an alien. But the person need not be a woman or girl. This is clear from the changes made by Congress in  3 when amending it in 1910. The section as it stood in the 1907 act (34 Stat. at L. 899, chap. 1134, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1909, p. 450) forbade and rendered felonious the importation or attempt to import 'any alien woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or for any other immoral purpose;' the phrase 'alien woman or girl' being repeated in other \n\n[233 U.S. 291, 301]\n\u00a0\n clauses of the section; and one of the principal changes made in 1910 (36 Stat. at L. 264, chap. 128, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 502) was to eliminate the words 'woman or girl,' so that now the section prohibits the importation of 'any alien' for the purposes referred to, and declares that whoever shall import or attempt to import 'any alien for the purpose,' etc ., or shall hold or attempt to hold 'any alien' for any such purpose, etc., or shall keep, etc., in pursuance of such illegal importation, 'any alien,' shall be deemed guilty of a felony. The purpose of the amendment is not to be mistaken. Moreover, the offense is made a felony irrespective of whether it is committed by an alien or by a citizen of this country, the only difference being that by one of the clauses any alien convicted under this section is, after the expiration of his sentence, to be returned to the country whence he came, or of which he is a subject or a citizen.\n Again,  20 provides 'that any alien who shall enter the United States in violation of law' shall be deported 'at any time within three years after the date of his entry into the United States.' This certainly includes those who enter in violation of  2; indeed, violators of  3 may not have 'entered' at all, within the meaning of the act.\n Consequently, we deem that the circuit court erred in holding that the act does not provide for deporting an alien for the offense of procuring or attempting to bring in prostitutes, etc., in the absence of a conviction for the felony under  3. Section 2, read in connection with  20 and 21, is not thus conditioned. And, as just now pointed out, the offense aimed at in  2 and that which is punishable under  3 are not the same. In short, it cannot be said that out of a general class covered by  2, Congress selected the particular class named in  3, for the latter class is not entirely included within the former.\n We agree with the circuit court of appeals that the \n\n[233 U.S. 291, 302]\n\u00a0\n verdict and judgment acquitting petitioner under the indictment does not render the present controversy res judicata. The issue presented by the traverse of the indictment was not identical with the matter determined by the Secretary of Commerce and Labor. And, besides, the acquittal under the indictment was not equivalent to an affirmative finding of innocence, but merely to an adjudication that the proof was not sufficient to overcome all reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. The distinction between a criminal prosecution and an administrative inquiry by an executive department or subordinate officers thereof has been often pointed out. Zakonaite v. Wolf, \n226 \nU.S. 272, 275\n, 57 S. L. ed. 218, 220, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 31, and cases cited; Williams v. United States, 108 C. C. A. 457, 186 Fed. 479.\n The final contention is that petitioner should have been deported to Canada, whence he came upon the occasion of his unlawful entry into this country, rather than to Russia, the land of his birth, from which he came six years earlier. By  20, the alien is to be 'deported to the country whence he came at any time within three years after the date of his entry into the United States;' by  21, the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, upon being satisfied that an alien is subject to deportation, 'shall cause such alien within the period of three years after landing or entry therein [ within the United States] to be taken into custody and returned to the country whence he came, as provided by section twenty of this act;' by  3, an alien convicted thereunder is, at the expiration of his sentence, to be 'returned to the country whence he came, or of which he is a subject or citizen, in the manner provided in sections twenty and twenty-one of this act;' and by  35, 'The deportation of aliens arrested within the United States after entry and found to be illegally therein, provided for in this act, shall be to the trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific ports from which said aliens embarked for the United States; or if such embarka- \n\n[233 U.S. 291, 303]\n\u00a0\n tion was for foreign contiguous territory, to the foreign port at which said aliens embarked for such territory.'\n Petitioner not having been convicted under  3, his destination is to be determined rather in the light of  20, 21, and 35. And first, we take it to be clear (notwithstanding the peculiar phraseology of  20) that the three-year period limits only the authority to deport, and does not affect the determination of the country to which an alien is to be deported. Respecting this matter, the sections are somewhat lacking in clearness. But, at least,  35 indicates a legislative intent that aliens subject to deportation shall be taken to trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific ports, if they came thence, rather than to foreign territory on this continent, although it may have been crossed on the way to this country. This was recognized by Rule 38 of the Immigration Regulations, in force December 12, 1910\n\n\n It is to be noted that the classes of aliens who are subject to deportation are not wholly made up of those who enter in violation of the law; in some cases cause for deportation may arise after a lawful entry. And in many cases the unlawfulness of the entry may not be discovered until afterwards. The theory of the act, as expressed in  2, is that the undesirables ought to be excluded at the seaport or at the frontier; but  20, 21, and 35 recognize that this is not always practicable. Of course, if petitioner's attempt to bring a woman into the country for an immoral purpose had been discovered in time, he might have been physically excluded from entry at Detroit upon his return from Windsor. In that event he would naturally have remained upon Canadian soil. But since his offense was not discovered in time to permit of his physical exclusion, so that he becomes subject to the provisions for deportation, his destination ought not be to controlled by the factitious circumstance that he went into Canada to procure the prostitute. And, upon the whole, it seems to \n\n[233 U.S. 291, 304]\n\u00a0\n us that the act reasonably admits of his being returned to the land of his nativity, that being in fact 'the country whence he came' when he first entered the United States. See Lavin v. Le Fevre, 60 C. C. A. 425, 125 Fed. 693, 696; Ex parte Hamaguchi, 161 Fed. 185, 190; Ex parte Wong You, 176 Fed. 933, 940; United States v. Ruiz, 121 C. C. A. 551, 203 Fed. 441, 444. We need go no further, and may therefore leave undecided the question whether the act leaves any room for discretion on the part of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor.\n We have assumed, without deciding, that that part of the deportation order which determines the destination of the alien is open to inquiry upon habeas corpus\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n 'Sec. 20.

DAVIS(1914)\nNo. 247\nArgued: Decided: May 11, 1914\n\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 613, 614]\n\u00a0\n This case arises out of conflicting claims to 80 acres of land in O'Brien county, Iowa, under the act of March 3, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 556, chap. 376, (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1595), as amended February 12, 1896 ( 29 Stat. at L. 6, chap. 18, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1596), providing for the adjustment of railroad land grants, etc. The land is within the place limits of the grant made May 12, 1864 (13 Stat. at L. 72, chap. 84), to the state of Iowa to aid in the construction of a railroad from Sioux City, in that state, to the southern boundary of Minnesota. The grant was in praesenti and embraced every alternate section, designated by odd numbers, for ten sections in width on each side of the road, with the usual exceptions and provision for indemnity. The company which was to construct the road and receive the benefit of the grant was to be designated by the state legislature. Upon the presentation of a certificate by the governor of the state that any section of 10 consecutive miles of the road was completed, the Secretary of the Interior was to issue to the state patents for 100 sections of land 'for the benefit of' the company constructing the road, and this was to be repeated as each additional 10 miles was constructed until the entire road was completed and all the lands patented. If the road was not completed within ten years from the company's acceptance of the grant, \n\n[233 U.S. 613, 615]\n\u00a0\n the lands 'granted and not patented' were to revert to the state, to enable it to secure the completion of the work; and if the road was not completed within five years after the expiration of the ten years, then the 'lands undisposed of' were to revert to the United States. The Sioux City  St. Paul Railroad Company was designated by the state legislature as the beneficiary of the grant in 1866, the company accepted it in the same year, and a map definitely locating the line of the road was filed with the Secretary of the Interior and approved in 1867. As so located, the road was about 80 miles in length. In 1872 the company constructed it from the southern boundary of Minnesota to LeMars, Iowa, a distance of 56. 25 miles, but the remaining part was never constructed, a trackage right to Sioux City over another road being acquired by the company. In 1872 and 1873 the governor certified that five sections of 10 miles each, constituting 50 miles of continuous road from the southern boundary of Minnesota, had been completed and put into operation conformably to the granting act, and the Secretary of the Interior thereupon caused a large amount of lands within the primary and indemnity limits of the grant to be patented to the state 'for the use and benefit of' the company, the tract in controversy being among those so patented. Most of the lands patented to the state were soon conveyed by it to the company, but some were not, this tract being among the latter. The company, however, was claiming it in virtue of the grant and the patent to the state. Litigation was had between this company and another, by reason of their overlapping land grants, to determine which was entitled to this tract and others within the overlap, and by the final decree in 1886 this tract was awarded to this company. Sioux City  St. P. R. Co. v. Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. \n117 U.S. 406\n, 29 L. ed. 928, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 790. In truth, more land was patented to the state for the benefit of the company, and more land was conveyed by the state to the company, than the latter was entitled to \n\n[233 U.S. 613, 616]\n\u00a0\n receive for the five 10-mile sections of completed road, not counting the additional 6.25 miles, and in 1882 the state legislature passed an act declaring that the state thereby resumed all lands 'which have not been earned' by the company, but the act did not more definitely point out the lands intended to be resumed. Iowa Laws 1882, chap. 107. And in 1884 the state legislature passed an act declaring ( 1) that all lands resumed and intended to be resumed by the act of 1882 'are hereby relinquished and conveyed to the United States,' and also ( 2): 'The governor of the state of Iowa is hereby authorized and directed to certify to the Secretary of the Interior all lands which have heretofore been patented to the state, to aid in the construction of said railroad, and which have not been patented by the state to the Sioux City  St. Paul Railroad Company, and the list of land so certified by the governor shall be presumed to be the lands relinquished and conveyed by  1 of this act. Provided, that nothing in this section contained shall be construed to apply to lands situated in the counties of Dickinson and O'Brien.' Iowa Laws 1884, chap. 71. The tract in controversy, being in O'Brien county, came within the excepting words of the proviso.\n This tract was part of an odd-numbered section of land immediately adjoining the third 10-mile section of constructed road, the completion of which was duly certified by the governor, and was unreserved, unappropriated, and vacant at the date of the granting act and at the time the line of road was definitely located. Thus it was not only a part of the lands granted, but was earned by actual construction. And, strictly speaking, it was rightly patented to the state for the benefit of the company, the excess in the lands patented being caused by the inclusion in the patents of other lands differently situated and not earned by the completion of the five 10-mile sections of road.\n September 11, 1888, while the tract was still free from \n\n[233 U.S. 613, 617]\n\u00a0\n any homestead, pre-emption, or kindred claim, and while the patent therefor, issued to the state in 1873, for the benefit of the company, was still outstanding, Ellen M. Childs purchased the tract from the company, paying $8 in cash and agreeing to pay ten deferred instalments, with interest thereon, making the full price $1,270.64, which was the fair value of the land. At the time of her purchase the tract was in the actual and undisputed possession of the company through a tenant named Fitzgerald, who then became her tenant, and through him she continued in the undisturbed possession until October 8, 1889, when she sold to Logan, the plaintiff in error, who paid her $228 in cash and took the land subject to the payment of the ten deferred instalments. Fitzgerald then became the tenant of Logan and remained in possession in that capacity until the spring of 1890, when Davis, the defendant in error, with a gang of men and teams, went upon the land, took possession of it, and began cultivating the larger part of it. In what he did Davis acted without the consent of Logan, and with knowledge of Mrs. Childs's purchase from the company in 1888, of her sale to Logan in 1889, and of Fitzgerald's possession as tenant of Mrs. Childs and then of Logan. Although subsequently maintaining the possession obtained in the spring of 1890, Davis did not reside upon the tract or erect any buildings upon it.\n In October, 1889, the United States brought a suit-the bill was filed October 4 and the subpoena was served October 8-against the company under the adjustment act of March 3, 1887, supra, to regain the title to nearly 22,000 acres of land in Dickinson and O'Brien counties, including this tract, theretofore patented to the state for the benefit of the company, the theory upon which such relief was sought being that the company had received a larger quantity of other lands than it was entitled to receive under the granting act, and therefore \n\n[233 U.S. 613, 618]\n\u00a0\n could not properly claim the 22,000 acres. In the circuit court the United States prevailed, and this court affirmed the decree. Sioux City & St. P. R. Co. v. United States, \n159 U.S. 349\n, 40 L. ed. 177, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 17. The ground upon which the decision rested is indicated by the following extract from the opinion (p. 370): 'Our conclusion, then, is that the Sioux City Company, having failed to complete the entire road for the construction of which Congress made the grant in question, was not entitled to the whole of the lands granted, but, at most, only to one hundred odd-numbered sections-as those sections were surveyed, whatever their quantity-for each section of 10 consecutive miles constructed and certified by the governor of the state; and that, according to the measurement of 1887, which is accepted as the basis of calculation, the railroad company had, prior to the institution of this suit, received more lands, on account of the 50 miles of constructed road, certified by the governor, than it was entitled to receive. Under this view, it is unnecessary to inquire whether the particular lands here in dispute should not have been assigned to the company, rather than other lands, containing a like number of acres, that were, in fact, transferred to it, and which cannot now be recovered by the United States, by reason of their having been disposed of by the company. If the company has received as much in quantity as should have been awarded to it, a court of equity will not recognize its claim to more, in whatever shape the claim is presented.'\n There was no attempt to make Mrs. Childs, Logan, or the tenant Fitzgerald a party to that suit. During its pendency, and on March 13, 1894, Logan entered into an agreement in writing with the company whereby the latter extended the time for paying the ten deferred instalments until ninety days after a decision should be rendered in the suit by this court, and whereby he agreed that if the decision should be adverse to the company, he would ac- \n\n[233 U.S. 613, 619]\n\u00a0\n cept from it the amount already paid, with interest, in full satisfaction of all demands against the company on account of the failure of the title.\n Shortly following the decision of this court in that suit the lands recovered by the United States, including this tract, were regularly restored to public entry in conformity with the provisions of the adjustment act, and a contest at once ensued in the Land Department over this tract. Logan, claiming to be a purchaser in good faith, applied for a confirmatory patent under  4, and Davis, claiming to be a bona fide occupant, sought to obtain title under the homestead law. A hearing before the local land office, at which the parties presented such evidence as they had in support of their respective claims, resulted in a decision by the local officers in favor of Davis. This was affirmed by the Commissioner of the General Land Office on the theory that the agreement of March 13, 1894, was fatal to Logan's claim as a purchaser; and upon an appeal to the Secretary of the Interior the decisions below were reversed, it being found and held by the Secretary that Logan was a purchaser in good faith within the meaning of  4 of the adjustment act; that the agreement of March 13, 1894, did not alter his status as a purchaser; and that Davis's possession, acquired after the purchase by Logan, and with knowledge of it, did not eliminate the element of good faith from the latter's purchase, or otherwise defeat his claim. As a result of this decision, Logan made the requisite payment to the government (see amendatory act of February 12, 1896, supra), and was given a confirmatory patent.\n It is conceded that Mrs. Childs and Logan were both citizens of the United States, and in that respect within the remedial provisions of  4 of the adjustment act, and also that in the contest before the Land Department Logan testified that at the time of his purchase from Mrs. Childs, in 1889, he had no knowledge of any adverse claim to the \n\n[233 U.S. 613, 620]\n\u00a0\n tract. The present record, however, does not purport to contain all the evidence produced in that contest.\n When the proceeding in the Land Department was concluded, Logan sued Davis in the local state court to recover the possession, and by the pleadings subsequent to the petition the character of the action was so far changed that Davis sought to have Logan declared a trustee of the title for him, Davis, and directed to convey the same to him, and Logan sought to have his title quieted as against Davis, as well as to recover the possession. In Davis's pleading Logan's right under the confirmatory patent was assailed upon the grounds (1) that the grant of 1864 was completely and finally adjusted by the legislation and action of the state in 1882 and 1884, and so was not within the operation of the adjustment act of 1887; (2) that the remedial provisions of  4 of that act were confined to purchases made prior to the date of the act, and so were not applicable to Mrs. Childs' purchase chase in 1888 or Logan's purchase in 1889; (3) that Mrs. Childs and Logan were bound to take notice of the various acts and matters bearing upon the company's right to this tract, and so it was legally impossible for either to be a purchaser in good faith within the meaning of  4; and (4) that the decision of the Secretary of the Interior, reversing the action of the local officers and of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, was given 'unlawfully and without any authority of law.' The last ground evidently was intended as a mere conclusion from the others, for nothing else was alleged to make it even colorable. The case was heard upon an agreed statement of facts, the substance of which has been recited, and a decree was rendered in favor of Davis, which was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 147 Iowa, 441, 124 N. W. 808. That court held that Logan was not a purchaser in good faith within the meaning of  4 of the adjustment act of 1887, and this upon the theory (a) that he was presumed to have \n\n[233 U.S. 613, 621]\n\u00a0\n known the character of the company's title, and (b) that  4 was not applicable to a purchase made after the date of the act. To reverse that decision Logan prosecutes this writ of error.\n Messrs. William Milchrist, George C. Scott, and W. D. Boies for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Madison B. Davis and Edwin J. Stason for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Van Devanter:\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n As Logan claimed as a purchaser in good faith within the meaning of  4 of the adjustment act of 1887, under which a confirmatory patent had been issued to him, and the supreme court of the state denied that claim, and held that he was not entitled to the benefit of the provisions of that section, the judgment is so plainly subject to review by this court under  237 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 227] that a contention to the contrary, found in one of the briefs, is dismissed as not justifying further comment. Gauthier v. Morrison, \n232 U.S. 452\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 384.\n And as the Secretary of the Interior found, from the evidence submitted in the contest before the Land Department, that Logan was a purchaser in good faith in the sense of the adjustment act, and no basis was laid in the pleadings or agreed statement of facts for rejecting or disturbing that decision save as it was said to be grounded upon error of law and misconstruction of the statute, it is manifest that unless some of the objections urged against it on that score are well taken, Logan's title should be sustained. Vance v. Burbank, \n101 \nU.S. 514, 519\n, 25 S. L. ed. 929, 931; Lee v. Johnson, \n116 U.S. 48\n, 29 L. ed. 570, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249; Gertgens v. O'Connor, \n191 \nU.S. 237, 240\n, 48 S. L. ed. 163, 164, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 94; Ross v. Day, \n232 \nU.S. 110, 116\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 233.\n The act of 1887, in its 1st section, authorized and required the Secretary of the Interior immediately to adjust, in accordance with the decisions of this court, the several land grants made by Congress to aid in the construction of railroads, 'and heretofore unadjusted.' This included \n\n\n[233 U.S. 613, 624]\n\u00a0\n the grant made by the act of 1864, unless already adjusted. That it had not been adjusted by the Land Department is conceded, but it is insisted that it had been adjusted by the legislation and action of the state in 1882 and 1884, and so was not within the operation of the adjustment act of 1887. To this we cannot assent. The United States had not committed the adjustment to the state, and neither had the state assumed to make an adjustment for the United States. Prior to the act of 1887 the administration of the several railroad land grants rested with the Land Department, of which the Secretary of the Interior is the head (Catholic Bishop v. Gibbon, \n158 \nU.S. 155, 166\n, 167 S., 39 L. ed. 931, 936, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 779, and some of the lessor grants had progressed to a final adjustment in regular course of administration. It was because of this that the restrictive words 'and heretofore unadjusted' were inserted in the act. They meant only that adjustments theretofore effected by the Land Department in regular course were not to be disturbed. The facts before recited amply illustrate that this grant had not proceeded to such an adjustment. The Secretary of the Interior treated it as unadjusted (Re Sioux City & St. P. R. Co. 6 Land Dec. 54, 71), and this court impliedly, if not expressly, approved his action (Sioux City & St. P. R. Co. v. United States, \n159 U.S. 349\n, 40 L. ed. 177, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 17).\n The 2d section of the act of 1887 related to the recovery by the United States of lands which, upon the completion of any adjustment, or sooner, appeared to have been erroneously certified or patented by the Land Department 'to or for the use of benefit of any company' claiming under a grant to aid in the construction of a railroad. The 3d section related to the reinstatement of pre-emption and homestead entries found, in the course of any adjustment, to have been erroneously canceled by reason of such a grant or a withdrawal, and directed that where the entryman failed to apply for a reinstatement within a \n\n[233 U.S. 613, 625]\n\u00a0\n reasonable time, to be fixed by the Secretary of the Interior, the land should be disposed of under the public land laws to bona fide purchasers, if any, and, if there were none, then to bona fide settlers. The fourth section read as follows:\n'That as to all lands, except those mentioned in the foregoing section, which have been so erroneously certified or patented as aforesaid, and which have been sold by the grantee company to citizens of the United States, or to persons who have declared their intention to become such citizens, the person or persons so purchasing in good faith, his heirs or assigns, shall be entitled to the land so purchased, upon making proof of the fact of such purchase at the proper land office, within such time and under such rules as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, after the grants respectively shall have been adjusted; and patents of the United States shall issue therefor, and shall relate back to the date of the original certification or patenting, and the Secretary of the Interior, on behalf of the United States, shall demand payment from the company which has so disposed of such lands of an amount equal to the government price of similar lands; and in case of neglect or refusal of such company to make payment as hereafter specified, within ninety days after the demand shall have been made, the Attorney General shall cause suit or suits to be brought against such company for the said amount: Provided, That nothing in this act shall prevent any purchaser of lands erroneously withdrawn, certified, or patented as aforesaid from recovering the purchase money therefor from the grantee company, less the amount paid to the United States by such company, as by this act required: And provided, That a mortgage or pledge of said lands by the company shall not be considered as a sale for the purpose of this act, nor shall this act be construed as a declaration of forfeiture of any portion of any land grant for conditions broken, or as au- \n\n[233 U.S. 613, 626]\n\u00a0\n thorizing an entry for the same, or as a waiver of any rights that the United States may have on account of any breach of said conditions.'\n\n This section was amended February 12, 1896 (29 Stat. at L. 6, chap. 18), by adding to it the following:\n'Provided further, That where such purchasers, their heirs or assigns, have paid only a portion, of the purchase price to the company, which is less than the government price of similar lands, they shall be required, before the delivery of patent for their lands, to pay to the government a sum equal to the difference between the portion of the purchase price so paid and the government price, and in such case the amount demanded from the company shall be the amount paid to it by such purchaser.'\n\n Section 5 related to lands apparently within such a grant and lying opposite the constructed parts of the road, but excepted from the operation of the grant, and not certified or patented to or for the benefit of the railroad company, and provided that where any such land was sold by the company to a bona fide purchaser, who was a citizen of the United States, or had declared his intention to become such, the purchaser, his heirs or assigns, could obtain a patent by paying the ordinary government price, but that this privilege should not exist if, at the time of the sale by the company, the land was occupied by an adverse claimant under the pre-emption or homestead laws.\n Whether  4 was confined to purchases made prior to the date of the act, or equally included subsequent purchases, where made in good faith, is one of the controverted questions in the case. Both views have support in the terms of the act, and if the question were altogether new there would be room for a reasonable difference of opinion as to what was intended. Certainly, resort to interpretation would be necessary. But the question is not altogether new. It has often arisen in the administration of the act, and successive Secretaries of the Interior uniformly have \n\n[233 U.S. 613, 627]\n\u00a0\n held that the remedial sections embraced purchases after the date of the act, no less than prior purchases, if made in good faith. Sethman v. Clise, 17 Land Dec. 307; Holton v. Rutledge, 20 Land Dec. 227; Andrus v. Balch, 22 Land Dec. 238; Briley v. Beach, 22 Land Dec. 549; Re Seaver, 23 Land Dec. 108; Neilsen v. Central P. R. Co. 26 Land Dec. 252. Many thousands of acres have been patented to individuals under that interpretation, and to disturb it now would be productive of serious and harmful results. The situation, therefore, calls for the application of the settled rule that the practical interpretation of an ambiguous or uncertain statute by the executive department charged with its administration is entitled to the highest respect, and, if acted upon for a number of years, will not be disturbed except for very cogent reasons.

Rep. 285, which involved several purchases made after the date of the act, and it was there said: 'But the act itself bears upon its face evidence that it was not intended to be limited to cases of purchases from the railroad company prior to its date.' And, after referring to the language of  2 and 3, it was added: 'This seems to imply an intent that all mistakes of the nature referred to which shall have occurred up to the very completion of the adjustment may be rectified. Section 4 makes provision for the issue of patents to certain purchasers from railroad companies, providing proof shall be made 'within such time and under such rules as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, after the grants respectively shall have been adjusted.' While other sections may not be so specific, yet, placing them \n\n[233 U.S. 613, 628]\n\u00a0\n alongside of those from which quotations have been made, it is reasonable to hold that the act applies not merely to transactions had before its date, but to any had before the time of final adjustment. In this case the several grants to the Southern Pacific have not yet been finally adjusted. Further, it must be borne in mind that this is a remedial statute, and is to be construed liberally, and so as to effectuate the purpose of Congress and secure the relief which was designed, and the mere date of the transaction between the purchaser and the railroad company is not of itself vital in determining whether there is or is not an equity in behalf of the purchaser.'\n Counsel for Davis rely upon Knepper v. Sands, \n194 U.S. 476\n, 48 L. ed. 1083, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 744, as placing a different interpretation upon the adjustment act. But, although some broad language is found in the opinion, the real decision did not go as far as suggested. The case came here upon a certificate from a circuit court of appeals, and the question presented for decision, considering the facts stated in the certificate, was whether a purchase from the railroad company of land erroneously patented for its benefit under the grant of 1864, could be esteemed a purchase in good faith, within the meaning of  4 of the act of 1887, where, at the time of the purchase, the land was occupied by a bona fide settler who was residing upon, improving and cultivating the same with a view to acquiring it under the homestead law. The question was answered in the negative, particular emphasis being laid upon the settler's occupancy at the time of the purchase and upon the well known policy of favoring actual settlers. The answer must have been the same whether the purchase was before or after the date of the act, and manifestly there was no purpose to overrule or qualify the decision in United States v. Southern P. R. Co. supra, for it was not even mentioned. So, reading the opinion in Knepper v. Sands with appropriate regard for the facts of the case, we think it is not in point \n\n[233 U.S. 613, 629]\n\u00a0\n or controlling here, for no one was occupying or claiming this tract under the settlement laws at the time it was purchased from the company.\n The contention that Logan was charged with constructive notice of the defect in the company's title, and so was not a purchaser in good faith, in the sense of the adjustment act, must be overruled, as was a like contention in United States v. Winona & St. P. R. Co. \n165 U.S. 463\n, 41 L. ed. 789, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 368. It was there said, referring to the remedial provisions of  4 (p. 480): 'It will be observed that this protection is not granted to simply bona fide purchasers (using that term in the technical sense), but to those who have one of the elements declared to be essential to a bona fide purchaser; to wit, good faith. It matters not what constructive notice may be chargeable to such a purchaser if, in actual ignorance of any defect in the railroad company's title, and in reliance upon the action of the government in the apparent transfer of title by certification or patent, he has made an honest purchase of the lands. The plain intent of this section is to secure him the lands, and to reinforce his defective title by a direct patent from the United States, and to leave to the government a simple claim for money against the railroad company.' And, referring to the provisions of  5, it was further said (p. 481): 'It is true the term used here is 'bona fide purchaser,' but it is a bona fide purchaser from the company, and the description given of the lands, as not conveyed and 'for any reason excepted from the operation of the grant,' indicates that the fact of notice of defect of title was not to be considered fatal to the right. Congress attempted to protect an honest transaction between a purchaser and a railroad company, even in the absence of a certification or patent.' This view of the purpose and meaning of the act was repeated and applied in Gertgens v. O'Connor, \n191 U.S. 237\n, 48 L. ed. 163, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 94, and United States v. Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. \n195 U.S. 524\n, 49 L. ed. 306, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 113. \n\n[233 U.S. 613, 630]\n\u00a0\n As it thus appears that the decision of the Secretary of the Interior was right in point of law, and as it was conclusive upon all questions of fact (Gertgens v. O'Connor, supra), it follows that the state court erred in not sustaining Logan's title obtained under that desision.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUIS DEJONGE & CO. v.

Stat .  4952, 4970, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3406, 3416; act of June 18, 1874, chap. 301, 18 Stat. at L. 78, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3411. The work alleged to be infringed was described as a painting repre- \n\n[235 U.S. 33, 36]\n\u00a0\n senting sprigs of holly, mistletoe, and spruce, arranged in the form of an open cluster having substantially the outline of a square. It was exhibited in court, was a water color painting in fact, and no doubt might have been framed and used for the same purposes of pleasure as other more considerable works of art. But it was so designed that it could be reproduced in repetitions that fitted and continued one another side by side and above and below, and was reproduced in that way with twelve repetitions upon strips of paper having much the look of wall paper, and intended to be used in covering or wrapping boxes during the holiday season. Each strip bore a single notice of copyright. The circuit court, assuming that infringement was established, was of opinion that the work was a painting, capable of copyright, and also a design, patentable as such, but held that, as the appellant had elected to copyright, the notice must be repeated on each of the twelve squares, although they did not present themselves as separate squares on the continuous strip. 182 Fed. 150. The circuit court of appeals, reserving its opinion as to whether the sphere of copyright and patent for design overlapped, agreed with the circuit court that, if this was a painting, every reproduction of it must bear the statutory notice, and affirmed the dismissal of the bill. 111 C. C. A. 567, 191 Fed. 35.\n It seems to us that the case is disposed of by the statement. The thing protected and the only thing was the painting, the whole of which was reproduced in a single square.

It is suggested that it is overtechnical to require a repetition of the notice upon every square in a single sheet that makes a harmonious whole. This argument tacitly assumes that we can look to such larger unity as the sheet possesses. But that unity is only the unity of a design that is not patented. \n\n[235 U.S. 33, 37]\n\u00a0\n The protected object does not gain more extensive privileges by being repeated several times upon one sheet of paper, as anyone would recognize if it were the Gioconda.

Art. 1,  10.\n The suit was brought by the mayor of the city of New Orleans, in his official capacity, to restrain the Louisiana Railway & Navigation Company from proceeding under a municipal ordinance-No. 1997, New Council Series, dated September 4, 1903-to construct and operate tracks over a public belt railroad reservation, and from operating cars, etc., over public belt railroad tracks, and to have the ordinance, so far as it granted to that company such privileges of construction and operation, declared null and void. The facts, so far as it is necessary to state them, are these:\n The authorities of the city of New Orleans devised the plan of establishing a public belt railroad along the river front. On March 1, 1899, the city adopted an ordinance (No. 15,080, C. S.) under which, in consideration of certain concessions, the Illinois Central Railroad Company built about 2 miles of the projected system, that is, from the upper limit of the city to the upper boundary of Audubon park. This was followed by ordinance No. 147, N. C. S., adopted August 7, 1900, which created a belt railroad board, composed of the mayor and certain city officials, to construct, control, and operate the belt railroad for the benefit of the city; and on August 12, 1902, the board of commissioners of the port of New Orleans, called the 'dock board,'-a body exercising state authority over a part of the area to be traversed by the proposed road,- approved the dedication for the purpose stated. This approval was to remain in force only so long as the belt railroad was 'operated and controlled by a public commission' in accordance with the provisions of ordinance No. 147.\n On February 10, 1903, a further ordinance was adopted-No. 1615, N. C. S.-which, among other things, granted to the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company \n\n[235 U.S. 164, 167]\n\u00a0\n a right of way over the belt line and reservation from the upper limit of the city to Henderson street. The condition was that the company, at its own expense, should construct and dedicate to perpetual public use the tracks as projected from the end of the line already built, on the upper side of Audubon park, to Henderson street ( a distance of about 5 miles), the construction to be completed before July 1, 1904. Other provisions looked to still further construction through contributions from other railroads. The validity of this ordinance was at once challenged in a suit brought by the mayor, on behalf of the city, which resulted in favor of the railroad company. Capdevielle v. New Orleans & S. F. R. Co. 110 La. 904, 34 So. 868. The terms of the ordinance, however, did not conform to the conditions upon which the dock board had consented to the building of the belt road, and, in a suit brought by that board against the railroad company, the carrying out of ordinance No. 1615 was restrained so far as it authorized the construction of the railroad upon the property subject to the board's jurisdiction. New Orleans v. New Orleans & S. F. R. Co. 112 La. 1011, 36 So. 837. Following this decision, it appears that the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company abandoned the building of the belt line contemplated by the ordinance; no part of it was constructed thereunder.\n On September 4, 1903, while the suit of the dock board was pending, and after the final decision in the Capdevielle suit, the city adopted ordinance No. 1997, N. C. S.,-the ordinance here in question (127 La. pp. 784-792, 54 So. 25). Without passing now upon points in controversy, it may be said that this ordinance, reciting that under ordinance No. 1615 there had already been granted to the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company the right to construct the belt line over the reservation from the place at which the rails then terminated to Henderson street, \n\n[235 U.S. 164, 168]\n\u00a0\n granted to the Louisiana Railway & Navigation Company-the plaintiff in error-a right of way over 'the double track belt line and reservation' to that point, upon stated terms and conditions, among which may be noted the following: That when the plaintiff in error had operated its equipment over the described belt tracks for thirty days, it should pay to the city the sum of $50,000; that in case the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad company failed 'without legal excuse' to build the described line to Henderson street, as provided in ordinance No. 1615, the plaintiff in error should build that line in place of the first-mentioned company-this construction to be in lieu of the payment of $50,000, and the belt tracks so built, as soon as completed to Henderson street, to be 'turned over to the immediate ownership of the city of New Orleans,' and to be under 'the control and management of the public belt authority;' and, further, that in case the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company should, from any cause, complete only a portion of the described tracks, the plaintiff in error should have the right to use so much of the described belt line as had been built, on payment of a proportionate part of the specified sum. This ordinance the plaintiff in error formally accepted on September 17, 1903\n\n\n The suit brought by the dock board against the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company was decided by the supreme court of the state in May, 1904, and, in the October following, the city adopted ordinance No. 2683, N. C. S., which made comprehensive provision for municipal construction and operation of the belt line system. All conflicting ordinances were repealed, and it cannot be doubted that this ordinance, if enforced, would make it impossible for the plaintiff in error to exercise the rights it might otherwise have under ordinance No. 1997. The belt board was reorganized by the establishment of a new public belt railroad commission, com- \n\n[235 U.S. 164, 169]\n\u00a0\n posed of the mayor and sixteen 'citizen taxpayers,' to whom was confided the necessary administrative authority for carrying out the municipal scheme. This ordinance received the approval of the dock board on stated conditions, and, on July 1, 1905, the new undertaking was formally inaugurated. On November 10, 1905, the plaintiff in error deposited with a trust company, which was one of the fiscal agents of the city, $50,000 in securities in alleged compliance with its contract under ordinance No. 1997. The city, however, went on with its own plan, arranging for bank credits to enable it to carry on the work under ordinance No. 2683, and when, in May, 1906, the plaintiff in error attempted to begin construction under the earlier ordinance, it was stopped by the city authorities. Soon after, the present suit was instituted.\n The petition of the mayor, alleging upon various grounds the invalidity of ordinance No. 1997, also averred the adoption of ordinance No. 2683, the irrevocable dedication thereby for the reservation of the public belt railroad, and the undertaking by the city, under that ordinance, of the work of construction. The plaintiff in error, in its answer, set up the unconstitutionality of the later ordinance as one impairing contractual obligations. At the beginning of the suit a preliminary injunction was granted, in accordance with the city's prayer, and the city proceeded with the construction of the public belt railroad, which has since been put in operation. In the court of first instance, judgment went 'in favor of the plaintiff, Martin Behrman, in his official capacity of mayor of the city of New Orleans, and as ex-officio president of the public belt railroad commission of the city,' declaring ordinance No. 1997, so far as it purported to grant the privileges in dispute, to be 'illegal, void, and of no effect,' and making the injunction permanent. This judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state upon the ground that the contract was 'subject to a suspensive \n\n[235 U.S. 164, 170]\n\u00a0\n CONDITION, AND THAT THIS CONDITION HAD BEcome impossible of realization, and the contract had, in consequence, fallen through, when plaintiff made its attempt to begin work and the injunction was taken.' 127 La. 775, 795, 796.\n The defendant in error moves to dismiss, invoking the established rule that, where the state court gives no effect to the subsequent enactment, the jurisdiction of this court does not attach.

It is equally well settled that, where the state court does give effect to later legislation which operates to impair the obligation of a contract if one exists, this court is not deprived of jurisdiction because the state court has put its decision upon the ground that the contract was not made, or that it was invalid, or that it has become inoperative. In such a case, this court must determine for itself whether there is an existing contract. Otherwise, although it was the aim of the suit and the effect of the judgment to give vitality and operation to the subsequent law, and this court might be of the opinion that there was a valid contract which thereby would be impaired, it would be powerless to enforce the constitutional guaranty.

And, in determining whether effect has been given to the later statute, this court is not limited to the mere consideration of the language of the opinion of the state court. McCullough v.

L. ed. 1001, 1006, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 627. In the present case, it is apparent that the whole object of the suit was to establish the right of the city to carry out the subsequent ordinance, which conflicted with and repealed the earlier ordinance so far as it might be construed to give to the plaintiff in error the particular privileges therein described. It was, as appears from the petition itself, to accomplish the purpose of the later enactment, and the building of the belt line thereunder, that the city asked the aid of the court's injunction in this suit; and it was through this protection that the municipal scheme of construction under the later ordinance was actually carried out. The final judgment completed and made permanent this protection, with respect to operation as well as construction, as against the claim of contract right. It must follow that this court has jurisdiction to determine whether that claim is well-founded; that is, whether there is a contractual obligation which the plaintiff in error is entitled to enforce without its being impaired by the operation of the subsequent provision having, by virtue of state authority, the force of state law.\n It is the contention of the plaintiff in error that, although the proposed belt road to Henderson street was not built by the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company, and although it be assumed that the failure of that company to build was legally excusable, and hence, that the obligation of the plaintiff in error to build in its stead did not arise, still there was an effective grant under ordinance No. 1997, and the plaintiff in error is entitled to \n\n[235 U.S. 164, 172]\n\u00a0\n the use of the belt in the manner therein described upon the payment of $ 50,000.\n We agree with the state court that this is not a proper interpretation of the ordinance. \n1\n Provision had already \n\n[235 U.S. 164, 173]\n\u00a0\n been made for construction to the designated point by the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company. Ordinance No. 1997 prefaced its grant by a recital of the right of construction which had been given to that com- \n\n[235 U.S. 164, 174]\n\u00a0\n pany, and it was expressly stated that the grant to the plaintiff in error was made 'under the belt provisions of said ordinance No. 1615.' It had been provided in the last-mentioned ordinance that the public authorities might give to other railroad companies the right to use the road thus to be constructed, on their making contributions which should go into a special fund for the further extension of the belt line system. It is manifest that the intent was to give to the plaintiff in error the described right to use the tracks thus to be laid. But it was also contem- \n\n[235 U.S. 164, 175]\n\u00a0\n plated that the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company might fail to build, and that this failure might be 'without legal excuse.' In that event, it was agreed that the plaintiff in error should step into the place of the other company and assume the burden of construction 'under the terms and conditions' of ordinance No. 1615, such construction to take the place of the pecuniary consideration for the use of the tracks. It was further apparent that the fulfilment of the plan of ordinance No. 1615 might be legally impossible, and hence that the failure of the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company might be legally excused. In this event, the plaintiff in error did not undertake to build, and no right of construction was given to it. We cannot imply such a right. While we are to give to public grants a fair and reasonable interpretation (United States v. Denver & R. G. R. Co. \n150 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 37 S. L. ed. 975, 979, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 11; Russell v. Sebastian, \n233 \nU.S. 195, 205\n, 58 S. L. ed. 912, 921, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 517, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 1282), they are not to be extended by implication beyond their clear intent. The right of construction was given to the plaintiff in error in a particular contingency, and not otherwise; and the explicit provision for construction negatives an intention to bind the city to permit it in a case not specified. There was abundant reason for both expression and omission. The suit of the dock board was pending, and whether the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company would be able to build, as provided in ordinance No. 1615, was undecided. If that company did build, the city was prepared to give, and, in that event, did give, to the plaintiff in error, the right of way upon the agreed payment; and if that company failed to build 'without legal excuse,' the city was ready to provide, and in that event did provide, that the plaintiff in error should build in its stead. But if there were legal excuse for a failure of the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company to build, it was plainly desirable that neither party should be bound. In that case, as the terms \n\n[235 U.S. 164, 176]\n\u00a0\n of the ordinance show, the plaintiff in error was unwilling to assume the burden of construction, and the city, by not binding itself in that contingency, preserved its freedom to deal as it might seem best with the exigency that would thus arise. Ordinance No. 1997 did not obligate the city to build the belt road or any part of it; it did not bind the city to cause the road to be built by others. As we read the ordinance, it was intended to confer rights exclusively with reference to an existing plan of construction, and if that plan proved abortive, because of legal obstacles to its fulfilment, no right was conferred upon the plaintiff in error.\n It is urged that the provisions of ordinance No. 1997 ( 3, par. (c) that the belt tracks to be constructed by the plaintiff in error, as soon as they were completed to Henderson street, should be turned over to the 'immediate ownership of the city,' and should be under the 'control and management' of the public belt authority, obviated the objection raised by the dock board with respect to ordinance No. 1615. But an examination of other provisions of the ordinance shows that this 'control and management' was intended to be subject to certain limitations. Thus, it was provided in paragraph (f) that all controversies between the plaintiff in error and the public belt authority, or any other company or companies to which the use of the tracks might be granted, relating to the movement and handling of cars, trains, and traffic thereon, should be submitted to three arbitrators, one to be selected by the plaintiff in error, the second by the public belt authority, or by such other company or companies, as the case might be, and the third by the two thus chosen, and that the decision of any two of these arbitrators was to have the effect of an 'amicable composition.' We find no reason to doubt the correctness of the conclusion that the conditions, subject to which the dock board approved the dedication for belt road purposes of \n\n[235 U.S. 164, 177]\n\u00a0\n the portion of the proposed route under its jurisdiction, would have been violated under the plan of ordinance No. 1997, as well as under that of ordinance No. 1615. And, further, it is clear that the proviso in paragraph (c) which related to tracks to be constructed by the plaintiff in error did not change the event in which alone the plaintiff in error was entitled to construct them, and this was in case the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company should fail to build 'without legal excuse.'\n Thus far we have assumed that the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company was legally excused from building. But it is insisted by the plaintiff in error that this is not the case. That is, it is said that the grant of the right to construct was divisible, and that, so far as the city was competent to provide for such construction, the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company was bound to build the belt road, and, therefore, that its failure to build to this extent was 'without legal excuse' within the meaning of the paragraph (c). But ordinance No. 1615 negatives this view. It explicitly provided for construction 'from the end of the rails on the upper side of Audubon park to Henderson street,' and that the city should furnish 'a clear legal right of way for the construction of said tracks.' We think that there is no basis whatever for the contention that the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company was bound to construct a part of the belt road specified if, by reason of the successful opposition of the dock board, it was without power to build the remainder. And when the dock board prevailed in its suit, that company was entitled to abandon, as it did abandon, the undertaking. This was the event which was carefully excluded by ordinance No. 1997 in defining the contingency in which the plaintiff in error should build. The provision in paragraph (c) for the return of the securities which were to be deposited by the plaintiff in error as security for the performance of its obligation, in case \n\n[235 U.S. 164, 178]\n\u00a0\n it should be prevented 'from building said belt tracks or any portion of the same on account of the city not furnishing the right of way,' or 'by causes beyond its control,' tends to support, rather than to oppose, the view that the undertaking was regarded as an entirety; for all the securities were to be returned although the prevention related to a portion of the route only. We are also referred to the provision ( 3, par . (d) that, in the event that the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company should, from any cause, complete 'only a portion of the tracks' described, the plaintiff in error should have the right 'to operate its own locomotives, cars,' etc, 'over such portion of the tracks' as had already been built, and as might be built by the first-mentioned company, for a proportionate part of the agreed payment. This clause, in view of the existing situation of the parties, was held by the state court to have reference to a contingency in which, the opposition of the dock board not having been successful, the railroad company had proceeded with its undertaking, and, having built a part of the tracks, had failed to complete them; and this construction is in harmony with the other provisions of the ordinance. But, in fact, the event described in paragraph (d) did not happen, as no part of the road was built; and this clause in no way aids the contention that the New Orleans & San Francisco Railroad Company was under legal obligation to undertake a partial construction if it became legally impossible to carry out its undertaking as a whole.\n We conclude that the contract upon which the plaintiff in error relies was subject, in any aspect, to a supensive condition (Civil Code [ La.] art. 2021), that the event in which the obligation was to arise did not happen, and hence, that the subsequent enactment was not open to the objection raised.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'This ordinance, so far as it is material with respect to this question, is as follows:\n'Section 3.

CO. v. HIGDON(1914)\nNo. 322\nArgued: Decided: June 22, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. Benjamin D. Warfield, Henry Lane Stone, Charles H. Moorman, Edward S. Jouett, Malcolm Yeaman, and William A. Colston for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[234 U.S. 592, 594]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James W. Clay, J. F. Clay, and A. Y. Clay for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The defendant in error, Joe Higdon, doing business under the name of the Crescent Coal Company, brought suit in the Henderson circuit court, of Kentucky, to recover damages for alleged loss because of the failure of the railroad company to furnish him with cars at the Keystone Mining & Manufacturing Company's mine at Henderson, Kentucky, with which to perform certain contracts which he had made, and which he was prevented \n\n[234 U.S. 592, 595]\n\u00a0\n from fulfilling by the refusal of the railroad company. While the action was originally brought at law, it was transferred upon motion of the plaintiff in error to the equity docket. The decree of the circuit court dismissing the petition was reversed in the court of appeals for Kentucky, and the case was remanded for a new trial in conformity to the opinion of that court (143 Ky. 73, 33 L.R.A.(N.S.) 442, 135 S. W. 768. The case was again tried and a decree for Higdon for damages was affirmed by the court of appeals (149 Ky. 321, 148 S. W. 26), and the case was brought here on writ of error. A motion to dismiss the writ for want of jurisdiction was, on December 16, 1912, postponed to the hearing upon the merits.\n From the facts found and apparent in the record it appears: Higdon, doing business as the Crescent Coal Company, was engaged in buying and selling coal in the city of Henderson, and the railroad company was a common carrier having its main line running in and through that city. It had a belt line and various spurs and tracks leading from its main and belt lines into industrial plants in Henderson. The Keystone Company was operating a coal mine in Henderson, which was connected with the main and belt lines of the plaintiff in error's road by a spur which the latter operated and controlled. Higdon contracted with the Keystone Company for 20,000 tons of coal to be delivered to him on the spur track, and afterwards contracted with various plants having spur connections to deliver coal in carload lots at certain prices. Thereafter he applied to the railroad company to furnish him cars at the Keystone Company's mine, and to transport coal in them to other spurs at Henderson, offering to pay therefor $4 per car, or at the rate of about 10 cents a ton, which he contended was according to the published rates of the railroad company. It refused to furnish him cars except at the rate of 50 cents a ton, which Higdon declined, and \n\n[234 U.S. 592, 596]\n\u00a0\n afterwards the railroad company informed him that it would not furnish cars at any price. This action was brought with the result which we have stated.\n No Federal question was raised in the first trial or upon the first appeal to the Kentucky court of appeals. The alleged Federal questions are said to arise because of two amended answers which the plaintiff in error tendered, and which the circuit court refused to permit it to file. In its first amended answer the plaintiff in error alleged that it had built side tracks and spurs from its main track to certain industries in Henderson for the delivery and receipt of freight to and from points beyond that city; that it had constructed such a spur to the mine of the Keystone Company, with the express understanding that the plaintiff in error would not transport coal for the Keystone Company of for anyone else between that spur and other spurs at Henderson, but that it should be used solely for traffic coming into and going out of Henderson; that it was not engaged and did not propose to engage in the business of transportation as a common carrier between industries at Henderson or any other station, or in transporting coal from the Keystone Company's mine to spur tracks at Henderson, and that while it performed a switching service, it did so only when it preceded or followed transportation beyond Henderson. It further alleged that the service requested by Higdon was a transportation service which the railroad company declined to perform because it did not profess to and did not engage in that business, and that it was not its duty as a common carrier so to do or to furnish cars for such purpose. It also alleged that its tariffs did not fix a rate for the movement of coal from the mine of the Keystone Company to the spurs at Henderson, and that it did not offer by such tariffs to perform such service; and that there was no other demand for such service, and no other coal mine at Henderson. And it alleged that it was not its duty to \n\n[234 U.S. 592, 597]\n\u00a0\n perform such service for $4 per car or for any other sum, but that a rate of 50 cents a ton, which was the legal rate in effect for hauling coal from points near Henderson to that city and which was reasonable, would have been a reasonable charge for the service requested by Higdon, and that a smaller rate would not have been adequate compensation therefor; and concluded that to compel the railroad company to perform the service asked by Higdon at $4 per car or for a rate less than 50 cents a ton would be to compel it to perform a service which, under the law, it was not its duty to perform, and at less than cost thereof, and for less than the service was worth, with the result of depriving the railroad company of its property without due process of law, and denying it the equal protection of the law, contrary to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n In its second amended answer it set up, besides certain of the allegations in the first amended answer to the effect that it was not its duty to move freight between private spurs, that its facilities at Henderson for delivering and receiving freight were amply sufficient to accommodate the public; that it was engaged in interstate commerce, and that to require the defendant to perform the service asked by Higdon would impose upon it the duty of performing like services at other points on its line in Kentucky, and would impose upon it unreasonable, unjustifiable, and unwarrantable duties which it as a common carrier was not required to perform, and would be a direct and unreasonable and unwarrantable interference with its interstate business and its duties as a carrier of interstate commerce, and would impose an unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce, contrary to  8 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States.\n Had the court of appeals put its decision upon the ground that the duty of the circuit court was simply to \n\n[234 U.S. 592, 598]\n\u00a0\n give effect to the judgment of the court of appeals by enforcing the rights of the parties upon the principles settled by it in its first decision, and that the attempt to inject Federal questions into the record by amended pleadings after the case was remanded did not seasonably raise Federal questions reviewable by the court of appeals, the case would be ruled by Union Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Kirchoff, \n169 U.S. 103\n, 42 L. ed. 677, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 260, in which this court held that such attempts to raise Federal questions came too late to lay the foundation for review here. See also Yazoo & M. Valley R. Co. v. Adams, \n180 U.S. 1\n, 45 L. ed. 395, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240; Bonner v. Gorman, \n213 U.S. 86\n, 53 L. ed. 709, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 483.\n The court of appeals of Kentucky in the opinion delivered in the second case did affirm the principle of the binding character of its first decision, but as it gave consideration to the offered amended answers in their Federal aspect, and ruled concerning them, we have concluded not to sustain the motion to dismiss, but to regard the Federal questions as so far passed upon by the court of appeals as to present a case reviewable here. Miedreich v. Lauenstein, \n232 \nU.S. 236, 243\n, 58 S. L. ed. Sup. Ct. Rep. 309.\n Looking to the opinion of the court of appeals in the second case, as we may properly do, to determine the nature of its ruling concerning the offered amended answers, we find that it held that the first part of the first amended answer was simply an elaboration of the defense presented by the second paragraph of the original answer, and that on the former appeal it had held that those facts did not present a defense to the action, and that the former opinion was the law of the case, and further consideration of that matter was unnecessary. Coming, then, to consider the conclusion of the averment of the first amended answer that a rate of $4 per car would be below the cost of the service, and therefore confiscatory, it did not pass upon the effect of that charge if required of the railroad company against its will, but held that its rates as fixed \n\n[234 U.S. 592, 599]\n\u00a0\n by its own tariffs, interpreted by its conduct, as held in the first opinion of the court of appeals, had made that rate applicable to the shipments requested by Higdon, and that therefore the requirement of performing the service at $4 per car was not imposed upon the plaintiff in error except because of its own tariff rate, which it might itself change at any time, but which, while it was in force, should affect all shippers alike, including Higdon. A reference to the former opinion of the court shows that the question whether the published tariffs of the railroad company applied to such service as Higdon required was elaborately considered, and it was held that it did so apply, and that as the railroad company was performing that service for other shippers similarly situated, to avoid discrimination, which the Constitution and laws of Kentucky inhibited, it was required to give the same rate to Higdon. It therefore results that in the so-called denial of the Federal right set up in the first amended answer the court in effect held that the facts upon which it was based had been concluded by the former decision, which was the law of the case, and to permit the railroad company to relitigate these facts because the result reached was alleged to violate constitutional provisions would permit it to relitigate that which the court held had been settled against it by the first decision of the court of appeals, in which no infraction of Federal right was duly set up as required to lay the foundation for review.\n As to the matter set up in the second amended answer, the court held that it made no defense within the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, because all the court had done was to make a decision which required the carrier to obey the state Constitution and laws which prevented discrimination as to purely intrastate shipments. We think the court was right in this conclusion. The state had full authority over shipments purely intrastate, and the facts set up in the \n\n[234 U.S. 592, 600]\n\u00a0\n second amended answer, that the requirement made at Henderson might be made at other points in the state, and would result in an unnecessary and unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce, only avers an indirect effect upon such commerce of the exercise of a right clearly within the authority of the state; and being only of that indirect and consequential character, it does not deprive the railroad company of rights secured by the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States.\n We conclude that the rulings made in the Court of Appeals of Kentucky concerning the first and second amended answers which were not permitted to be filed in the court of original jurisdiction did not deprive the railroad company of rights secured by the Federal Constitution.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","122":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUISVILLE & N R.

According to the allegations of the bill, when given the effect that must be given to them for present purposes, the case is this: The appellant has a feesimple title to the land constituting the right of way, and is in possession, and the appellee is asserting a right to subject portions of the right of way to its use under the three judgments recently obtained. The appellant insists, for various reasons fully set forth, that the judgments were procured and rendered in such disregard of applicable local laws as to be clearly invalid, and that they operate to becloud its title. The matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $3,000, the right of way is within the district in which the bill was filed, and the appellant and appellee are, respectively, Kentucky and New York corporations. The prayer of the bill is, that the judgments be held null and void and the appellee enjoined from exercising or asserting any right under them. Appearing specially for the purpose, the appellee objected to the district court's jurisdiction, upon the ground that neither of the parties was a resident of that district, and that the suit was not one that could be brought in a district other than that of the residence of one of them without the appellee's consent. The court sustained the objection, dismissed the bill, and allowed this direct appeal under  238 of the Judicial Code. [36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 228.]\n We are only concerned with the jurisdiction of the district court as a Federal court; that is, with its power to entertain the suit under the laws of the United States. \n\n[234 U.S. 369, 372]\n\u00a0\n Fore River Shipbuilding Co. v.

Lowe, \n155 U.S. 58\n, 39 L. ed. 69, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 24; Ellenwood v. Marietta Chair Co. \n158 U.S. 105\n, 39 L. ed. 913, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 771; Kentucky Coal Lands Co v. Mineral Development Co. 191 Fed. 899, 915), it is clear that the district court in which the suit was brought cannot entertain it, unless one of the six succeeding sections provides otherwise, or the appellee waives its personal privilege of being sued only in the district of its or the appellant's residence.

Co. \n210 U.S. 368\n, 52 L. ed. 1101, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 720.\n The appellant relies upon  57, one of the six succeeding sections, as adequately sustaining the jurisdiction. This section reads as follows:\n'When in any suit commenced in any district court of the United States to enforce any legal or equitable lien upon or claim to, or to remove any encumbrance or lien or cloud upon the title to real or personal property within the district where such suit is brought, one or more of the defendants therein shall not be an inhabitant of or found within the said district, or shall not voluntarily appear thereto, it shall be lawful for the court to make an order directing such absent defendant or defendants to appear, plead, answer, or demur by a day certain to be designated, which order shall be served on such absent defendant or defendants, if practicable, wherever found, and also upon the person or persons in possession or charge of said property, if any there be; or where such personal service upon such absent defendant or defendants is not practicable, such order shall be published in such manner as the court may direct, not less than once a week for six consecutive weeks. In case such absent defendants shall not appear, plead, answer, or demur within the time so limited, or within some further time, to be allowed by the court, in its discretion, and upon proof of the service or publication of said order and of the performance of the directions contained in the same, it shall be lawful for the court to entertain jurisdiction, and proceed to the hearing and adjudication of such suit in the same manner as if such absent defendant had been served with process within the said district; but said adjudication shall, as regards said absent defendant or defendants without appearance, affect only the property which shall have been the subject of the suit and under the jurisdiction of the court therein, within such district; and when a part of the said real or personal prop- \n\n[234 U.S. 369, 374]\n\u00a0\n erty against which such proceedings shall be taken shall be within another district, but within the same state, such suit may be brought in either district in said state: Provided, however, That any defendant or defendants not actually personally notified as above provided may, at any time within one year after final judgment in any suit mentioned in this section, enter his appearance in said suit in said district court, and thereupon the said court shall make an order setting aside the judgment therein and permitting said defendant or defendants to plead therein on payment by him or them of such costs as the court shall deem just; and thereupon said suit shall be proceeded with to final judgment according to law.'\n\n It will be perceived that this section not only plainly contemplates that a suit 'to remove any encumbrance, lien, or cloud upon the title to real or personal property' shall be cognizable in the district court of the district wherein the property is located, but expressly provides for notifying the defendant by personal service outside the district, and, if that be impracticable, by publication. The section has been several times considered by this court, and, unless there be merit in an objection yet to be noticed, the decisions leave no doubt of its applicability to the present suit, even though both parties reside outside the district.

Co. \n177 U.S. 1\n, 44 L. ed. 647, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 559; Citizens' Sav. & T. Co. v. Illinois C. R. Co. \n205 U.S. 46\n, 51 L. ed. 703, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 425; Chase v. Wetzlar, \n225 U.S. 79\n, 56 L. ed. 990, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 659.\n The appellee, after asserting that each of the judgments is void upon its face if the attack upon it in the bill is well taken, calls attention to the general rule that a bill in equity does not lie to cancel, as a cloud upon title, a conveyance or instrument that is void upon its face, and then insists that  57 must be regarded as adopted in the light of that rule, and as not intended to displace it, or to embrace a suit brought in opposition to it. The difficulty \n\n[234 U.S. 369, 375]\n\u00a0\n with this contention is that it seeks to make the usages of courts of equity the sole test of what constitutes a cloud upon title, so as to bring a suit to remove it within the operation of  57, and disregards the bearing which the state law rightly has upon the question. As long ago as 1839 this court had occasion, in Clark v. Smith, 13 Pet. 195, 10 L. ed. 123, to consider whether a Federal court sitting in the state of Kentucky could entertain a suit to remove a cloud from the title to real property in that state where the right to such relief depended upon a remedial statute of the state; and in the opinion, which fully sustained the jurisdiction, the court pointed out that the nature of the right was such that it could only be enforced in a court of equity, and then said (p. 203 ): 'Kentucky has the undoubted power to regulate and protect individual rights to her soil, and to declare what shall form a cloud on titles; and having so declared, the courts of the United States, by removing such clouds, are only applying an old practice to a new equity created by the legislature. . . . The state legislatures certainly have no authority to prescribe the forms and modes of proceeding in the courts of the United States; but having created a right, and at the same time prescribed the remedy to enforce it, if the remedy prescribed is substantially consistent with the ordinary modes of proceeding on the chancery side of the Federal courts, no reason exists why it should not be pursued in the same form as it is in the state courts; on the contrary, propriety and convenience suggest that the practice should not materially differ, where titles to lands are the subjects of investigation. And such is the constant course of the Federal courts.' The principle of that decision has been reaffirmed and applied in many cases, one being Reynolds v. First Nat. Bank, \n112 U.S. 405\n, 28 L. ed. 733, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 213. It was a suit in the circuit court for the district of Indiana to remove a cloud from title in virtue of a statute of that state, and the objection was interposed that the deed sought to be \n\n[234 U.S. 369, 376]\n\u00a0\n canceled was void upon its face, and therefore afforded no basis for such a suit in a Federal court. But this court pronounced the objection untenable, saying (p. 410): 'While, therefore, the courts of equity may have generally adopted the rule that a deed, void upon its face, does not cast a cloud upon the title which a court of equity would undertake to remove, we may yet look to the legislation of the state in which the court sits to ascertain what constitutes a cloud upon the title, and what the state laws declare to be such, the courts of the United States, sitting in equity, have jurisdiction to remove.' Citing Clark v. Smith, supra. See also Cowley v. Northern P. R. Co. \n159 \nU.S. 569, 582\n, 40 S. L. ed. 263, 266, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 127. There are many state statutes of this type, and our decisions show that their enforcement in the Federal courts is subject to but three restrictions: 1. The case must be within the general class over which those courts are given jurisdiction. 2. A suit in equity does not lie in those courts where there is a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law. 3. In those courts there can be no commingling of legal and equitable remedies, or substitution of the latter for the former, whereby the constitutional right of trial by jury in actions at law is defeated. Judicial Code,  24 (cl. 1) and 267; Whitehead v. Shattuck, \n138 \nU.S. 146, 152\n, 156 S., 34 L. ed. 873, 874, 876, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 276; Greeley v. Lowe, \n155 \nU.S. 58, 75\n, 39 S.

L. ed. 65, 73, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 15.\n We conclude that the provision in  57 of the Judicial Code, respecting suits to remove clouds from title, was intended to embrace, and does embrace, suits of that nature when founded upon the remedial statutes of the several states, as well as when resting upon established usages and practice in equity.\n The state of Mississippi has such a statute. Code of 1906,  550. Although originally more restricted (Hutchinson's Code, p. 773; Rev. Code 1857, p. 541, art. 8), it has read as follows since 1871 (Rev. Code 1871,  975): \n\n[234 U.S. 369, 377]\n\u00a0\n 'When a person, not the rightful owner of any real estate, shall have any conveyance or other evidence of title thereto, or shall assert any claim, or pretend to have any right or title thereto, which may cast doubt or suspicion on the title of the real owner, such real owner may file a bill in the chancery court to have such conveyance or other evidence or claim of title canceled, and such cloud, doubt, or suspicion removed from said title, whether such real owner be in possession or not, or be threatened to be disturbed in his possession or not, and whether the defendant be a resident of this state or not.'\n While we have not been referred to any decision of the supreme court of the state passing directly upon the question whether a conveyance or other evidence of title void upon its face is within the purview of this statute, the decisions of that court brought to our attention show that it has treated the statute as embracing conveyances described as 'void,' whether the invalidity was shown upon the face of the instrument being left uncertain (Eztelle v. Parker, 41 Miss. 520; Wofford v. Bailey, 57 Miss. 239; Drysdale v. Biloxi Canning Co. 67 Miss. 534, 7 So. 541; Preston v. Banks, 71 Miss. 601, 14 So. 258; Wildberger v. Puckett, 78 Miss. 650, 29 So. 393); and also that it regards the statute as very comprehensive and materially enlarging existing equitable remedies. In Huntington v. Allen, 44 Miss. 654, 662, it was said: 'The statute in reference to the removal of clouds from title enlarges the principle upon which courts of equity were accustomed to administer relief. It is very broad, allowing the real owner in all cases to apply for the cancelation of a deed or other evidence of title which casts a cloud or suspicion on his title . . . . The terms used in the statute, expressive of the scope of the jurisdiction, viz., 'cloud,' 'doubt,' 'suspicion,' quite distinctly imply that the instrument which creates them is apparent rather than 'real'; is 'semblance' rather than substance; obscures rather than \n\n[234 U.S. 369, 378]\n\u00a0\n destroys or defeats.' In Cook v. Friley, 61 Miss. 1, 4, it was further said: 'The statute . . . not only authorizes the real owner to file his bill to cancel a paper title, but also to remove the cloud, doubt, or suspicion which may spring from the assertion of claim, or pretense of right or title thereto by the defendant, who, without any muniment of title, may assert a claim or pretend to have right or title. The purpose was to give the real owner a remedy against one who asserts any claim or pretends to have any right or title to such owner's land, in analogy to the right of action by the canon law for jactitation of marriage. The real owner is entitled to protection against jactitation of title to the disparagement of his real ownership. He may bring into court one who asserts any claim or pretends to have any right or title to his land, and require him to vindicate his claim, or submit to its extinguishment by decree of the court.' And in People's Bank v. West, 67 Miss. 729, 740, 8 L. R.A. 727, 7 So. 513, the court concluded its opinion with the statement: 'We know of no line by which the jurisdiction of the court is limited other than that prescribed by the law which confers it. When the complainant shows a perfect title, legal or equitable, and the title of the defendant is shown to be invalid, it is, in the nature of things, a cloud upon the title of complainant, and should be canceled.'\n In view of these decisions, we think the statute must be regarded as entitling the rightful owner of real property in the state to maintain a suit to dispel a cloud cast upon his title by an invalid deed or other instrument, even though it be one which, when tested by applicable legal principles, is void upon its face.\n The judgments sought to be canceled as clouds upon the appellant's title were rendered by special courts of eminent domain, each composed of a justice of the peace and a jury. According to the statute controlling such proceedings (Miss. Code 1906, chap. 43) the special court is not \n\n[234 U.S. 369, 379]\n\u00a0\n permitted to quash or dismiss the proceeding for want of jurisdiction or for any other reason, or to inquire whether the applicant has a right to condemn, or whether the contemplated use is public, but 'must proceed with the condemnation' ( 1862, 1865, 1866); and, while an appeal lies to the circuit court, a supersedeas is not permitted, and upon the appeal the circuit court is restricted, like the special court, to an ascertainment of the compensation to be paid to the owner ( 1871). A form of judgment is prescribed, which contains blanks for a description of the property and a recital of the compensation awarded, and then declares: 'Now, upon payment of the said award, applicant can enter upon and take possession of the said property, and appropriate it to public use, as prayed for in the application' ( 1867). An affirmative provision to the same effect also appears in the statute ( 1868). Considering these statutory provisions and  17 of the state Constitution, which declares that the question whether the condemnation is for a public use shall be a judicial question, the supreme court of the state holds that 'the only question which can be raised in the eminent domain court, and the only jurisdiction confided to it, is the jurisdiction to ascertain the amount of damage sustained by the party whose lands are sought to be taken;' that 'a new issue, involving a new question and new pleadings, cannot be raised in the appellate tribunal, that is to say, in the circuit court;' that the owner 'may litigate the right to take his property at any time before acceptance of the compensation, or before the waiver of his right to have the question of the use judicially determined;' that 'neither the Constitution nor the laws of the state provide any particular tribunal in which this question shall be determined, nor is it a matter of any particular concern in what court the question shall be settled, provided it be determined in that form which is capable of deciding it,' and that the \n\n[234 U.S. 369, 380]\n\u00a0\n appropriate mode of litigating the question is by a suit in equity challenging the right of the condemnor to enter under the judgment of the court of eminent domain. Vinegar Bend Lumber Co. v. Oak Grove & G. R. Co. 89 Miss. 84, 43 So. 292. Thus it will be perceived that under the law of the state, as declared by its court of last resort, the judgment of a special court of eminent domain may be challenged by a bill in equity upon the ground that the condemnation is not for a public purpose. This being so, and the elements of Federal jurisdiction being present, the litigation may, of course, be had in a Federal court. One of the grounds upon which the judgments are challenged in the present bill is that the condemnation is not for a public purpose. If this ground be well taken, as to which we intimate no opinion, the judgments apparently confer upon the appellee a right in the appellant's right of way to which the appellee is not entitled.\n We conclude that the suit is one to remove a cloud from title within the meaning of  57 of the Judicial Code, and is cognizable in the court below, although neither of the parties resides in that district.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","123":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUSVILLE & N R. CO. v. WOODFORD(1914)\nNo. 531\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles H. Moorman, Benjamin D. Warfield, Henry Lane Stone, and Robert A. Thornton for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Robert B. Franklin and Robert C. Talbott for defendants in error.\n\n\n[234 U.S. 46, 48]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n Catesby Woodford and John T. Ireland, defendants in error, plaintiffs below, brought suit in the Fayette circuit court, of Kentucky, against the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company, plaintiff in error, defendant below, to recover damages for the loss of a number of race horses and injury to others shipped by them on November 17, 1910, over the lines of the defendant from Lexington, Kentucky, to Juarez, Mexico. There was a verdict for the plaintiffs in the trial court, judgment upon which was affirmed by the court of appeals of Kentucky (152 Ky. 398, 153 S. W. 722), and the case is here upon writ of error.\n The amended petition contained an allegation that the defendant agreed by contract entered into in Fayette county, Kentucky, to transport the horses from Lexington to Juarez, and set forth the cause and extent of the loss to plaintiffs. The defendant answered, traversing the allegations of the petition, and pleading contributory negligence, and the plaintiffs filed their reply. The defendant by motion sought to have the contract sued upon, which it alleged was in writing, filed as an exhibit to the petition, and subsequently the plaintiffs filed the contract of shipment, and the same was noted of record. It provided, among other things, that, in consideration of the reduced rate, the extent of the damages for which the defendant would be liable should not exceed $150 for a stallion or jack, and $100 for a horse or mule, the agreed value of the animals, and across the face of the contract were stamped the following words: 'The attention of the shippers has been called to the terms, conditions, value, etc., herein named.' It also appears that the contract of shipment was produced and filed in evidence by the plaintiffs.\n One of the instructions requested by the defendant was to the effect that, if the jury found for the plaintiffs, they \n\n[234 U.S. 46, 49]\n\u00a0\n should fix the damages at the fair market value of the horses killed, and the difference in value before and after the injury of the other horses. After verdict and judgment for plaintiffs, the defendant filed its motion and grounds, and additional grounds, for a new trial, none of which, however, were based upon the provisions of the contract of shipment or any act of Congress. The court, in overruling the motion, said, however, that it had also heard counsel 'upon the Federal question raised by the defendant as to whether the contract in question for the transportation of said colts and fillies mentioned in the petition from Lexington, Kentucky, to Juarez, in the Republic of Mexico, was in violation of the provisions, or any of them, of an act of Congress of the United States entitled, 'An Act to Regulate Commerce,' approved February 4, 1887 [24 Stat. at L. 379, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3154],' as amended, 'and having considered the said motion and grounds for a new trial of this cause, and having also considered the said Federal question, and being of the opinion that said contract did not and does not violate any of the provisions of said act of Congress, the motion is hereby overruled and a new trial is refused.'\n The case was taken by appeal to the court of appeals of Kentucky. After submission of the case to that court, the defendant filed a supplemental brief, urging the application of the law of the case of Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 57 L. ed. 314, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148, and further insisted upon such application in its brief in reply to the plaintiffs' reply brief. The court of appeals noticed that the claim that the law of the Croninger Case controlled was first suggested by defendant in its supplemental brief, after submission of the case to that court, and that the case had been tried under the rule of law in Kentucky that a contract relieving a carrier from its common-law liability, and limiting recovery to less than the value of the property carried, is in violation of the Kentucky Constitution, and held that it was elementary that questions not raised in the trial court in an ap- \n\n[234 U.S. 46, 50]\n\u00a0\n propriate way, which, by the Code of Practice of Kentucky, is in writing, would not be considered on appeal; and, after detailing the proceedings in the trial court, concluded that no Federal question had thus been made. The defendant, by petition for rehearing, again insisted that the Federal question had been properly presented, but the court of appeals, admitting that state courts must take judicial notice of acts of Congress, and that it was not essential that the Federal question should have been raised in any special form in the trial court, held that the facts on which such question rested must be presented in the record; that the provisions of the written contract, upon which the defendant then relied, not having been pleaded, no Federal question was presented; and moreover, that the defendant had asked for an instruction inconsistent with the view then presented, and conducted its case throughout the trial on that basis (153 Ky. 185, 154 S. W. 1083).\n That the defendant was entitled to make a defense under the act to regulate commerce, as amended (34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1288), is evidently an afterthought. The case was tried upon the theory that the Kentucky Constitution and statutes were controlling, and it was not until after the decision of Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, supra, that an attempt was made to claim the benefit of the bill of lading based upon schedules filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. It is true that a written bill of lading showing a limitation of $100 in value for each horse was filed in the case by the plaintiff below after the motion of the defendant had been filed, as the amended record discloses, but in order to assert this defense it was necessary not only to have the contract filed, but that the defendant below should set up the facts showing that such defense was available to it. No pleading was filed by the defendant alleging compliance with the act to regulate commerce by the filing of schedules containing the limitation as to the liability upon which \n\n[234 U.S. 46, 51]\n\u00a0\n reliance is now placed. As we have already said, the record discloses that, at the trial, the defendant, instead of relying upon the limited liability now claimed, entirely ignoring such limitation, itself asked and obtained an instruction that if the jury should find for the plaintiff, it should fix the damages in such sum as would represent the loss suffered. Of course, the request to give this instruction was entirely inconsistent with the claim of limited liability under the Federal statute.\n If a Federal question can be said to be involved at all, it was introduced into the record upon the argument of the motion for a new trial. Disposing of that question, the court of appeals of Kentucky set forth that the question was not raised by the pleadings or requested instructions, or by motion for a new trial, or written motion of any kind, and concluded that it must have been raised orally. It pointed out that under the Kentucky Code of Practice such contentions were required to be in writing, and that if the defendant desired to take advantage of its limited liability, it must, under the Code of the state, specifically rely upon that defense in its answer. In making this holding, the Kentucky court but enforced a rule of practice of that state. The decisions of this court not only have repeatedly held that a Federal right, in order to be reviewable here, must be set up and denied in the state court, but have often held that such claim of denial is not properly brought to the attention of this court where it appears that the state court declined to pass upon the question because it was not raised in the trial court, as required by the state practice. Schuyler Nat. Bank v. Bollong, \n150 U.S. 85\n, 37 L. ed. 1008, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 24; Erie R. Co. v. Purdy, \n185 U.S. 148\n, 46 L. ed. 847, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 605; Layton v. Missouri, \n187 U.S. 356\n, 47 L. ed. 214, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 137. In this case there is no reason to believe that there was an attempt on the part of the state court to evade the decision of Federal questions, duly set up, by unwarranted resort to alleged rules under local practice, and upon this \n\n[234 U.S. 46, 52]\n\u00a0\n point this case comes within former rulings of this court, as we have seen.\n As to the contention that the case really raised a Federal question because it involved the constitutional validity of a state statute when opposed to the exclusive rights secured under a Federal law,-an examination of the record shows that no such question was made in the state court, nor was it necessarily involved in the decision made, in such sense as to make the case reviewable here on that ground.\n It follows that the case must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOVELL-MCCONNELL MFG CO. v.

Massie and Ralph Lane Scott for respondent.[ Lovell-McConnell Mfg Co v. Automobile Supply Mfg Co \n235 U.S. 383\n (1914) ]\n\n\n[235 U.S. 383, 386]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The application is for leave to file a petition for mandamus directing the court below to correct the action taken by it which is complained of, or for the allowance of a certiorari to bring up the record in order that such complained-of action may be reviewed. We decline to allow leave to file the petition for mandamus, but grant the petition for certiorari, and, conformably to the stipulation of the parties, treat the document made a part of this proceeding as the record for the purpose of the certiorari, and proceed to act upon the same, treating the case as under submission on the merits.\n The Automobile Supply Company appealed to the court below from an interlocutory decree in favor of the complainant, the Lovell-McConnell Company, finding that the patents sued on had been infringed, and awarding an injunction, and directing an accounting for damages and profits. On such appeal the Automobile Supply Company furnished the clerk of the court below a complete printed record accompanied with a written index of the contents of the same, and, in consequence of a demand made by the clerk, deposited under protest the sum of $696 as a fee \n\n[235 U.S. 383, 387]\n\u00a0\n due the clerk for supervising the printed record so furnished. When, after a hearing, the court reversed the decree of the trial court, the Automobile Supply Company called upon the clerk either to refund the money charged for supervision, or to include it in his statement of the costs to be entered on the mandate. The clerk, being doubtful as to his duty in the matter, refused to do either, and insisted that the propriety of the charge be tested, to the end that he might act advisedly in the premises. The Automobile Supply Company thereupon moved to direct the clerk to include the supervision fee in the mandate, or to refund the amount of the deposit which had been made. The court held that the charge for supervision was lawful, and was therefore properly taxable as costs, and directed the clerk to retain the money and include a charge for the same in the mandate. The application before us was then made by the Lovell- McConnell Company, the party cast and ultimately bound for the costs, both the parties, however, entering into the agreement as to the record and the submission on the merits which we at the outset stated.\n Considering the act of Congress of February 13th, 1911 (36 Stat. at L. 901, chap. 47, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1656), in Rainey v. W. R. Grace & Co. \n231 U.S. 703\n, 58 L. ed. 445, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 242, it was held that the provisions of the act were applicable to the circuit courts of appeals, and it was consequently decided that where a printed transcript of the record was filed in compliance with the statute with the clerk of the court of appeals, no supervision fee could be charged by such clerk. Of course, if that ruling is here applicable, the court below clearly erred in allowing the charge for supervision, and the only possible question, therefore, is whether the statute, although generally applicable to records filed in the circuit court of appeals, is not so applicable in this case. It is insisted that it is not-and the court below so held- because, as the statute only provides for an appeal from a 'final judgment or decree,' it does not apply to \n\n[235 U.S. 383, 388]\n\u00a0\n a case like the one under consideration, where the appeal was from a decree interlocutory in character. But without affixing to the statute a latitudinarian meaning, upon the theory that to do so is essential to give effect to its purpose and intent, and bring every interlocutory decree within its reach, we are of opinion that to exclude an interlocutory decree of the character of the one here involved from the operation of the statute would be to frustrate its plain purpose by a too rigid and unreasoning adherence to its letter. We so conclude because, while in a technical sense the decree here in question was interlocutory, when its character and the scope of the subject-matter which the appeal brought under review and the relief under it which it was competent to afford are considered, we are of opinion it must follow that such decree was, within the intendment of this statute, a final decree, and therefore that error was committed in permitting the supervision charge. Indeed, this view was taken in a well considered opinion by the circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit in a case decided before the ruling in the Rainey Case, supra (Smith v. Farbenfabriken of Elberfeld Co. 117 C. C. A. 133, 197 Fed. 894), and we approve the reasoning by which the ruling in that case was sustained.\n It results that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in its order approving the charging and retaining the fee for supervision, and such order is therefore reversed, with directions to the court below to take such steps as may be necessary by recalling the mandate, if needs be, or otherwise, to afford the relief essential to give effect to the conclusions which we have expressed.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","125":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMAGRUDER v. DRURY(1914)\nNo. 17\nArgued: October 27, 1914Decided: November 30, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 106, 107]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Nathaniel Wilson for appellants.\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 106, 108]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. J. Darlington for appellees.\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 106, 110]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n William A. Richardson, for some years before his death chief justice of the court of claims of the United States, died at Washington, District of Columbia, October 19th, 1896. By his last will and testament, dated August 9, 1895, he described himself as 'chief justice of the court of claims at Washington, a citizen and inhabitant of Cambridge, in the county of Middlesex and commonwealth of Massachusetts, and having property in said county.' By his will he appointed his brother George F. Richardson, of Lowell, Massachusetts, and Samuel A. Drury, of Washington, District of Columbia, as executors and trustees. The will was probated in the probate court of Middlesex county, Massachusetts, on the 28th day of October, 1896. It appears in the record that the deceased had a little real estate in Massachusetts, but the main portion of his estate was, and always had been, in the city of Washington. The probate of the will in Massachusetts seems to have been in deference to the expression in the will as to his place of residence. Subsequently, and upon certain proceedings being instituted to enforce taxation in Massachusetts of the estate in the hands of the executors, the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts held that the actual residence of Mr. Richardson could be inquired into in that proceeding, and upon the facts shown it was in the District of Columbia. Dallinger v. Richardson, 176 Mass. 77, 57 N. E. 224. That case grew out of the imposition of personal taxes amounting to $7,500 annually on the assets of the estate. As this would have nearly exhausted the income of the \n\n[235 U.S. 106, 111]\n\u00a0\n estate and cut off the support of the beneficiaries under the will, a bill for injunction was filed in this case in the supreme court of the District by the father in behalf of the present appellants, who were the beneficiaries under the will. An amended bill was subsequently filed, having for its object an injunction against the executors from paying out of the estate any taxes in the state of Massachusetts, it being stated that, notwithstanding the recitals of the will, William A. Richardson's place of residence and last domicil was in the District of Columbia, where the assets and personal securities of the estate were in the keeping of Samuel A. Drury, also a resident of the District of Columbia. In addition to the injunction, the bill prayed an account of the property of the estate which had come into the hands of the executors under the will, and that they might be required to file an account from time to time. Mr. George F. Richardson, one of the executors, being a resident of the state of Massachusetts, and declining to submit to the local jurisdiction, the amended bill was filed against Samuel A. Drury alone. The answer of Drury stated that he had the custody and control of the assets and personal securities, and expressed his willingness to account in the court or in any other jurisdiction in that behalf for the moneys received by him as executor and trustee. Such proceedings were had that, on April 1, 1899, a decree was made continuing the restraining order theretofore made in the case, and finding that the late William A. Richardson was last domiciled in the District of Columbia, where the beneficiaries lived, and it was ordered and decreed that Samuel A. Drury and Samuel Maddox, both of the District of Columbia, be appointed trustees to perform the trusts created in the will, and they were 'authorized and empowered to receive from the executors named in said will all the property whereof the deceased died seised and possessed, provided, nevertheless, that the said Samuel A. Drury and Samuel Maddox shall first give \n\n[235 U.S. 106, 112]\n\u00a0\n separate bonds in the penal sum of $25,000 each, with one or more securities to be approved by this court, conditioned for the faithful discharge of their duties as such trustees.' Some five reports were made by the auditor to whom the matter was referred to take accounts, and various proceedings were had, which are fully set out in the opinion of the court of appeals in this case (37 App. D. C. 519). It is enough for our purposes to state that the proceedings resulted in an order of reference to the auditor to state the account of the trustees. This order was made on January 17, 1909. The auditor named having died, a further order of reference was made to another auditor to 'state the final account of the trustees and the distribution of the trust estate in their hands, and report such commission or compensation to the trustees as may be appropriate and proper.' To this report certain exceptions were filed by the present appellants. Upon final hearing, a decree was entered by which these exceptions were overruled, and the court of appeals sustained this action of the supreme court (37 App. D. C. supra). Hence this appeal.\n The argument has taken a wide range, and questions are discussed which are not embraced in the exceptions filed to the auditor's report which was the basis of action in the courts below, and in the court of appeals that court dealt with only three exceptions, stating that a number of exceptions were entered to the report, and that those relied upon in that court related to the allowance of a 5 per cent commission on principal and 10 per cent on income; to the $18,800 item allowed by the Massachusetts court; and to alleged profits made by the trustees in the purchase of notes for reinvestment.\n Under the statute in force at the time of this appeal, owing to the amount involved, the decision of the court of appeals might be brought by appeal in review before this court. This court therefore sits as an appellate court \n\n[235 U.S. 106, 113]\n\u00a0\n for the purpose of reviewing the decree of the court of appeals, and that is the extent of the jurisdiction here. Original objections to the auditor's report and the decree of the supreme court, not brought forward in the court of appeals, cannot be made here. Alleged errors not of a fundamental or jurisdictional character, which were not presented to the appellate court for consideration, and which were waived, either expressly or by implication, will not be regarded as before this court. Montana R. Co. v. Warren, \n137 \nU.S. 348, 351\n, 34 S. L. ed. 681, 682, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 96; Gila Valley, G. & N. R. Co. v. Hall, \n232 \nU.S. 94, 98\n, 58 S. L. ed. 521, 523, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229; Grant Bros. Constr. Co. v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 647, 660\n, 58 S. L. ed. 776, 784, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 452. We shall, then, consider the assignments of error which were brought to the attention of the district court of appeals.\n First, as to the allowance to the trustees of 5 per cent commission on the principal, and 10 per cent on the income. As to this allowance, the auditor made a lengthy finding of fact, setting forth in detail the services rendered by the trustees over a period of ten years, finding, as to the character of the estate, that the great bulk thereof was second trust notes of small amounts, as to which the auditor says that the transactions were almost innumerable, the total number of notes approximating three thousand, and he sets forth in detail other services involving care of the real estate, looking after the repairs of the property, acquiring parcels of real estate, and the sale thereof, and saying in conclusion that he had no hesitancy in finding that the trustees were well entitled to the commissions allowed. This allowance met with the approval of both the District supreme court and the court of appeals, and seems to have the sanction of an earlier decision of this court, where it was said that such allowances were customary in Maryland and the District of Columbia. Barney v. Saunders, 16 How. 535, 542, 14 L. ed. 1047, 1050. We are not, therefore, prepared to disturb the decree of the courts below in this respect. \n\n[235 U.S. 106, 114]\n\u00a0\n The next exception involves the allowance of the item of $18,800 in the probate court of Massachusetts, and charging the trustees with the balance of the estate after that allowance had been made. It appears that the executors Richardson and Drury appeared on April 4, 1899, in the Massachusetts probate court, and by petition set forth that they had been appointed and had given bond and due notice of their appointment as executors of the will of William A. Richardson; that there was not at the time of the grants of the letters testamentary, and had not been since, property belonging to the testator in the commonwealth of Massachusetts; that since the granting of letters testamentary Isabel Magruder, the only surviving child and heir at law of the said testator, had deceased, and that under and by the terms and provisions of said will it was provided that upon her decease the property of the testator should be held by the executors of said will for the benefit of the two minor children surviving the said daughter, namely, Alexander Richardson Magruder, of the age of sixteen years, and Isabel Richardson Magruder, of the age of about thirteen years; that these children, who were interested as beneficiaries in the trusts created by the will, at the time of the probate thereof and ever since had resided at Washington, in the District of Columbia; that Samuel Maddox and Samuel A. Drury had been appointed by the supreme court of the District of Columbia trustees for said minors, to carry out the provisions of said will in behalf of the said minors, and that Alexander F. Magruder had been appointed guardian of said minors; and they further represented to the court that William A. Richardson was not, at the time of his decease, a resident of Massachusetts, but of the District of Columbia, and that all the parties in interest under the will, at the time of the probate thereof, lived in Washington, as they had since and did then. They represented that the will should have been probated- \n\n[235 U.S. 106, 115]\n\u00a0\n at Washington, in the District of Columbia, but either by accident or mistake, probate in the probate court of Middlesex county, Massachusetts, was had, and they asked an order that they be authorized to pay over the trust funds to the trustees appointed by the supreme court of the District of Columbia, and that, upon the payment of such funds to such trustees, they be discharged from further liability.\n A decree was entered in the probate court of Massachusetts on April 11th, 1899, wherein it was found that by the decree of the supreme court of the District of Columbia, dated April 1st, 1899, Samuel Maddox and Samuel A. Drury had been duly appointed trustees to perform the trusts of the will, and that the beneficiaries were residents of Washington, and that the guardian of the minors had signified his consent to the granting of the petition, and that the laws of the District of Columbia secured the performance of the trusts, and Richardson and Drury, as executors, were authorized to pay over the trust funds to Maddox and Drury, as trustees. On April 25th, 1899, in the same probate court, Richardson and Drury, as executors, filed their first and final account, in which they charged themselves with property in the aggregate of $415,458.37, and asked to be allowed sundry payments and charges. This account was indorsed with a request for its allowance, signed by Alexander R. Magruder and Isabel R. Magruder, by their guardian, Alexander F. Magruder, and by Maddox and Drury, as trustees. On the 25th of April, the probate court made the following order: 'The foregoing account having been presented for allowance, and verified by the oath of the accountant, and all persons interested having consented thereto in writing, and no objection being made thereto, and the same having been examined and considered by the court, it is decreed that said account be allowed.' The schedules attached show the property and the payments, charges, losses, and \n\n[235 U.S. 106, 116]\n\u00a0\n distributions, among others the item of $18,800, to which exception is made. This item states: 'Expense of administration, including care of property, the payment of debts, the making of final account, the collection of notes amounting to $226,607.54, the investment in trust notes of $166,958.21, the collection from interest and other sources of $ 58,168.94, the payment of about $50,000 for repairs on real estate, the taking up of prior mortgages, taxes, etc., including also the payments of moneys to Isabel Magruder and to Alexander F. Magruder, the guardian of their minor children, counsel fees incurred in the defense of suits for taxes in Massachusetts and for counsel fees in Washington, etc., . . . $18, 800.'\n The auditor held that he had no authority to disregard or change this item of credit; that the same had been included in the reports of his predecessors and confirmed by the court; and that the allowance, having been made in the probate court of Massachusetts, was not open to review.\n The court of appeals of the District of Columbia, in the course of its opinion in this case, states that the appellants contended that there was no jurisdiction in the probate court of Massachusetts to probate the will,-a position which counsel for the appellant in this case disclaims in his brief filed herein, and says that the contention is that the order and decree in Massachusetts was not intended to be operative to diminish the accountability of the executors and trustees to the District of Columbia court. But we do not so interpret the proceedings. The account was filed in the Massachusetts court; and, the record recites, was examined and considered by the court and duly allowed. This order, reads in connection with the rules of the Massachusetts court set out at the head of the account, stating the authority of the court to allow reasonable expenses and compensation, shows that it was the intention of the probate court to make an \n\n[235 U.S. 106, 117]\n\u00a0\n allowance including such expenses and compensation. Apart from the concession of the jurisdiction here made, we have no doubt that the Massachusetts court, on the presentation of the will, had the right to determine its jurisdiction to receive and probate the same, and upon ordering the property turned over to the trustees appointed in the District of Columbia, to settle the account and fix the compensation of the executors, and order the balance turned over to the trustees. True, the Massachusetts court held, in the case of Dallinger v. Richardson, 176 Mass. 77, supra, that Richardson was not a resident of Massachusetts. In the course of the opinion in that case, the court points out that, for the purpose of the tax question, the matter of residence was not foreclosed by the adjudication of the probate court, whether in accordance with the truth or not.\n It is well settled that the decree of the court which has acquired jurisdiction of an estate and settled an account cannot be collaterally attacked (Jennison v. Hapgood, 7 Pick. 1, 7, 19 Am. Dec. 258). In that case it was held that what assets came into the executor's hands, what debts he had paid, and so of every matter properly done or cognizable in the probate court, the judgment of that court is conclusive. See also Abbott v. Bradstreet, 3 Allen, 587. There was no attempt to probate the will in the District of Columbia, in which event the finding of the fact of domicil in the proceedings in Massachusetts would not have been conclusive here. Overby v. Gordon, \n177 U.S. 214\n, 44 L. ed. 741, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 603. The trustees were authorized to receive the assets from the executors. The probate court in Massachusetts, and no other court, had authority to settle the executors' accounts and determine their compensation. Vaughan v. Northup, 15 Pet. 1, 10 L. ed. 639. We cannot agree with counsel for the appellant that the order of the probate court was based upon consent only, and that this is a case for the application of the rule that the trustees' consent to such a decree \n\n[235 U.S. 106, 118]\n\u00a0\n cannot work to the prejudice of the beneficiaries of the trust. Whether the guardian might give such consent, we do not find it necessary to decide, for the decree shows that the account was presented, verified by the oath of the accountants, and that it was examined and considered by the court.\n The next exception involves the allowance of commissions on the notes purchased from Mr. Drury's firm. The contention before the auditor was that one trustee had received compensation in connection with the handling of these investments, and that that should be taken into account. As to this exception, the auditor finds that 'the fact clearly appears from the testimony that Arms & Drury, as real estate brokers, made loans on trust notes, upon which loans they were paid by the borrowers a commission ranging from 1 to 2 per cent, according to the circumstances of the case, many being building loans; that subsequently, as notes of the trust estate were paid off, Mr. Drury would reinvest the moneys of the estate in trust notes held by Arms & Drury, paying the face value and accrued interest on the notes so purchased.' As a matter of law, the auditor concluded: 'No profit was made by the firm of Arms & Drury on sales of the notes to the trustees. . . . The transactions of Arms & Drury with the trustees were in the regular course of their business, in which they had their own moneys invested. They cost the estate not a penny more than if the transactions had been with some other firm or individual. If the firm of Arms & Drury, out of their own moneys, made loans on promissory notes, upon which loans were paid by the borrower the customary brokerages, those were profits on their own funds, in which this estate could have no interest, and in which it could acquire no interest by reason of the subsequent purchase of those notes by the trustees for their real value, any more than could any of the purchasers of such notes from Arms & Drury claim such an \n\n[235 U.S. 106, 119]\n\u00a0\n interest. No charge of malfeasance or misfeasance is made against the trustees, or that, by reason of these transactions, the trustees benefited in any manner out of the money of this estate. On the contrary, the relation of the firm of Arms & Drury to Drury and Maddox, trustees, benefited the estate, by enabling the trustees at all times to make immediate reinvestment of its funds, without loss of income, and by enabling the trustees to at all times readily procure reinvestments without payment of brokerage,-a brokerage not uncommonly charged the lender for placing his money, as well as the borrower for procuring his loan in times of stringency. The application of the well-known rule in equity should rather, therefore, be in favor of the trustees than against them with respect to these transactions. The objection narrows itself to a claim that Drury, by reason of his position as trustee, should, in addition to the benefit of his valuable services, commercial knowledge, and business acumen, make the estate a gift of profits on his individual moneys, to which the estate is in no wise entitled, and to which it could not make a semblance of reasonable claim had the trustees been other than Drury, or the agents of the estate been other than Arms and Drury.' This view seems to have met ruction of viaduct by railway company\/. a like view was taken by the court of appeals of the District of Columbia (37 App. D. C. 505, supra).\n It is a well-settled rule that a trustee can make no profit out of his trust. The rule in such cases springs from his duty to protect the interests of the estate, and not to permit his personal interest to in any wise conflict with his duty in that respect. The intention is to provide against any possible selfish interest exercising an influence which can interfere with the faithful discharge of the duty which is owing in a fiduciary capacity. 'It therefore prohibits a party from purchasing on his own account that which his duty or trust required him to sell on account of another, \n\n[235 U.S. 106, 120]\n\u00a0\n and from purchasing on account of another that which he sells on his own account. In effect, he is not allowed to unite the two opposite characters of buyer and seller, because his interests, when he is the seller or buyer on his own account, are directly conflicting with those of the person on whose account he buys or sells.' Michoud v. Girod, 4 How. 503, 555, 11 L. ed. 1076, 1099\n\n\n It makes no difference that the estate was not a loser in the transaction, or that the commission was no more than the services were reasonably worth. It is the relation of the trustee to the estate which prevents his dealing in such way as to make a personal profit for himself. The findings show that the firm of which Mr. Drury was a member, in making the loans evidenced by these notes, was allowed a commission of 1 to 2 per cent. This profit was in fact realized when the notes were turned over to the estate at face value and accrued interest. The value of the notes when they were turned over depended on the responsibility and security back of them. When the notes were sold to the estate it took the risk of payment without loss. While no wrong was intended, and none was in fact done to the estate, we think nevertheless that upon the principles governing the duty of a trustee, the contention that this profit could not be taken by Mr. Drury, owing to his relation to the estate, should have been sustained.\n We find no other error in the proceedings of the Court of Appeals, but for the reason last stated, its decision must be reversed, and the cause remanded to that court with directions to remand the cause to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMALONE v.

COHEN(1914)\nNo. 160\nArgued: Decided: June 8, 1914\n\n\n\n The defendant in error was the plaintiff below, and sued the Manhattan Life Insurance Company, which we shall speak of as the company, on two policies on the life of Jacob Cohen in his own favor, written in 1893, in Texas, where Cohen resided, the company then doing business in that state through an agency. It was averred that although the company had admitted liability on the policies, it had not paid the loss, and was therefore responsible \n\n[234 U.S. 123, 124]\n\u00a0\n not only for the sum due insured, with interest, but also for 12 per cent as statutory penalty or damages, and $1,000 attorneys' fees.\n The answer denied liability to the plaintiff. It admitted issuing the policies, but averred that in 1907 the insured, Cohen, borrowed $875 on each, and pledged the policies as security, which loans were unpaid. It was averred that in July, 1907, Cohen sold to Hilsman, of Atlanta, Georgia, his interest in the policies, and executed assignments and orders on the company to deliver the policies to him on payment of the debts for which they were pledged. These documents were annexed to the answer. The origin and course of the negotiation which ultimated in the assignments were thus stated: Hilsman had an agent at San Antonio, Texas, where Cohen lived. The transactions 'were begun' and 'definitely agreed upon' between Cohen and the agent, 'the agreement being that Hilsman would pay Jacob Cohen $460 for his equity in said policies, whereupon Cohen wired Hilsman to send papers, and the following correspondence, by letter and telegram, passed between them.' Hilsman in answer to the first telegram from Cohen wrote, inclosing him assignments of the policy and necessary notices to the company, with directions for their execution, and asking, besides, for certain papers which he required to show Cohen's ownership free from the claims of other persons, the letter ending with the statement, 'Send all the papers that are herewith inclosed, duly executed, in a sealed envelop, with this draft attached (evidently the draft for the price), and upon arrival, if in good shape, we will duly honor.' Cohen replied by letter, explaining that he did not have particular papers which had been asked for, but had others which he thought were their equivalent, and proposing to execute the assignment and send these papers, the letter concluding with the statement, 'if this meets with your approval, please wire me upon receipt of this letter, and I \n\n[234 U.S. 123, 125]\n\u00a0\n shall forward papers.' Hilsman answered by telegram favorably, and confirmed it by letter, saying that if the papers were sent, 'we will promptly honor the draft, provided the papers are in good shape.' On the day the telegram last referred to was received, Cohen transmitted the executed papers with the accompanying documents by mail, saying, 'I beg to inclose all documents . . . which I trust you will find correct, and will honor my draft for $460 attached to these documents.' The answer specifically alleges that the draft was sent from San Antonio for collection through a bank in that place, and as the answer states that the draft was attached to the papers, and this conformed to the instructions which we have seen were given by Hilsman to Cohen, the answer therefore in effect averred that the papers and draft were delivered to a bank in San Antonio, to be transmitted to Atlanta, the papers to be delivered to Hilsman if, after examination, he found the papers satisfactory and paid the draft. The answer then, in paragraph 8, contained the following averments:\n'Said Jacob Cohen, Hilsman, and his said agent, were engaged in speculative transactions, and said assignments were made as a part of and in connection with a certain transaction in what is commonly called 'cotton futures,' the money being paid to and received and used by Jacob Cohen to speculate in the future price of cotton, without its being contemplated that there would be actual delivery thereof, or bargain and sale, and said Hilsman or his said agent, being interested in the transaction, and the purpose of the transaction being known by all the parties, which purpose was carried into effect, through the said agency of J. H. Hilsman and J. H. Hilsman, he being engaged in the brokerage business.'\n\n It was averred that after the death of Cohen, both his executor and Hilsman, as owners of the policies, made demand upon the company for payment; that the company admitted liability to someone, and simply professed its \n\n[234 U.S. 123, 126]\n\u00a0\n desire to have the matter as to who was owner of the policies settled so that it might make payment with safety. To reach this result it was alleged that an unsuccessful effort was made to have the parties agree to appear in a suit where, as to both of them, the company admitting liability, their rights might have been determined; and that failing in this respect, and being advised that under the law of Georgia, where the assignment to Hilsman was made, it was legal, and therefore his claim was valid, as the most expeditious way of clearing up the matter the company paid Hilsman, and took from him an indemnity bond. While admitting that before the assignment and at the time of its delivery Hilsman had no interest whatever in the life of Cohen, it was nevertheless averred that the assignment of the policies was valid ana authorized under the laws of the states of Georgia and New York. Averring, moreover, that all the acts of the company in the premises had been in good faith, and arose not from any desire to deny liability, but simply from an honest purpose to have it determined who owned the claims under the policy, it was asserted that there could be in no event any liability for interest by way of damages and for the attorneys' fees as prayed.\n By leave the plaintiff amended his petition 'in replication and answer to . . . the answer of the defendant, Manhattan Life Insurance Company,' and asserted, among other things, that the assignments of the policies alleged in the answer were void upon two distinct grounds: (1) Because 'under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Texas, the state of New York, and the state of Georgia, and each of them, an assignment of a life insurance policy to a person without insurable interest in the life of the insured is invalid and not binding upon the assignor or his representative.' (2) Because 'said alleged assignments of the policies of insurance sued upon herein are invalid and not binding upon it, and were without legal consideration un- \n\n[234 U.S. 123, 127]\n\u00a0\n der the laws of the state of Texas, the state of New York, and the state of Georgia, for this: that at the time that said assignments and each of them were made, executed, and delivered, that the said Jacob Cohen, J. H. Hilsman, and his said agent, were engaged in speculative transactions, and that said assignments and each of them were made as a part of and in connection with the said transactions in what is commonly called 'cotton futures,' the money being paid to and received and used by the said Jacob Cohen to speculate in future prices of cotton without its being contemplated that there would be actual delivery thereof, or bargain and sale; the said Hilsman and his agent being interested in the transaction, and the purpose of the transaction being at and before the time known to and by all the parties, which said purpose was carried into effect through the said agency, J. H. Hilsman and J. H. Hilsman, he being engaged at that time in the brokerage business; all of which said facts were well known to the defendant insurance company at and before the time that it paid the said policies to the said Hilsman, as in its said answer alleged and set forth.'\n For the purpose of the trial by the court without a jury a written statement of facts was agreed to by both parties in the form of petitioner's case, the case of the defendant company, and the reply of the petitioner. The statement of the plaintiff admitted the issue of the policies, the lending of the money by the company, and the pledging of the policies to secure it, the transfer or assignment by Cohen for the consideration we have stated, and under the circumstances which we have detailed, the gambling nature of the transaction being expressly stated in accordance with the averment of the answer of the company, and with the allegation of the amended pleading of the plaintiff, the death of Cohen, the claim of both parties on the insurance company, the effort of the company to secure a suit to which both the claimants should be parties in order to \n\n[234 U.S. 123, 128]\n\u00a0\n relieve it from responsibility, its failure to secure that result, and its payment to Hilsman of the amount upon the giving by him of indemnity, all substantially as alleged in the pleadings we have stated. The agreed facts contained this statement:\n'It was not the purpose of the insurance company to contest or delay payment, and the payment to Hilsman was made under the circumstances above set out. It is not the purpose of this agreement to determine how far, if at all, the facts in respect to notice and good faith are material issues in this case, that being deemed a question of law; nor is this agreement to be construed as admitting as a matter of law that Hilsman had any right to said policy or their proceeds, or that said payment, or any part thereof, was rightfully made to him. It is, however, agreed as a fact that Hilsman has not been repaid said sum of $460, and the insurance company has not been repaid the amount of said loan, except as above stated, and that nothing has yet been paid to the plaintiff.'\n\n The company, as part of its case, introduced certain statutes of the state of Georgia and decisions of the court of last resort of that state, interpreting the same for the purpose of showing that Cohen had a right to sell and Hilsman to purchase in Georgia the insurance policies, although Hilsman had no insurable interest in Cohen's life. In rebuttal the plaintiff introduced certain decisions of the court of last resort of Georgia, deemed to establish the contrary result, and also offered statutes of that state dealing with gambling transactions and the right to sue concerning the same. The trial court found the facts substantially as embodied in the statements referred to.\n Mr. William J. Moroney for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[234 U.S. 123, 130]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wilmer S. Hunt, Sterling Myer, and C. A. Teagle for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 123, 131]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Upon the pleadings which we have just stated and the facts stipulated, the trial court gave judgment for the plaintiff, Cohen, against the defendant company for the amount of the policies, less the sums which had been loaned thereon by the company, with interest, and with the statutory penalties and attorneys' fees claimed.\n To recapitulate, it suffices to say that the assignments of error made by the company in the court below for the \n\n[234 U.S. 123, 132]\n\u00a0\n purpose of the appeal by it taken but expressed the defenses resulting from its answer and the stipulated facts which we have stated. That is to say, reliance was placed (1) upon the proposition that, in any event, the recourse of the plaintiff was against Hilsman, and not against the company ; (2) that the transfer of the policies to Hilsman was a Georgia contract, and valid under the law of that state because the existence of insurable interest at the time of the transfer, although necessary under the Texas law, was not necessary under the Georgia law; (3) that as, in any event, the transaction out of which the assignment of the policies from Cohen to Hilsman grew was admittedly a gambling one, the court would not allow the executor of Cohen to derive any rights from assailing that transaction, but would leave the parties where their illegal contract had placed them; that is, let the assignment to Hilsman stand, and hence leave no right in Cohen, executor, to recover; (4) that the court erred in giving judgment for the statutory penalties and damages because, under the circumstances stated, the liability to pay them was not embraced by the statute under which they were imposed, and that if the statute, as construed, imposed the damages and attorney's fee which were allowed, it was in violation of  1 of the 14th Amendment.\n In an elaborate opinion the court disposed of all these contentions. It held that the suit need not be brought against Hilsman, but that it could be brought directly against the company. It decided that the contract of assignment was a Texas contract, and for want of insurable interest in Hilsman was invalid under the laws of that state, although it was in substance admitted that it would have been valid, so far as the question of insurable interest was concerned, if it had been a Georgia contract. Coming to consider the fact that both parties had conceded that the transaction out of which the assignment of the policies grew was purely of a gambling nature, and that that fact \n\n[234 U.S. 123, 133]\n\u00a0\n had been stipulated, the court refused to sustain the following proposition which was insisted upon by the defendant company: 'When an insurance policy is assigned as part of a gaming transaction, the law will give no relief to either party, or to their heirs, executors, or assigns, regardless of all other questions, but will leave the parties where they have voluntarily placed themselves.' [-- Tex. Civ. App. --, 139 S. W. 58.] On the contrary, the court, relying upon the Texas law upon that subject, the Georgia law on the same subject, and the principles of general law applicable thereto, held that instead of leaving the assignment growing out of the gambling transaction enforceable in the hands of Hilsman, it would, in consequence of the illegality, strike down the whole transaction, and therefore leave the policy in the hands of Cohen, the insured, to whom it belonged before the assignment had been made. And for this reason also the court decided that the sum paid by Hilsman for the transfer need not be repaid by Cohen in order to recover. On the subject of the penalties the court, referring to the cases of Fidelity Mut. Life Asso. v. Mettler, \n185 U.S. 308\n, 46 L. ed. 922, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 662, and Farmers' & M. Ins. Co. v. Dobney, \n189 U.S. 301\n, 47 L. ed. 821, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 565, held that the statute under which they were imposed was not repugnant to the 14th Amendment, and said: 'The action of the insurance company in paying the money due on the policies was not, as in South-western Ins. Co. v. Woods Nat. Bank, -- Tex. Civ. App. --, 107 S. W. 119, an offer of the insurance company to pay to the one of the two real claimants when it should be determined who he was, but a voluntary payment to the rival claimant, who had no right whatever to the amount due on the policy. The company has indemnified itself against its act in paying the money due on the policy to one who was not entitled to receive it; now let it resort to its indemnity.'\n At the threshold we must dispose of a motion to dismiss. It is apparent from the statement of the case that the only express assertion of Federal right had reference to \n\n[234 U.S. 123, 134]\n\u00a0\n the statutory penalty and the attorney's fee. The assignments of error, however, assert violations of rights under the Constitution in many particulars, but more especially with reference to the action of the court in treating the sales of the policies as Texas contracts, and refusing to apply the Georgia law, which admittedly differed fundamentally from that of Texas. It is elementary that a Federal question may not be imported into a record for the first time by way of assignments of error made for the purposes of review by this court. Moreover, as a general rule, it is true that for the purposes of review by this court rights under the full faith and credit clause,  1, article 4 of the Constitution, come within that class which are required to be expressly set up and claimed in the court below. Johnson v. New York L. Ins. Co. \n187 U.S. 491\n, 47 L. ed. 273, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 194; El Paso & S. W. R. Co. v. Eichel, \n226 \nU.S. 590, 597\n, 57 S. L. ed. 369, 373, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 179; Chicago, I. & L. R. Co. v. Hackett, \n228 \nU.S. 559, 565\n, 57 S. L. ed. 966, 968, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 581. Let it be conceded, as we think it must be, where the record leaves no doubt that rights under the full faith and credit clause were essentially involved and were necessarily passed upon, there would be jurisdiction to review even although such rights had not been expressly asserted below ( see Tilt v. Kelsey, \n207 \nU.S. 43, 51\n, 52 S. L. ed. 95, 99, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1 ); the right to review under such condition being in effect but a result of the elementary rule that it is irrelevant to inquire how and when a Federal question was raised in a court below when it appears that such question was actually considered and decided. But these concessions are irrelevant, even although it be further conceded that the ruling of the court below as to the necessity for an insurable interest, and its governing the case by the law of Texas instead of by the law of Georgia, bring this case within the doctrines just stated. We say this because of the existence of another and fundamental question which causes the concessions stated to be immaterial. Both parties, as we have seen, wholly independent of the existence of an in- \n\n[234 U.S. 123, 135]\n\u00a0\n surable interest, affirmed the illegality of the transaction out of which the assignments of the policies grew because of the alleged gambling nature of the transaction, and the admitted facts without dispute established that situation. There being thus an admission by both parties, and no dispute concerning the illegality of the transaction, and a difference only as to the consequences to arise from such illegality, it follows that the case reduces itself to a consideration of that subject. But, on coming to its consideration, it is plain that no question concerning the full faith and credit clause was involved in any contention made below by the plaintiff in error in that regard, since the rights deduced from the admitted illegality of the transaction were placed solely on considerations of the local law of the state of Texas and of the state of Georgia, deemed to be applicable to such condition of things, or upon what was deemed to be the controlling principles of general law on the subject. Indeed, so absolutely is this the case that, as we have seen, the company itself insisted on the illegality and based rights upon it. And it was only on behalf of the defendant in error that considerations involving the full faith and credit clause were suggested as controlling the results in consequence of the admitted illegality of the transaction as a gambling one. A condition which is illustrated by the fact that the reply petition of the plaintiff, while accepting and reiterating the averment of illegality made in the answer of the defendant company, in addition specially alleged that the illegality resulting from the gambling transaction caused the assignment of the policies to be void under the law of New York, where the company was organized, and under the law of Texas, as well as under the law of Georgia. And it was for this reason that the proof which was offered as to the statute law of Georgia on the subject of gambling transactions and the decision or decisions of that state, which it was deemed made the statute applicable, were tendered on behalf of the plaintiff, \n\n[234 U.S. 123, 136]\n\u00a0\n and not by the defendant company. It would be indeed anomalous when the parties had both relied upon the illegality of the transaction upon grounds wholly independent of any Federal right, and the case had been decided upon that ground, which, in and of itself, is sufficient to sustain the action of the court below, to permit one of the parties, because of his dissatisfaction with the application of such principles, to assert the existence of jurisdiction because the case rested on a Federal issue. It becomes, hence, obvious that the assignments of error outside of the one referring to the repugnancy to the 14th Amendment of the statute imposing damages and penalties affords not the slightest pretext for the exercise of jurisdiction, and they therefore may be put out of view.\n Coming to consider the latter subject, it may not be doubted that the nonrepugnancy of the assailed statute to the Constitution of the United States has been directly determined by this court in the cases upon which the lower court based its ruling. Fidelity Mut. Life Asso. v. Mettler, \n185 U.S. 308\n, 46 L. ed. 922, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 662; Farmers' & M. Ins. Co. v. Dobney, \n189 U.S. 301\n, 47 L. ed. 821, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 565. But it is said that, as previously upheld, the statute, as construed by the state court, contemplated a liability for the penalties or damages and attorneys' fees only in case there was a wilful refusal to pay, and therefore those decisions have no application here, since the statute, as applied in this case, enforces a liability against the company in spite of its action in the utmost good faith, taken solely for the purpose of determining to whom it must pay the sum due, liability as to which was frankly conceded. But the deduction simply disregards the basis upon which the court below rested its conclusion, and invites us upon a conception of injustice to commit a wrong by reviewing a matter of purely local concern which is not within our cognizance. We say this because clearly the court below rested its conclusion as to liability for the penalty and damages not upon the construction of the \n\n[234 U.S. 123, 137]\n\u00a0\n statute suggested, but upon the premise that the payment to Hilsman by the insurance company of the sum of the policies under the circumstances stated was a payment which took it out of the category of a mere stakeholder seeking to discharge his duty in good faith, and placed it in the position of a person espousing the cause of one as against the other, and thereby subjecting himself to the legal consequences arising from such action. And the considerations which we have stated also dispose of the contention concerning the wrong which it was insisted was done in declaring the assignment of the policies void because of the gambling nature of the contract, and yet permitting the assignor to hold on to the price paid for such assignment. That question was involved in and controlled by the court's ruling concerning the illegal nature of the transaction and the principles applicable thereto, and therefore it is beyond our competency to review.\n As the repugnancy of the statute concerning the damages and attorney's fee was the only semblance of ground for invoking our jurisdiction, and as that ground was conclusively established to be without merit when the writ of error was sued out, it follows that there is nothing upon which to base jurisdiction, and the writ of error must be dismissed.\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCCABE v.

Warner, and Mr. Charles West, Attorney General of Oklahoma, for appellees.\n\n\n[235 U.S. 151, 158]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The legislature of the state of Oklahoma passed an act approved December 18, 1907 (Okla. Comp. Laws, 1910,  860 et seq.), known as the 'separate coach law.' It provided that 'every railway company . . . doing business in this state, as a common carrier of passengers for hire,' should 'provide separate coaches or compartments, for the accommodation of the white and negro races, which separate coaches or cars' should 'be equal in all points of comfort and convenience' ( 1); that at passenger depots there should be maintained 'separate waiting rooms,' likewise with equal facilities ( 2); that the term 'negro,' as used in the act, should include every person of African descent, as defined by the state Constitution ( 3); and that each compartment of a railway coach 'divided by good and substantial wooden partition, with a door therein, should be deemed a separate coach' within the meaning of the statute ( 4).\n It was further provided that nothing contained in the act should be construed to prevent railway companies 'from hauling sleeping cars, dining or chair cars attached to their trains, to be used exclusively by either white or negro passengers, separately but not jointly' ( 7).\n Other sections prescribed penalties both for carriers and for passengers failing to observe the law ( 5, 6). The act was to take effect sixty days after its approval ( 12).\n On February 15, 1908, just before the time when the statute, by its terms, was to become effective, five negro \n\n[235 U.S. 151, 159]\n\u00a0\n citizens of the state of Oklahoma (four of whom are appellants here) brought this suit in equity against the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railway Company, the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Company, the Missouri, Kansas, & Texas Railway Company, the Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway Company, and the Fort Smith & Western Railroad Company, to restrain these companies from making any distinction in service on account of race. On February 26, 1908,-after the act had been in operation for a few days,-an amended bill was filed seeking specifically to enjoin compliance with the provisions of the statute for the reasons that it was repugnant (a) to the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, (b) to the enabling act under which the state of Oklahoma was admitted to the Union (act of June 16, 1906, chap. 3335,  3, 34 Stat. at L. 267, 269), and (c) to the 14th Amendment. The railroad companies severally demurred to the amended bill, asserting that it failed to state a case entitling the complainants to relief in equity. The circuit court sustained the demurrers, and, as the complainants elected to stand upon their bill, final decree dismissing the bill was entered. This decree was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals (109 C. C. A. 110, 186 Fed. 966), and the present appeal has been brought.\n The conclusions of the court below, as stated in its opinion, were, in substance:\n\n 1. \nThat, under the enabling act, the state of Oklahoma was admitted to the Union 'on an equal footing with the original states,' and, with respect to the matter in question, had authority to enact such laws, not in conflict with the Federal Constitution, as other states could enact; citing, Permoli v. New Orleans, 3 How. 589, 609, 11 L. ed. 739, 748; Escanaba & L. M. Transp. Co. v. Chicago, \n107 \nU.S. 678, 688\n, 27 S. L. ed. 442, 446, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 185; Willamette Iron Bridge Co. v.

That it had been decided by this court, so that the question could no longer be considered an open one, that it was not an infraction of the 14th Amendment for a state to require separate, but equal, accommodations for the two races. Plessy v. Ferguson, \n163 U.S. 537\n, 41 L. ed. 256, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1138\n\n\n 3. That the provision of  7, above quoted, relating to sleeping cars, dining cars, and chair cars, did not offend against the 14th Amendment, as these cars were, comparatively speaking, luxuries, and that it was competent for the legislature to take into consideration the limited demand for such accommodations by the one race, as compared with the demand on the part of the other.\n\n 4. \nThat, in determining the validity of the statute, the doctrine that an act although 'fair on its face' might be so unequally and oppressively administered by the public authorities as to amount to an unconstitutional discrimination by the state itself (Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 373\n, 30 S. L. ed. 220, 227, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1064) was not applicable, as there was no basis in the present case for holding that any discriminations by carriers which were unauthorized by the statute were practised under state authority.\n\n 5. \nThat the act, in the absence of a different construction by the state court, must be construed as applying to transportation exclusively intrastate, and hence did not contravene the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. Louisville, N. O. & T. R. Co. v. Mississippi, \n133 \nU.S. 587, 590\n, 33 S. L. ed. 784, 785, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 801, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 348; Chesapeake & O. R. Co. v.

Cas. 980.\n\n 6. \nThat with respect to the existence of discriminations the allegations of the bill were too vague and uncertain to entitle the complainants to a decree.\n In view of the decisions of this court above cited, there is no reason to doubt the correctness of the first, second, fourth, and fifth of these conclusions.\n With the third, relating to  7 of the statute, we are \n\n[235 U.S. 151, 161]\n\u00a0\n unable to agree. It is not questioned that the meaning of this clause is that the carriers may provide sleeping cars, dining cars, and chair cars exclusively for white persons, and provide no similar accommodations for negroes. The reasoning is that there may not be enough persons of African descent seeking these accommodations to warrant the outlay in providing them. Thus, the attorney general of the state, in the brief filed by him in support of the law, urges that 'the plaintiffs must show that their own travel is in such quantity and of such kind as to actually afford the roads the same profits, not per man, but per car, as does the white traffic; or, sufficient profit to justify the furnishing of the facility; and that in such case they are not supplied with separate cars containing the same. This they have not attempted. What vexes the plaintiffs is the limited market value they offer for such accommodations. Defendants are not by law compelled to furnish chair cars, diners, nor sleepers, except when the market offered reasonably demands the facility.' And in the brief of counsel for the appellees, it is stated that the members of the legislature 'were undoubtedly familiar with the character and extent of travel of persons of African descent in the state of Oklahoma, and were of the opinion that there was no substantial demand for Pullman car and dining car service for persons of the African race in the intrastate travel' in that state.\n This argument with respect to volume of traffic seems to us to be without merit. It makes the constitutional right depend upon the number of persons who may be discriminated against, whereas the essence of the constitutional right is that it is a personal one. Whether or not particular facilities shall be provided may doubtless be conditioned upon there being a reasonable demand therefor; but, if facilities are provided, substantial equality of treatment of persons traveling under like conditions cannot be refused. It is the individual who is entitled to \n\n[235 U.S. 151, 162]\n\u00a0\n the equal protection of the laws, and if he is denied by a common carrier, acting in the matter under the authority of a state law, a facility or convenience in the course of his journey which, under substantially the same circumstances, is furnished to another traveler, he may properly complain that his constitutional privilege has been invaded.\n There is, however, an insuperable obstacle to the granting of the relief sought by this bill. It was filed, as we have seen, by five persons against five railroad corporations to restrain them from complying with the state statute. The suit had been brought before the law went into effect, and this amended bill was filed very shortly after. It contains some general allegations as to discriminations in the supply of facilities and as to the hardships which will ensue. It states that there will be 'a multiplicity of suits,' there being at least 'fifty thousand persons of the negro race in the state of Oklahoma' who will be injured and deprived of their civil rights. But we are dealing here with the case of the complainants, and nothing is shown to entitle them to an injunction. It is an elementary principle that, in order to justify the granting of this extraordinary relief, the complainant's need of it, and the absence of an adequate remedy at law, must clearly appear. The complainant cannot succeed because someone else may be hurt. Nor does it make any difference that other persons who may be injured are persons of the same race or occupation. It is the fact, clearly established, of injury to the complainant-not to others-which justifies judicial intervention. Williams v. Hagood, \n98 \nU.S. 72, 74\n, 75 S., 25 L. ed. 51, 52; Marye v.

Rep. 286.\n The allegations of the amended bill, so far as they pur- \n\n[235 U.S. 151, 163]\n\u00a0\n port to show discriminations in the conduct of these carriers, are these:\n'That notwithstanding the terms of said act of Congress and of the Constitution of the state of Oklahoma, the said above-named defendants and each of them are making distinctions in the civil rights of your orators and of all other persons of the negro race and persons of the white race in the conduct and operation of its trains and passenger service in the state of Oklahoma, in this, to wit: that equal comforts, conveniences, and accommodations will not be provided for your orators and other persons of the negro race; that said passenger coaches are not constructed or maintained so as to enable persons of the negro race to be provided with separate and equal toilet and waiting rooms for male and female passengers of said negro race, nor have equal smoking car accommodations, nor sepaarate and equal chair cars, sleeping cars, and dining car accommodations by providing for your orators and other persons of the negro race who may become passengers on said railroad, that separate waiting rooms with equal comforts and conveniences have been or are bound to be constructed by said defendants and each of them for your orators and other persons of the negro race desiring to become passengers on said railroad, and that said orators are not being and will not be provided with equal accommodations with the white race under the provisions of said act.'\n\n We agree with the court below that these allegations are altogether too vague and indefinite to warrant the relief sought by these complainants. It is not alleged that any one of the complainants has ever traveled on any one of the five railroads, or has ever requested transportation on any of them; or that any one of the complainants has ever requested that accommodations be furnished to him in any sleeping cars, dining cars, or chair cars; or that any of these five companies has ever notified any one of \n\n[235 U.S. 151, 164]\n\u00a0\n these complainants that such accommodations would not be furnished to him, when furnished to others, upon reasonable request and payment of the customary charge. Nor is there anything to show that in case any of these complainants offers himself as a passenger on any of these roads and is refused accommodations equal to those afforded to others on a like journey, he will not have an adequate remedy at law. The desire to obtain a sweeping injunction cannot be accepted as a substitute for compliance with the general rule that the complainant must present facts sufficient to show that his individual need requires the remedy for which he asks. The bill is wholly destitute of any sufficient ground for injunction, and unless we are to ignore settled principles governing equitable relief, the decree must be affirmed.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Chief Justice White, Mr. Justice Holmes, Mr. Justice Lamar, and Mr. Justice McReynolds concur in the result. \n\n\n\n","129":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCDONALD v.

It was alleged that this strip, which traversed property belonging to the defendants, had been bought from them by the railroad company for a cash price of $600, which was paid, but nevertheless the defendants, asserting some title to the land, were threatening to disturb the railroad in its possession, to tear up a track where laid, and otherwise to prevent the use of the land for the purpose for which it had been bought. The defendants answered, and although \n\n[233 U.S. 665, 667]\n\u00a0\n admitting that they had sold the land to the railway for a right of way, and had received the stipulated price, nevertheless asserted that they were yet the owners of the property for the following reasons: (a) Because in the deed by which the property was conveyed there was an express condition 'that the Oregon Railraod & Navigation Company will construct the line of road over the above-described premises within two years from the date hereof.' (b) Because while after the deed the railroad had commenced to construct its road, and had graded along the right of way, after doing so it suspended all work so that the two years provided in the deed elapsed without the railroad being built, and therefore all right to the land had been lost, and the defendants had reentered and notified the railroad of the fact.\n Averring that the land was 'reasonably worth the sum of $1,000 and the plaintiff has not paid the same nor any part thereof, and has not offered to pay defendant anything for said land since its failure to comply with the condition of the deed,' the answer prayed not merely the rejection of the plaintiffs' demand and the dissolution of the injunction which had been allowed, but asked substantive relief; that is, that the defendants be decreed to be the owners, and that the complainant be enjoined from in any way interfering with them, and for the awarding of 'such other and further relief as shall seem to the court equitable in the premises.' After trial at which considerable testimony was taken, among other things, as to the value of the property, the court, holding in favor of the defendants, decided that the railroad, by virtue of its failure to build within the period specified, and the re-entry of the defendants, had lost all right to the land, and therefore that the subsequent action of the railroad in entering upon the land to complete its railroad was a trespass. The injunction which was issued at the inception of the cause was dissolved. On appeal the court below expressly \n\n[233 U.S. 665, 668]\n\u00a0\n adopted the legal principles which the trial court had applied; that is, the court likewise declared the cause in the deed to be a condition, and decided that the failure of the railroad to comply with its terms had forfeited all its right and title in and to the land. But nevertheless the decree was not affirmed. After expounding its reasons for fully agreeing with the legal conclusions of the trial court, it was said: 'So far, then, we have found that defendants were entitled to a forfeiture and that the land has reverted, but we now recur to the remedy. The situation is anomalous. Plaintiff has constructed its road and has it in operation, thereby preforming an important public function for a large and increasing population. . . . It is to the interest of the public that it should continue to do so, and that the defendants should not be allowed to acquire a portion of its roadbed to the detriment of public travel. The condemnation of land for railway purposes is usually the function of a court of law, but there are in this case such special circumstances as to authorize this court to end the whole litigation at once and forever. The pleadings show that this land is needed for the purpose of a railway, and the evidence shows that the railway is actually there on the ground. Defendants come into court, submit themselves to the jurisdiction of equity, and ask affirmative relief. Much of the testimony was devoted to showing the value of the land taken, the effect of the taking on the remainder of the tract, and all those things which are usually shown in an action to condemn for a railroad right of way. Having jurisdiction of this case, we have concluded to assume it for all purposes, and to so modify the decree that plaintiff shall take title to the land described in this strip upon the paying to defendants the damage occasioned by such taking, which we assess at $700, and the costs and disbursements of this suit.' [ 58 Or. 236, 32 L.R.A.(N.S.) 117, 112 Pac. 413.] Upon the entry of a decree conformably to these views, the defendants asked that the decree be \n\n[233 U.S. 665, 669]\n\u00a0\n modified so as to confine it to a recognition of their title, and to exclude all its provisions conferring upon the railroad company the right to take the property on paying the adjudged sum. This application was supported by an elaborate argument challenging the right of the court under the state law to exert the power which it had exerted. In none, however, of the elaborate arguments pressed to sustain the motion to modify, was there any reference whatever to any supposed denial by the state court of rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, and for that reason, and because it is insisted that, on the face of the record, it is manifest no Federal question is presented, a motion to dismiss has been made which we come to consider.\n All the contentions as to Federal rights rest upon the assumption that the court below denied due process of law when it entered the decree complained of, and this is based upon the conception that the court exceeded its jurisdiction and misconceived or wrongfully interpreted the evidence, and thereby in effect, while recognizing the title of the plaintiffs in error, virtually deprived them of the right conferred by the state law of having a common-law trial for the purpose of determining the questions which would require to be decided in case of the exercise by the railroad company of the right of eminent domain, including, of course, the fixing of compensation to be paid for the taking and the damages incident thereto. Leaving aside for the moment the question of the jurisdiction of the court in the fundamental sense, that is, ratione materioe, it is manifest that the want of foundation for all the propositions insisted upon is quite clear, since, after all, taking the aspect most favorable for the plaintiffs in error, the propositions but assert that the court below, in deciding the case, committed error as to matters involving no Federal question because purely of state cognizance. It is elementary and needs no citation of authority to show that \n\n[233 U.S. 665, 670]\n\u00a0\n the due process clause of the 14th Amendment does not control methods of state procedure or give jurisdiction to this court to review mere errors of law alleged to have been committed by a state court in the performance of its duties within the scope of its authority concerning matters non- Federal in character. So far as the contentions addressed themselves to the subject-matter of jurisdiction, it is clear that they do not deny jurisdiction in the sense of the fundamental absence of any and all right to take cognizance of the cause, but are confined to jurisdiction in the sense of the duty to rightfully decide subjects to which judicial power extends. In this aspect the error of all the contentions is within the principle announced in Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 U.S. 674\n, 42 L. ed. 622, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229.\n But, aside from the reasons just stated, the absolute want of merit in the Federal right asserted becomes doubly apparent when it is observed that the plaintiffs in error, who were defendants in the trial court, did not simply stand upon their rights as defendants, but went further and sought affirmative relief at its hands, and could only be now heard to deny all power by being permitted to deny the right to exert the very jurisdiction which they invoked.\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","130":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCGOVERN v. PHILADELPHIA & READING R CO(1914)\nNo. 430\nArgued: November 30, 1914Decided: December 14, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 389, 390]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George Demming for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 389, 395]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William Clarke Mason and Charles Heebner for defendant in error.\n\n\n[235 U.S. 389, 397]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Action in trespass under the railroad employers' liability act of Congress of April 22, 1908 [35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, Comp. Stat. 1913 ,  8657], as amended April 5, 1910 [36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1010], brought against the railway company, which, it is alleged, caused by negligence the death of Peter McGovern, one of its employees. Plaintiff was duly appointed administratrix of the estate of McGovern, and brought the action in behalf of his surviving parents, who are citizens of Great Britain and Ireland.\n McGovern was not married, was twenty-four years old, and was in the habit of making regular contributions to the support of his parents. The facts of the killing are not now in dispute, the principal question in the case being whether, under the act of Congress, and action can be maintained for the benefit of nonresident aliens.\n There were two trials of the action. At the first trial plaintiff obtained a verdict. On motion of the railway company, the court, being of opinion that the action could not be maintained for the benefit of nonresident aliens, granted a new trial. 209 Fed. 975. On the second trial the railway company submitted to the court for its affirmance the following propositions, among others: (1) The parents of McGovern, being nonresident aliens, have no right under the act of Congress for which the action might be maintained, and therefore a verdict should be directed in favor of the company. (2) Under all of the evidence in the case a verdict should be for the company. The court affirmed the propositions and directed a verdict for the company. The jury returned a verdict accordingly, and judgment was duly entered for the railway company. This writ of error was then sued out.\n It is suggested rather than urged that the case is not properly here on direct appeal. But the right of direct \n\n[235 U.S. 389, 398]\n\u00a0\n appeal is based on the ground, among others, that the construction and application of the treaty between the United States and Great Britain and Ireland are involved in the case, the favored-nation clause of which gives the residents and citizens of Great Britain and Ireland the same rights as those of Italy, and that by a treaty between the latter and the United States its citizens are entitled to exactly the same rights as citizens of this country in the courts of this country, although the citizens of Italy may be residing abroad.\n In its first opinion in the case the district court discussed at length the question arising upon the treaty, and held adversely to plaintiff. We must presume, therefore, that the court considered the treaties as elements in its decision upon the right of McGovern to recover for the benefit of the parents of the deceased. This court, therefore, has jurisdiction.\n We need not, however, discuss the treaties. The view we take of the statute makes such course unnecessary. But see Maiorano v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. infra.\n Section 1 of the act of Congress provides that every common carrier by railroad, while engaged in interstate commerce, 'shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce, or, in case of the death of such employee, to his or her personal representative for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children of such employee; and if none, then of such employee's parents . . .' the carrier or its agents being negligent or its instrumentalities being defective, due to its negligence. Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Horton, \n233 \nU.S. 492, 501\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1062, 1068, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 635.\n In ruling upon the statute the district court considered that the reasoning in Deni v. Pennsylvania R. Co. 181 Pa. 525, 59 Am. St. Rep. 676, 37 Atl. 558, and in Maiorano v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. \n213 U.S. 268\n, 53 L. ed. 792, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 424, applied. In the Deni Case the supreme court of Penn- \n\n[235 U.S. 389, 399]\n\u00a0\n sylvania, passing upon a statute of the state which permitted certain named relatives to recover damages for death occurring through negligence, held that the statute had no extraterritorial force, and that plaintiff in the action was not within its purview, though its language possibly admitted of the inclusion of nonresident aliens. The Maiorano Case came to this court on writ of error to the supreme court of Pennsylvania, where the doctrine of the Deni Case was repeated and applied. This ruling was simply accepted by this court as the construction of the state statute by the highest court of the state.\n We concede some strength of persuasion to the Pennsylvania decision, but to it may be opposed the ruling in other jurisdictions. Mulhall v. Fallon, 176 Mass. 266, 54 L.R.A. 934, 79 Am. St. Rep. 309, 57 N. E. 386; Kellyville Coal Co. v. Petraytis, 195 Ill. 217, 88 Am. St. Rep. 191, 63 N. E. 94; Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Fajardo, 74 Kan. 314, 6 L.R.A.(N.S.) 681, 86 Pac. 301. In the latter case and in Mulhall v. Fallon many other cases are reviewed, including English and Canadian cases, and it was concluded that the weight of authority in this country and in England was that alienage is not a condition affecting a recovery under acts such as that involved in the case at bar.\n In Patek v. American Smelting & Ref. Co. 21 L.R.A.(N.S.) 273, 83 C. C. A. 284, 154 Fed. 190, the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit passed on a statute of Colorado which gave a right of action for wrongful death to persons standing in certain relation to one whose death was caused by the wrongful act of another. The court, after considering the policy of the act, as manifested in the legislation, and reviewing the cases under other statutes of like character, said: 'We think that the better reason, as also the greater weight of adjudged cases, forbids that nonresident aliens be excluded, by interpretation, from among the beneficiaries designated in the statute.'\n We may refer to these cases for their reasoning without reproducing it, and need not do much more than add that \n\n[235 U.S. 389, 400]\n\u00a0\n the policy of the employers' liability act accords with and finds expression in the universality of its language. Its purpose is something more than to give compensation for the negligence of railroad companies. Even if that were its only object, we might accept the distinction expressed in Mulhall v. Fallon, supra, between the duties imposed by a statute upon persons in another state and benefits conferred upon them. Extraterritorial application would naturally not be given to the first, 'but rights can be offered to such persons, and if, as is usually the case, the power that governs them makes no objection, there is nothing to hinder their accepting what is offered.' Ibid.\n The rights and remedies of the statute are the means of executing its policy. If this 'puts burdens on our own citizens for the benefit of nonresident aliens,' as said by the district court, quoting the Deni Case, supra, it is a burden imposed for wrong-doing that has caused the destruction of life. If is to the prevention of this that the statute is directed. It is for the protection of that life that compensation for its destruction is given and to those who have relation to it. These may be wife, children, or parents. The statute, indeed, distinguishes between them, but what difference can it make where they may reside? It is the fact of their relation to the life destroyed that is the circumstance to be considered, whether we consider the injury received by them or the influence of that relation upon the life destroyed.\n It is, however, contended by the railway company that the deceased, McGovern, assumed the risk of his employment. This is attempted to be supported by the facts in the case. The testimony of plaintiff tended to show the following facts: McGovern was killed by a train bound from New York to Philadelphia while he was engaged in cleaning snow from the tracks of the railway company when there were mist, smoke, and occasional flurries of \n\n[235 U.S. 389, 401]\n\u00a0\n snow. At the place where the men were working were four main lines of trackage. Shortly after 9 o'clock the men were warned off what was called track No. 4 by a call of the foreman to 'look out' or 'heads up,' in order to let a local train pass by.\n McGovern and two others were working on track No. 2. There was no call to them, the practice of the foreman being to designate the track in his warning, the men on the other track continuing to work. The foreman testified that he did not see the New York train 'because it was a bad morning, snowing, and the Norristown train was a little bit slack, and there was steam and smoke and snow in front of the New York train.' The New York train gave no signal and no warning was given of it. It was testified that the watchman had got his feet wet and had gone to change his shoes. And it was also in testimony that the Norristown train was slow and the New York train came fast, and that while the men were attracted by the first, the other rushed down upon them.\n There was testimony by the railway company that the engine whistled. One witness called it a 'wicked whistle,' and there was also testimony that the men and McGovern directly were warned that they were working in a dangerous place, and to be careful.\n There was testimony that the watchman was not absent, and that it was his duty to notify the workmen of approaching trains; that the company, besides, have subforemen to direct the workmen; that the men are 'told to be careful' and to watch for themselves 'and depend upon the subforeman, of course. . . . No man should continue working if he sees a train coming.' It further appeared that the place where the accident occurred was regarded as a dangerous place, the tracks being in frequent use.\n It is hence contended by the railway company that McGovern assumed the risk of the situation, and that, there- \n\n[235 U.S. 389, 402]\n\u00a0\n fore, it was error for the district court to refuse to give an instruction which presented that contention.\n We have given the testimony in general outline, but enough to show that what conflict there was in it was for the jury to judge of and what deductions there were to be made from it were for the jury to make. And the district court, being of this view, refused to charge the jury, as we have seen, that McGovern had asssumed the risk of the situation. We cannot say that, as a matter of law, the court was mistaken. We see no error, therefore, in its ruling.\n Plaintiff in error contends that the District Court should not have ordered a new trial because she offered to waive her rights to a trial by jury. This was not error.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded for new trial. \n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMEEKER v.

Direct error is prosecuted to that court (now the district court) because of the asserted repugnancy of the following statute of the state upon which the recovery was based, to the due process clause of the 14th Amendment:\n'The owner of a motor vehicle shall be liable for any injury occasioned by the negligent operation by any person of such motor vehicle, whether such negligence consists in violations of the provision of a statute of this state, or in the failure to observe such ordinary care in such operation as the rules of the common law require; but such owner shall not be so liable in case such motor vehicle shall have been stolen.' [ 2 How. Anno. Stat. 1913,  2496.]\n\n The injuries complained of were caused by the negli- \n\n[233 U.S. 36, 41]\n\u00a0\n gence of a chauffeur in operating an automobile owned by the defendant company, resulting in a collision on the highway with plaintiff's horses and the cart in which he, with two others, was riding. Although the driver of the automobile was in the employ of the defendant company as a car tester and chauffeur, he was not at the time of the accident (about mindnight) engaged in the company's business, but had taken the car without the knowledge or consent of the company, and in violation of its rules, for the purpose of pleasure-riding with his friends. Under these facts, aside from the statute, the court below charged the jury, and it is not here disputed, that the plaintiff could not recover under the law of Michigan for the injuries suffered, and hence that his right to recover, if any, was exclusively under the statute.\n The duty of considering the contention here urged, the unconstitutionality of the statute, is rendered unnecessary by decisions of the supreme court of the state since the trial of this case, in which the statute was held void because in conflict with both the state and the United States Constitutions. Daugherty v. Thomas, 174 Mich. 371, 45 L.R.A.( N.S.) 699, 140 N. W. 615; Barry v. Metzger Motor Car Co. 175 Mich. 466, 141 N. W. 529. We say this because while it is undoubtedly our duty to decide for ourselves whether the statute is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, we must accept the ruling of the state court as to the repugnancy of the statute to the state Constitution. As the effect of the state decision on that subject is to determine that ab initio the statute was void, and as there was admittedly no right to recover in the absence of a valid statute, the obvious duty to reverse results.\n There is a suggestion in the argument that prior to the decisions of the state court to which we have referred, which expressly held the statute to be unconstitutional, there had been a ruling of that court deciding it not to be repugnant to the state Constitution. Johnson v. Sergeant, 168 Mich. 444, \n\n[233 U.S. 36, 42]\n\u00a0\n 134 N. W. 468, 2 N. C. C. A. 334. But it is to be observed that as to that ruling the court in the Daugherty Case declared that the statement as to the constitutionality of the statute made in the Johnson Case was merely obiter. Even, however, if this were not the case, we cannot now treat as existing a statute which the court of last resort of the state declares cannot be enforced compatibly with the state Constitution. And as here there is no claim of rights acquired under contract in the light of a settled rule of state interpretation of a state law of Constitution, there is no foundation whatever for upholding assumed rights which can alone rest upon the existence of a state statute when the state court of last resort has held there is no valid statute to sustain them.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMIEDREICH v.

Michener, Perry G. Michener, and Peter Maier for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error, by complaint filed in the superior court of Vanderburgh county, state of Indiana, sought to vacate a judgment of foreclosure rendered by that court in a prior case, and to be permitted to redeem the property therin involved, and prays for other relief; and, judgment having been entered in favor of the defendant in error, which was affirmed by the supreme court of Indiana (172 Ind. 140, 86 N. E. 963, 87 N. E. 1029), this writ of error was sued out.\n The facts, so far as pertinent to our review, are: The complaint, in the fourth paragraph, alleged that the plaintiff in error was the owner of certain property, subject to a mortgage foreclosed in a former suit; that she was a minor when the foreclosure proceedings were had; that she was not a resident of Vanderburgh county, where the action was brought, but was and had been for many years \n\n[232 U.S. 236, 242]\n\u00a0\n a resident of Gibson county, and that she was not summoned in such action, had no knowledge of its pendency, and did not waive service or enter her appearance therein. It was further alleged that the plaintiff in error was not amenable to the jurisdiction of the sheriff of Vanderburgh county, but that, although she was not served with process, he made a false return of a pretended summons, by which the court was wrongfully imposed upon, and, being so advised, at the instance of attorneys for the predecessor of defendant in error, the court appointed a guardian ad litem for her, who answered in the suit, and that a decree was rendered, her property sold, and bid in by the predecessor of the defendant in error. The demurrer of the defendant in error to this paragraph, thus construed, was sustained by the lower court, and its decision affirmed by the supreme court. Other paragraphs of the complaint alleged fraud on the part of the predecessor of the defendant in error and her attorneys. The lower court found against this charge, and the supreme court, after stating that there was legal evidence to support the finding, refused to disturb it.\n The record is meager of attempts to raise a Federal question by reason of alleged violations of rights secured by the Constitution of the United States, aptly set forth and referred to in some proper way, and it is contended by the defendant in error that the writ should be dismissed for that reason. We find in the opinion of the supreme court of Indiana a statement that 'both parties have treated this suit as one arising under the provisions of the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution, and as presenting the questions of due process of law and rights guaranteed by article 1,  21, of the state Constitution,' and the court, after making this statement, takes up the various grounds of attack upon the original decree for alleged fraudulent service or want of service upon the minor defendant in the foreclosure proceedings, \n\n[232 U.S. 236, 243]\n\u00a0\n and disposes of them against the contention of the plaintiff in error. There is no repudiation of the position of both parties that questions were raised under the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, and we think the court may be fairly taken to have regarded such questions as duly before it for consideration. Where a state court holds that a Federal question is made before it, according to its practice, and proceeds to determine it, this court will regard the question as duly made.

It is urged that upon this writ of error this court should re-examine the conclusions of fact just referred to and the rulings of the supreme court of Indiana in respect thereto. This court has repeatedly held that in cases coming to it from the supreme court of a state, it accepts as binding the findings upon issues of fact duly made in that court. Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 86, 107\n, 53 S. L. ed. 417, 428, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 220: Rankin v. Emigh, \n218 \nU.S. 27, 34\n, 54 S. L. ed. 915, 920, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 672; Kerfoot v. Farmers' & M.

The case does not come within the exceptional class of cases where what purports to be a finding of fact is not strictly such, but is so involved with and dependent upon questions of law bearing upon the alleged Federal right as to be a decision of those questions rather than of a pure question of fact, or where there is that entire lack of evidence to \n\n[232 U.S. 236, 244]\n\u00a0\n support the conclusion upon the Federal question that gives this court the right of review.

Rep. 820.\n The supreme court of Indiana stated the question upon the decision of which the Federal question of due process arises as follows:\n'The question is then presented whether the allegations that appellant was a minor, was not a resident of Vanderburgh county, was a resident of Gibson county, and had been for many years, that no summons was served on her, that she had no knowledge of the proceedings, did not waive service, nor did anyone for her, or in her behalf or with her consent, enter appearance for her, that she was not amenable to the jurisdiction of the sheriff of Vanderburgh county, that, notwithstanding that she was not served with process, the sheriff of Vanderburgh county made a false return of a summons, and the court was wrongfully imposed upon by such false return, and, being thus falsely advised, at the instance of appellant's attorneys [i. e., the attorneys for the predecessor of the defendant in error], appointed a guardian ad litem for her,-constitute a charge of fraud. The return was regular on its face. The court had jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and apparently jurisdiction of the person of appellant. The false return was not procured by the fraud, collusion, or imposition of the plaintiff or his [her] attorneys [in the foreclosure suit]. It is not alleged that either knew of the fact that there had been no service on appellant. The allegations practically present this question: If, without any fraud, or any act on the part of a party to an action or his attorney, a return is made by a sheriff showing service, regular on its face, without knowledge of the party that there was in fact no service, and no act is done \n\n[232 U.S. 236, 245]\n\u00a0\n or thing said to mislead the sheriff, is it an imposition or fraud upon the court to present such summons and return and obtain a judgment upon it, and is it a charge of fraud or imposition upon the court to allege that the court was wrongfully imposed upon by such false return, and was thus falsely advised? The whole allegations must be taken together, and the scope and theory of the paragraph, as we construe it, is that the court was misled by a false return of the sheriff. The court had a right to rely and act upon the return. It imports verity to the court. The sheriff assumes the responsibility, in taking the office, of seeing to it that he does make the right service. Nichols v. Nichols (1884) 96 Ind. 433; State ex rel. Robinson v. Leach (1858) 10 Ind. 308; State ex rel. Chapman v. Lines (1853) 4 Ind. 351.\n\n'If this were not true, no litigant could ever know when his rights were adjudicated and set at rest; and, to the end that the party may be made whole, an action for a false return will lie. Splahn v. Gillespie ( 1874) 48 Ind. 397; Rowell v. Klein (1873) 44 Ind. 290, 15 Am. Rep. 235.\n\n'If it be said that the amount of bond a sheriff is required to give might not cover the damage in any or every case, it is sufficient to say that that is a legislative matter, and not a judicial one.'\n\n The question then is, does the ruling predicated upon the principles thus stated, made in the state court wherein the party has been duly heard, amount to a denial of due process of law within the meaning of the Federal Constitution?\n This court has recognized the difficulty of satisfactorily defining in general terms which shall apply to all cases what is meant by the term 'due process of law,' and the desirability of judicial determination upon each case as the question arises. Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n, 24 L. ed. 616. If the exercise of judicial power be such 'as the settled maxims of law permit and sanction, and under such \n\n[232 U.S. 236, 246]\n\u00a0\n safeguards for the protection of individual rights as those maxims prescribe for the class of cases to which the one in question belongs,' there has been no deprivation of due process of law. Cooley, Const. Lim. 7th ed. 506; Leigh v. Green, \n193 \nU.S. 79, 87\n, 48 S. L. ed. 623, 626, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 390. And this court, speaking by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, in Leeper v. Texas, \n139 \nU.S. 462, 468\n, 35 S. L. ed. 225, 227, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 577, said: 'Law in its regular course of administration through courts of justice is due process, and when secured by the law of the state, the constitutional requirement is satisfied.' This language was quoted with approval in Iowa C. R. Co. v. Iowa, \n160 \nU.S. 389, 393\n, 40 S. L. ed. 467, 469, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 344.\n In the present case the state has made provision for the service of process, and the original party in the foreclosure proceeding did all that the law required in the issue of and attempt to serve process; and, without fraud or collusion, the sheriff made a return to the court that service had been duly made. The duty of making such service and return by the law of the state is delegated to the sheriff, and, although contrary to the fact, in the absence of any attack upon it, the court was justified in acting upon such return as upon a true return. If the return is false, the law of the state, as set forth by its supreme court, permitted a recovery against the sheriff upon his bond. We are of the opinion that this system of jurisprudence, with its provisions for safeguarding the rights of litigants, is due process of law. It may result, unfortunately, as is said to be the fact in this case, that the recovery upon the sheriff's bond will not be an adequate remedy, but statutes must be framed and laws administered so as to protect as far as may be all litigants and other persons who derive rights from the judgments of courts. So far as this record discloses, the purchaser at the sheriff's sale had a right to rely upon the record, which imported verity as to the nature of the service upon the plaintiff in error. If this were not true, as the supreme court of \n\n[232 U.S. 236, 247]\n\u00a0\n Indiana points out, there would be no protection to parties who have relied upon judicial proceedings importing verity, upon the faith of which rights have been adjudicated and value parted with. In a case of this character the law must have in view, not only the rights of the defendant who has been a victim of a false return on the part of the sheriff, but of persons who have relied upon the regularity of the return of officials necessarily trusted by law with the responsibility of advising the court as to the performance of such duties as are here involved. Were the law otherwise, titles might be attacked many years after they were acquired, where the party had been guilty of no fraud, and had acted upon the faith of judicial proceedings apparently perfect in every respect.\n This has been the rule of law applied to a similar situation in the courts of other states.

Rep. 257.\n Without the necessity of deciding more in the present case, it is enough to say that the decision of the supreme court of Indiana, made under the circumstances detailed, did not, in our opinion, deprive the plaintiff in error of due process of law within the meaning of the 14th Amendment.\n It follows that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Indiana should be affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMILLER v. U S(1914)\nNo. 178\nArgued: Decided: April 6, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Louis T. Michener and Perry G. Michener for appellant.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Thompson for appellee: \n\n[233 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The petition claimed $51,736 because of an alleged violation of a contract to carry the mails over a mentioned route in Alaska. The United States demurred on the ground that no cause of action was stated, and the court having sustained the demurrer and dismissed the petition, the case is here. The text of the petition, therefore, is the matter we are called upon to consider. It covers sixteen pages of the printed record. We shall seek to rearrange its contents so as to enable us with accuracy and yet with brevity to state the substance of the petition in order to determine whether a cause of action was stated.\n It was alleged that on September 15th, 1905, the United States advertised for proposals to carry the mails over a route in Alaska from Valdez to Eagle, a distance of 428 miles, and back. The advertisement conveyed information concerning the route and the duty which would rest upon the contractor, and contained the following:\n'The Postmaster General may order an increase of service on a route by allowing therefor not to exceed a pro rata increase on the contract pay. He may change schedules of departure and arrivals in all cases, and particularly to make them conform to connections with railroads, without increase of pay, provided the running time be not abridged. The Postmaster General may also discontinue, change, or curtail the service in order to place on the route superior service, or whenever the public \n\n[233 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n interest, in his judgment, shall require such discontinuance, change, or curtailment for any other cause, he allowing a full indemnity to contractor one month's extra pay on the amount of service dispensed with, and not to exceed pro rata compensation for the amount of service retained and continued; but the Postmaster General reserves the right to rescind any acceptance of a proposal at any time before the signing on behalf of the United States of the formal contract, without the allowance of any indemnity to the accepted bidder.'\n\n Under this proposal the bid of John B. Crittenden to do the called- for work at $46,000 per annum was accepted, and on the 1st of February, 1906, a contract was entered into between the government and Crittenden and his sureties, John Miller and Charles H. Cramer, for performing the services for the sum of the bid for the period of four years from the 1st of July, 1906, to June 30th, 1910. The written contract contained specifications as to the character of the work, its requirements and the mode of its performance, which it is not here necessary to detail. Besides a full stipulation giving the Postmaster General authority to enforce the contract and all its provisions by imposing penalties and forfeitures, and by discontinuing the contract in case of nonperformance, as embodied by the provisions which are reproduced in the margin, the contract contained the following:\n And it is hereby further stipulated and agreed by the said contractor and his sureties that the Postmaster General may annul the contract or impose forfeitures in his discretion for repeated failures or for failure to perform service according to contract; for violating the postal laws or regulations; for disobeying the instructions of the Postoffice Department; for refusing to discharge a carrier, or any other person having charge of the mail by the contractor's direction, when required by the Department; for subletting service without the consent of the Postmaster General, or assigning or transferring this contract; for combining to prevent others from bidding for the performance of postal service; for transmitting commercial intelligence or matter which should go by mail, contrary to the stipulations herein; for transporting persons so engaged as aforesaid; or for the failure of the contractor to give his personal supervision to the performance of the service, and to reside upon or contiguous to the route; that the Postmaster General may annul the contract whenever the contractor shall become a postmaster, assistant postmaster, or member of Congress, or otherwise legally incompetent to be concerned in such contract; and whenever, in the opinion of the Postmaster General, the service cannot be safely continued, the revenues collected, or the laws maintained on the road or roads herein. \n\n[233 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n 'It is hereby stipulated and agreed by the said contractor and his sureties that the Postmaster General may discontinue or extend this contract, change the schedule and termini of the route, and alter, increase, decrease, or extend the service, in accordance with law, by allowing not to exceed a pro rata increase of compensation for any additional service thereby required; and, in case of decrease, curtailment, or discontinuance of service, as a full indemnity to said contractor, one month's extra pay on the amount of service dispensed with, and not to exceed a pro rata compensation for the service retained; but no increase of compensation shall be allowed for a change of service not amounting to an increase, nor indemnity of month's extra pay for any change of service not involving a decrease of service.'\n In addition the statutory provisions governing the subject and the Postoffice regulations having the force of law which had been stated in the advertisement for proposals were by reference incorporated and made a part of the contract by the following provision:\n'That this contract is further to be subject to all the conditions imposed by law, and by the several acts of Congress relating to postoffices and post roads, and to the conditions stated in the pamphlet advertisement of September 15, 1905.'\n\n It was averred that shortly after the making of the contract Miller, the petitioner, who was one of the sureties of \n\n[233 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n Crittenden, found that he was not able to supply the capital needed for the performance of the contract, and therefore he, Miller, as surety, was obliged to and did expend the moneys needed to buy 'harness, sleds, horse feed, horses, and dogs to carry the mails' under the contract, so that by the 1st of July, 1906, the contractor was ready to perform and did commence the performance of his duties under the contract, and continued to perform them until the time when subsequently the contract was discontinued by the Postmaster General. It was averred that after thus advancing the money as surety of Crittenden, Miller, finding that further advances were necessary to enable Crittenden to go on with his work, formed a partnership with him, and under this partnership advanced large sums of money to meet the heavy expenses which were required, and continued to do so, during a period of nearly two years; that is, up to or on or about the 1st of May, 1908, when he was compelled, in order to protect himself and the United States, to take a transfer of the contract from Crittenden; that is, to become the sublessee of the contract, his written agreement dated the 1st of May, 1908, with Crittenden to that effect having been approved by the Postoffice authorities; indeed, it was alleged that such agreement was written by those authorities. This subletting contract which was set out in full in the petition bound Miller, the subcontractor, by all the obligations of the original contract, made him liable for all fines, forfeitures, etc., imposed under the original contract, and expressly subjected him to the risk of the power to change, increase, modify, or discontinue the service as provided in the original contract, the clauses covering these two latter subjects being in the margin. \n And it is hereby further agreed that liability for all fines and deductions imposed upon a party of the first part by the Postmaster General, for failures and delinquencies in the performance of service under his contract, shall be assumed and borne by the party of the second part, and, if necessary, the Auditor for the Postoffice Department may enforce this agreement by proper deductions from any compensation due the party of the second part for service performed under this subcontract.\n And it is hereby further agreed that for any additional service required by the Postmaster General, and not hereinbefore expressly stitpulated, the party of the second part shall be allowed not to exceed a pro rata increase of compensation; and, in case of decrease, curtailment, or discontinuance of service, as full indemnity a pro rata of the one month's extra pay allowed by the United States to the party of the first part, and, unless previously herein stipulated, not to exceed a pro rata compensation for the service retained. \n\n[233 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n It was alleged that the petitioner as subcontractor performed the contract as long as he was permitted to do so by the United States; that on the 11th of August, 1908, the Postmaster General issued an order discontinuing the contract service over the route which the contract embraced, to take effect on the 30th of September, 1908, and this order was enforced at the time mentioned and an indemnity allowance of pay for one month only was made the contractor. The petition alleged that for many years 'the regulations adopted and enforced by the Postoffice Department have authorized the Postmaster General to discontinue or curtail the service in whole or in part, in order to secure 'a better degree of service,' or 'superior service,' or whenever the public interest in his judgment should require its discontinuance or curtailment for any other cause, he allowing as a full indemnity to the contractor, one month's extra pay on the amount of service dispensed with and pro rata compensation for the amount of service retained and continued.' The continuance of this regulation was alleged, and the various changes in the mere form in which it was expressed up to and including the time when the regulation then existing found statement in the contract and in the proposals subject to which, as we have seen, the contract was made. The petition, however, averred as follows: \n\n[233 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n 'The regulation, whatever its language or its number, was not drawn and promulgated with reference to the conditions existing in Alaska on Route No. 78,108 during the period covered by the contract sued on, but it was drawn and promulgated with reference to conditions existing within the limits of the United States and exclusive of that route in Alaska, and particularly without reference to the hereafter described conditions existing in that part of Alaska covered by the contract sued on.\n'In the preparation of the forms of advertisement, proposal, and contract in suit, the government officials adopted the regulation in force, and such advertisement, proposal, and contract were drawn and printed for general use, and the proposal and contract were presented for execution without particular regard to the physical, climatic, or other conditions then existing or that might exist along the line of that route during the contract period of four years. At the execution of the proposal and contract, and of the subsequent contract of subletting, Crittenden and petitioner did not think or believe that the contract in suit would be discontinued or terminated in any manner of form, but, on the contrary, they believed that the contract in suit would be in full force and effect during the whole contract period, and they named the amount of annual compensation in that belief. They expected that they would encounter losses of profits in a portion of the contract period, but would earn good profits before the contract period ended and for the whole contract period. Had Crittenden and the petitioner believed otherwise than as above stated, they would not have executed either of the contracts for that annual compensation, nor would petitioner have made the arrangements and expenditures in the early part of 1903 (1908) hereinafter described. On the contrary, petitioner made such arrangements and expenditures in the belief that the contract would be in force for the full contract period. Peti- \n\n[233 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n tioner avers that if the government had asked bids for a two-year contract on that route, Crittenden would not have submitted a bid at all, and petitioner would not have become surety on any contract for less than $92, 000 per annum, because the conditions were such that the expenses of carrying the mails on the route would be far heavier for carrying them in 1906 than in 1907, and in 1907 than in 1908, and in 1908 than in 1909. As an illustration, the petitioner avers that it cost, to wit: $151,169.55 to perform the contract until it was discontinued by order of the Postmaster General, that amount being to wit: $48,595.08 more than the total sum received from the government, but it would only have cost him, to wit: $43, 390 to perform the contract for the remaining twenty-two months of the contract period, during which time he would have received, to wit: $84,326 for carrying the mails; a profit of, to wit: $40,936.'\n\n The petition moreover alleged that the conditions which existed at the time the contract was made in the region covered by the mail route which it embraced caused it to be extremely difficult and hazardous to human life and property to carry the mails over the route described and within the time specified in the contract. In many places, it was averred, the government trails were not fit to be used because of their bad condition, and it became necessary to build new ones. With much amplitude, the petition described the almost insurmountable difficulties with which the performance of the contract was environed: the cutting of trails, the building or repairing of bridges, the erecting of sheds, the transporting at an enormous expense along the route of the means to sustain men and horses; the struggle in doing so in winter through ice and snow, and in spring and summer, the overcoming of obstacles resulting from flood and many other causes. Indeed, the facts detailed, being taken as true, establish that the performance of the contract was surrounded by difficulty of the \n\n[233 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n gravest character, to overcome which called for the manifestation on the part of the contractor of courage, the exertion of great energy, and a willingness to make sacrifices in order to discharge the duties imposed by the contract. It was alleged that the making of the strenuous exertion and the incurring of the hazards to life and property which, as we have stated, the petition described, were necessary, 'as the government did not make allowance for delays, whether caused by snows, storms, blizzards, the freeze-up in the fall, the break-up in the spring, or any other consideration, but fines were charged at every opportunity.'\n It was alleged that counting on the fact that the contract would be allowed to go to its termination, after the petitioner became the sublessee he spent a large amount of money in putting the route in fair condition, in provisioning the same by shipping food for men and horses at freight rates which were enormous, all of which he would not have done had he been informed of the intention of the government to discontinue the contract before the end of the contract period. That upon the same reliance, as a means of utilizing his equipment, he bought out the rights and assumed the obligations of a contract which had been made by a firm known as Scott & Frase for carrying the mails from a point known as Tanana Crossing to Eagle, the place where the contract of which the petitioner was the subcontractor terminated.\n It was alleged that although in September, 1908, the government discontinued the contract of petitioner, it did not discontinue the mail service to which that contract related, but only restricted it,-that is, cut out about 190 of the 428 miles between Valdes and Eagle, and in the balance had the mails carried by contracts exacting a less onerous and less frequent service, these contracts having been made as emergency contracts, without advertisement, without affording the petitioner any opportunity to bid \n\n[233 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n for them or to take them under the prior contract which was discontinued by the order of 1908. The sum which was claimed was the alleged loss resulting from having been obliged to discontinue the contract, the calculation in effect on the subject charging the amount spent under the contract as well as $41,129.52 as the result of the purchase of the Scott & Frase contract, and crediting the total amount received from the government.\n These being the averments of the petition, it is obvious, the questions are as follows: First, did the contract confer the authority on the United States to discontinue its performance, and, if so, did it give power to the Postoffice authorities after the contract was discontinued to deal with the mail routes which the contract had previously embraced in such a manner as was found necessary to subserve the public interest; second, if yes, did the averments of the bill show such a state of facts as would justify the conclusion that the action of the Postoffice authorities in exerting the lawful power of discontinuance was so impelled by bad faith as to cause the exertion of the otherwise lawful power to be invalid and void?\n That in explicit terms the express authority was given to the United States to discontinue the execution of the contract is so plainly the result of the proposal which led up to the contract, if the text of the contract itself, of the Postoffice rules and regulations which by the text were incorporated in and made a part of the contract, as to leave no room for discussion. Indeed, this result was in terms admitted by the allegations of the petition to which we have referred, and the challenge of the power to discontinue therein made conceded that the terms of the contract gave the power, but relied only upon the assertion that such terms, although express and positive, should be read out of the contract as inapplicable to the situation to which the contract related; that is, the carriage of the mail over the designated route in Alaska. \n\n[233 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n But we must be governed by the contract, and cannot, as we are asked to do, first destroy it in part and then enforce that which would remain, which would be the result of holding that the stipulations of the contract conferring power upon the government may be obliterated, and the contract, with those stipulations wiped out, be enforced as against the government for the benefit of the petitioner. And the absolutely conclusive force of this view, when considered as a general proposition, is at once additionally demonstrated by a particular consideration of the case in hand, since the reserve power on the part of the government to discontinue the contract which is here in question found its place in the proposal and contract in consequence of the postal regulations having the effect of law which had prevailed for many years, and which therefore caused the contract with the reservation of the right to discontinue to be but the expression of a rule of public policy limiting in the public interest the power to contract,-a limitation sanctioned over and over again at least by an unerring implication by statutory approval. Of course, under this condition of things, the suggestion that the contractor would not have bound himself to the government if he had considered that the unambiguous words of the contract would be enforced can be of no avail. And it is equally manifest that it is impossible to give any effect to the suggestion that the terms of the contract did not apply because of the place where the work covered by the contract was to be performed. The presumption is that whatever may have been the difficulties of performance, they were in the minds of the contracting parties, and were elements entering into the offer by the contractor to do the work for a stated compensation, and also constituted elements of danger against which the government protected itself by the express reservation of the right to discontinuance which was explicitly exerted. While it is not necessary to do so, we observe in passing that the aver- \n\n[233 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n ments of the petition itself give rise to inferences sustaining this very natural conclusion.\n That the power to discontinue the contract left the government free after such discontinuance to make such contracts as were deemed best is also the unambiguous result of the proposals submitted by the government, of the text of the contract itself, and of the context of the postal rules and regulations which by reference were incorporated into the contract. In fact, while the context establishes this result so clearly and so obviously as to leave no room for extraneous reasoning, if such were not the case, and purpose and intent required to be looked at, it is manifest that to deny that such power existed would be to set aside and frustrate the public policy upon which the right to discontinue rests. It would render the exertion of the power futile-or cause it to be inadequate to protect the public interest, since it would deprive of means of remedying the evil to cure which the right to discontinue was exerted. The irresistible force of the contract itself on the subject has been previously pointed out by this court in a case which was cited by the court below in its clear opinion. Slavens v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 229, 233\n, 236 S., 49 L. ed. 457, 459, 460, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229.\n Making the assumption, for the sake of the argument only, that the existence of a fraudulent motive or of bad faith impelling the exercise by the Postmaster General of the authority conferred upon him to discontinue be a factor in determining whether an otherwise valid power had been lawfully exerted, such concession could have no possible reference to this case, since it is expressly conceded in the argument at bar that no such charge was made in the petition and none is relied upon, the only claim being that a power not conferred was exerted, or that, if one which was given was exercised, the circumstances disclosed were of such a character as to justify the legal conclusion that it was so grossly inequitable to bring \n\n[233 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n the power into play that its exertion ought not to receive judicial sanction. But this simply calls upon us to substitute judicial discretion for the discretion lodged by the law and the contract in the Postmaster General,-a power which, of course, it is beyond our competency to exercise. Let it be conceded that if the truth be admitted of all the facts as to the unforeseen difficulties, the stress of storm and blizzard and snow and ice and freshet, which prevailed as averred over the trackless wilderness through which the mail route extended, a case of great hardship would be established, the vary truth of the averments referred to also naturally suggests the reasons which, in the exercise of a wise discretion, may have called into play the exertion of the power to discontinue the contract in the public interest and for the public benefit. As under the conditions stated the hardships alleged were but the result of a mistake of the petitioner in making an improvident contract, relief can only be obtained at the hands of Congress.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","135":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMINIDOKA & SOUTHWESTERN R.

Homesteaders, without patents, but lawfully in possession of irrigable land within the reclamation area, granted rights of way over their settlements to the railroad company.\n When the company began to build, the United States sought to enjoin the work on the ground that a railroad could not be built across lands within a reclamation area without the consent of the government. It was also claimed that the necessary embankments, excavations, bridges, and culverts, would interfere with the success of the irrigation works. The company answered and relied on the conveyances from the homesteaders. After a hearing the circuit court denied the injunction, but made provision that the culverts should be so built as not to interfere with the flow of water through the canals and ditches (176 Fed. 762). This decree was reversed by the circuit court of appeals (111 C. C. A. 323, 190 Fed. 491) on the ground that the lands in the reclamation area, though in possession of settlers, were public lands within the meaning of the right of way act (18 Stat. at L. 482, chap. 152, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1568 ), and that before its road could be built through the Minidoka Irrigation Works the company must obtain the consent of the Secretary of the Interior. From that decree an appeal was taken to this court.\n It has always been the policy of the government to encourage the building of railroads in the Western states, and many land grants have been made by it to aid in their construction. Congress has also provided a means by which those companies having no such grants could acquire rights of way over any portion of the public land by filing a map of definite location and securing its approval \n\n[235 U.S. 211, 216]\n\u00a0\n by the Secretary of the Interior (18 Stat. at L. 482, chap. 152, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1568). This law, however, by its very terms, applies only to 'public lands,' and hence cannot be construed to empower the Secretary to authorize the building of roads across lands which had been segregated from the public domain by the entry and possession of homesteaders or pre-emptors. Bardon v. Northern P. R. Co. \n145 U.S. 538\n, 36 L. ed. 809, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 856; United States v. Buchanan, \n232 U.S. 76\n, 58 L. ed. 514, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 237, and cases cited. On the other hand, settlers without patent were not in a position to make deeds to rights of way, not only because they had no title, but also because they were prohibited from alienating such land before final proofs. Rev. Stat.  2291, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1390. The consequence was that neither the government nor the homesteaders could make such grants, and as the company could not build without an assured title to its right of way, it was practically impossible to construct railroads through territory which consisted partly of public lands and partly of that which was in the possession of settlers. But it was greatly to their interest and to that of the government that such a highway should be constructed, and in order to meet the difficulty, Congress, on March 3, 1873 [17 Stat. at L. 602, chap. 266] (Rev. Stat.  2288, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1385), passed an act providing that any bona fide settler might convey by warranty against his own act 'any part of his claim for church, school, and cemetery purposes and for a right of way for railroads.' Under this act the appellant could have constructed its road along the strip conveyed to it by the homesteaders unless, as claimed by the government, the provisions of Rev. Stat.  2288, as amended (33 Stat. at L. 991, chap. 1424, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 592), have been repealed as to lands within irrigation projects and the completed Minidoka Irrigation Works.\n Counsel for the United States contend that the reclamation act (32 Stat. at L. 388, chap. 1093, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 662) requires that when an irrigation project is undertaken the Secretary of the Interior shall define its limits and withdraw all the \n\n[235 U.S. 211, 217]\n\u00a0\n irrigable land therein from the public domain and from the operation of the general land laws. It is argued that when thus withdrawn the irrigation area constitutes a unit in which the United States has such a special interest as to require that it shall be subject to the supervision of the Secretary,-he, in order to secure the success of the undertaking, having it in his power to decide whether a railroad should be built, and if so, along what line and across what lots it should be constructed. It is also argued that settlers having no patents ought not to be in a position to grant a right of way over lands which they do not own and may never acquire, and thereby impose a burden upon the claim if it should afterwards come into the hands of other homesteaders.\n These considerations, however, have not induced Congress to change its policy of encouraging the construction of railroads along routes designated by charters and over land in the possession of settlers. Neither have they induced Congress to confer upon the Secretary the power to grant rights of way through irrigation lands in the possession of homesteaders.\n It is true that the reclamation act of June 17, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 388, chap. 1093, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 662), provides that when the Secretary of the Interior determines upon an irrigation project he must define its limits and 'withdraw the irrigable lands therein from all forms of settlement, except under the homestead law,' and all settlements therein shall be 'subject to the limitations, charges, terms, and conditions provided in the reclamation act.' And it is further true that the provisions of this statute do, in several important respects, modify the homestead law. The Secretary can limit the size of the homestead to 10 acres, instead of 160 acres, permitted by the general law. The settler, instead of being entitled to receive a patent at the end of five years on compliance with the statutory conditions (Rev. Stat.  2289-2291, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 1388-1390), is not permitted to make final proof and \n\n[235 U.S. 211, 218]\n\u00a0\n receive a patent until he has reclaimed one half of the irrigable area for agricultural purposes, and has also paid his proportionate share of the cost of the irrigation system in instalments,-the last of which may not mature for ten years after entry.\n There are, possibly, other provisions to meet the special conditions of lands constituting an irrigation plant. But except as modified by the specific terms of the reclamation act, such lands are distinctly made subject to entry under the provisions of the homestead law, and all of the homesteaders' rights therein are the same as if the settlement had been located outside of the limits of irrigation works. One of the privileges, not affected by the reclamation act, is that which permits the homesteader, without patent, but in lawful possession, to grant to a railroad company a right of way across his claim; and whatever reason there was for conferring this right upon those who entered land in a sparsely settled section is doubly operative as to land located within the more thickly populated reclamation areas. Manifestly this is true as to so much as may be needed for churches and schoolhouses. It is equally so as to rights of way for railroads and other public utilities needed by the numerous residents living within the irrigation areas.\n An act passed since the reclamation act of 1902 serves, if possible, to make clearer the fact that Congress did not intend to deprive settlers on these or any other class of lands from granting railroad rights of way. For on March 3, 1905 (33 Stat. at L. 991, chap. 1424, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 592), after the establishment of the Minidoka project, Congress amended Rev. Stat.  2288, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1385, so as to provide that 'any bona fide settler under the pre-emption, homestead, or other settlement law, shall have the right to transfer by warranty against his own acts, any portion of his claim for church, cemetery, or school purposes, or for the right of way of railroads, telegraph, telephone, canals, reservoirs, or ditches. . . .' These \n\n[235 U.S. 211, 219]\n\u00a0\n privileges were renewed and extended by this act because of the public benefits to be derived from such utilities. When, therefore, the Minidoka & Southwestern Railroad Company, in 1909, secured grants to the continuous strip through the reclamation area, the company, by virtue of these public statutes and the private grants, was authorized to construct its road not only across the agricultural lands, but over the intervening ditches and canals. For, while the latter formed a part of the irrigation unit, they were also particularly appurtenant to the lands through and along which they ran.\n These various acts of Congress operated to give its consent, in advance, to the construction of such a highway and instrumentality of commerce, notwithstanding any interest the United States may have had in the lands described in the deeds from the homesteaders to the railroad company.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the Circuit Court for the District of Idaho is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","136":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI PAC.

TePoel for appellee.\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 121, 126]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit was originally instituted in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Nebraska. Its object was to enjoin the city of Omaha from requiring the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, by virtue of a certain ordinance of the city, to construct a viaduct over and across its line of railway and along Dodge street, in said city. The circuit court dismissed the bill and the decree was affirmed in the circuit court of appeals. 117 C. C. A. 12, 197 Fed. 516. The ordinance, passed March 29, 1910, ordered the appellant to erect, construct, and complete the viaduct and approaches on Dodge street, of the width, height, strength, and of the material and manner of construction required by the city engineer of the city of Omaha, and according to the plans and specifications prepared by him. The ordinance required that the company commence the erection and construction of the viaduct by May 1st, 1910, and complete the same on or before January 1, 1911\n\n\n Dodge street is a well-known thoroughfare of the city for the passage of foot passengers and vehicles of all sorts, and it is also used by the tracks of a street railway company. There is testimony in the record tending to show that the viaduct, as ordered to be constructed, is of a width and strength sufficient to sustain the street railway system theretofore laid upon Dodge street, and crossing thereon the tracks of the railway company. It is con- \n\n[235 U.S. 121, 127]\n\u00a0\n tended, and there is testimony tending to show, that a viaduct sufficient to carry the ordinary traffic of the street, other than that of the street railroad, could be constructed at a cost of about $30,000, whereas the viaduct ordered to be built would cost approximately $80,000, the increase being largely due to the requirements of the street railway traffic. This requirement on the part of the city is alleged to be a confiscation of the property of the railroad company to the extent of this increased cost, and a taking of its property without compensation for the benefit of another, and therefore without due process of law, contrary to the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n That a railway company may be required by the state, or by a duly authorized municipality acting under its authority, to construct overhead crossings or viaducts at its own expense, and that the consequent cost to the company as a matter of law is damnum absque injuria, or deemed to be compensated by the public benefit which the company is supposed to share, is well settled by prior adjudications of this court.

Rep. 400.\n This is done in the exercise of the police power, and the means to be employed to promote the public safety are primarily in the judgment of the legislative branch of the government, to whose authority such matters are committed, and so long as the means have a substantial relation to the purpose to be accomplished, and there is no arbitrary interference with private rights, the courts cannot interfere with the exercise of the power by enjoining regulations made in the interest of public safety which the legislature has duly enacted. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. \n\n[235 U.S. 121, 128]\n\u00a0\n v. Illinois, \n200 U.S. 561\n, 50 L. ed. 596, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 341, 4 Ann. Cas. 1175; McLean v.

That the city of Omaha had power to pass an ordinance of this character in execution of the authority conferred upon it by the legislature of the state has been determined by the highest court of the state of Nebraska, considering chapter 12a,  128, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1911.1 State ex rel. Omaha v. Union P. R. Co. 94 Neb. 556, 143 N. W. 918. In that case the state supreme court declares the 'power to require railway companies to construct upon their tracks at street cross- \n\n[235 U.S. 121, 129]\n\u00a0\n ings such viaducts 'as may be deemed and declared by the mayor and council necessary for the safety and protection of the public, is in direct terms conferred by the legislature upon the city of Omaha.' As this is a question of state law (Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Goldsboro, \n232 U.S. 548\n, 58 L. ed. 721, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 364) we need not dwell upon it further. Indeed, such authority seems to be admitted in the brief of appellant, and the argument is addressed to an alleged abuse of the power conferred. To maintain this position, it is first insisted that the construction of the viaduct in such manner as to carry the tracks of the street railway company will entail additional expense of about $50,000, over the cost of a viaduct providing only for the transportation of other kinds of traffic. It may be that it would be more fair and equitable to require the street railway company to share in the expense of the viaduct, and if the municipality had been authorized so to do by competent authority, it would have been a constitutional exercise of the police power to have made such division of expenses. Detroit, Ft. W. & B. I. R. Co. v. Osborn, \n189 \nU.S. 383, 389\n, 47 S. L. ed. 860, 864, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 540. But there is nothing in the statute requiring the municipality to divide the expense of such improvement among those responsible for the dangerous condition of the street crossing. Where a number of railroads have contributed to the condition which necessitates such improvement in the interest of public safety, it is not an unconstitutional exercise of authority, as this court has held, to require one of the companies interested to perform such work at its own expense. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Nebraska, \n170 \nU.S. 57, 76\n, 42 S. L. ed. 948, 954, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 513. The broad authority to require any railroad company to make such improvement, in the interest of public safety, is conferred by the legislature upon the city. The safety of the traveling public is the primary consideration, and this is accomplished by the construction of the viaduct which is used by many people who travel across the viaduct every day. The public, when being \n\n[235 U.S. 121, 130]\n\u00a0\n transported by the street railway company, was exposed to the dangers of a grade crossing, which it was within the authority of the state to authorize the municipality to discontinue. Under competent legislation the city has undertaken to do this. In placing the expense entirely upon the railroad company, whose locomotives and trains are principally responsible for the resulting danger to the public, we do not find such abuse of the recognized authority of the state as has justified the courts in some cases in enjoining the enforcement of state and municipal legislation. Examples of such arbitrary and oppressive action with which the courts may interfere are found in such cases as Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 U.S. 356\n, 30 L. ed. 220, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1064, and Dobbins v. Los Angeles, \n195 U.S. 223\n, 49 L. ed. 169, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 18.\n The Constitution of the United States, requiring that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, has not undertaken to equalize all the inequalities which may result from the exercise of recognized state authority. In the exercise of the police power, it may happen, as it often does, that inequality results which the law is powerless to redress. It is only in those clear and unmistakable cases of abuse of legislative authority that the court is authorized, under section of the Federal Constitution, to enjoin the exercise of legislative power. As we have said, we do not think this case presents that character of abuse because the street railway company is not required to share in the expense of the erection of this viaduct.\n It is next urged that there is an abuse of authority shown which should justify an injunction against the enforcement of this ordinance, because a viaduct about 600 feet long would be sufficient to carry the traffic of Dodge street over the railroad crossing, including the traffic of the street railway company, yet by this ordinance it is sought to compel the railroad company to construct a viaduct 810 feet long, the extension being made neces- \n\n[235 U.S. 121, 131]\n\u00a0\n sary, it is said, for the purpose of carrying the Dodge street traffic, including that of the street railway company, over a proposed boulevard, which the city might thereafter decide to lay out and establish across Dodge street, which boulevard is alleged to be about 350 feet east of, and parallel to, the line of the railroad. But there is testimony in the record tending to show that this extension of the original plan of the viaduct was for the purpose of making better grades in crossing thereon, and both courts below have rejected the contention of the railroad company that it was intended thereby to make a crossing for a proposed boulevard thereafter to be laid out. We are not prepared to disturb this conclusion of two courts upon the facts.\n It is next insisted that the ordinance in question is unconstitutional and void, because the railroad company is required to construct a viaduct along the south side of Dodge street only, leaving some portion of the street-that upon the north side-still open to public traffic; in other words, the argument is that the viaduct would be made to carry a part of the traffic, still leaving some portion of the street open. We are unable to find force in this contention. The necessity of the viaduct, and the manner of its construction, were primarily vested in the discretion of the city authorities, and that they have found cause to leave some part of the street still open to traffic does not afford any reason why the principal part of the traffic, including that of the street railway company, might not, in the interest of the public safety, be required to be carried by the overhead structure. The local authorities are presumed to have knowledge of local conditions, and to have been induced by competent reasons to take the action which they did. That the city had authority to require a viaduct to be constructed over tracks without entirely closing the street was held by the supreme court of Nebraska. State ex rel. Omaha v. Union P. R. Co. 94 Neb. supra. \n\n[235 U.S. 121, 132]\n\u00a0\n It is further contended the ordinance is void for uncertainty, and that the plans are confused and uncertain, and not sufficient to indicate the width, height, and manner of construction of the proposed viaduct, and that the plans and specifications existing are not capable of being followed in such manner as to comply with the ordinance. This contention was also rejected by the courts below upon the facts shown, and we are not prepared to disturb the conclusion that the plans and specifications were sufficient to enable the railroad company to know what it had to do, and to make the structure required of it.\n The last objection is that the railroad company was required to begin construction within twenty-six days after the passing of the ordinance,-a time so short as to render it physically impossible to comply with the ordinance, and that upon lack of such compliance, the ordinance imposes penalties upon the railroad company, the collection of which penalties it is also sought to enjoin. It is to be noted that the enforcement of this ordinance has been entirely prevented by the injunction issued in this case, and kept in force since, and we have no doubt that should an attempt be made hereafter to require compliance with the terms of the ordinance as to the beginning of construction, they would be given a reasonable interpretation so as to permit of preparation before the beginning of the work, and if any oppression should result in this respect, there is no doubt as to the power of a court of equity to relieve the railroad company from the infliction of unwarranted penalties if it should turn out to be physically impossible, as the company insists, to comply with the ordinance in this respect.\n We find no error in the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming the decree of the Circuit Court, and it is accordingly affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] To require any railway company or companies owning or operating any railway track or tracks upon or across any public street or streets of the city, to erect, construct, reconstruct, complete, and keep in repair any viaduct or viaducts upon or along such street or streets and over or under such track or tracks, including the approaches of such viaduct or viaducts as may be deemed and declared by the mayor and council necessary for the safety and protection of the public. . . .

R. CO. v. LARABEE(1914)\nNo. 135\nArgued: Decided: June 22, 1914\n\n\n\n A dispute as to a small charge for demurrage having arisen between the Missouri Pacific Railway Company and \n\n[234 U.S. 459, 460]\n\u00a0\n the Larabee Fiour Mills Company, the railway company, to enforce payment, suspended the rendering of a certain class of switching service which it had previously regularly performed for the mills company. The latter, on September 15th, 1906, commenced in the supreme court of Kansas mandamus proceedings to compel the continuance of the service. After a response to an alternative rule and a hearing on the 8th of December, 1906, the court granted a peremptory mandamus. 74 Kan. 808, 88 Pac. 72. At the close of the opinion there was the following memorandum:\n'The court has authority to render judgment in favor of the plaintiff for any damage it has sustained. Gen. Stat. 1901,  5193. The plaintiff is given ten days in which to file a claim for damages, stating separately the character and amount of each item. The defendant is given ten days after notice of the filing of the claim in which to except to any items which it may deem not recoverable. The court will then pass upon the exceptions if any be taken, and make orders respecting a hearing.'\n\n Some days thereafter a claim of damages was filed enumerating fifteen items. The first eight concerned various business losses alleged to have been occasioned by the suspension of the service, such as decrease in the output of the mill, increased cost of hauling, etc., etc. Four of the claims on these subjects aggregated $4,907.39, and four stated no amount, but reserved the right to make a future claim for losses in case the litigation should be prolonged and the resumption of the service postponed. The remaining six items, with one execption, related to small expenses alleged to have been incurred in the mandamus suit. One of them, however, the fourteenth, made a charge of $2,500 'to cash paid and plaintiff's agreement to pay Waters & Waters attorneys' fees in this case.' The fifteenth item reserved the right to make a charge for future \n\n[234 U.S. 459, 461]\n\u00a0\n legal services 'if this case is taken to the Supreme Court of the United States whatever such services may be worth.' A few days after this claim was filed, on December 24th, 1906, a writ of error was issued from this court to the judgment in mandamus, and a bond to operate as a supersedeas was approved. About two years thereafter, on January 11th, 1909, the case was decided in this court and the judgment below was affirmed. \n211 U.S. 612\n, 53 L. ed. 352, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 214.\n After the mandate went down, leave was given to file an amended claim for damages, and on the same day a commissioner was appointed to hear the testimony concerning it and report. The amended claim was filed. It was divided into three general classes: first, damages asserted to have arisen from loss of business, etc.; second, damages claimed as the result of the expenses and outlay for the suit; third, cost incurred or anticipated, occasioned by the hearing of the claim. The first, that is, the business losses, was embraced in separate items substantially following the order of the original claim; that is, it was based on alleged loss of output, increased cost of operation, etc., etc. The amounts of many of these items were larger, as they covered the time from the discontinuance of the service up to the filing of the amended claim. The aggregate of the claim was $18,921.90, as compared with $4,907.39, made at the time of the first claim. The second, the expenses of the suit, was greatly changed. Leaving out two insignificant items, as amended the claim was in substance follows.\n The claim for $2,500 paid or to be paid to Waters & Waters for personal services was changed to read, 'For the reasonable value of the services of Waters & Waters to bring this action and to attend to the same in the supreme court of the state of Kansas, the sum of $ 2,500.00 \n\n[234 U.S. 459, 462]\n\u00a0\n 'Tenth. For the reasonable value of the services of Waters & Waters in this case in the Supreme Court of the United States, the sum of 40,000.00 'Eleventh. For cash paid out for printed briefs in the state and United States Supreme Court, the sum of 93.50 'Twelfth. For the reasonable value of the professional services of John F. Switzer, attorney at law, employed to assist Waters & Waters in the Supreme Court of the United States, the plaintiff, in the best judgment of the partners composing said firm, deeming it necessary, after considering the momentous and far-reaching controversy made, urged, and argued in the Supreme Court of the United States, and which controversy it could not avoid, the sum of 3,000.00 'Thirteenth. For the reasonable value of the professional services of the firm of Rossington & Smith, attorneys at law, also employed to present the case of the plaintiff in the Supreme Court of the United States, the plaintiff, in the best judgment of the partners composing said firm, deeming it necessary, after considering the momentous and far-reaching controversy made, urged, and contended for in the Supreme Court of the United States, and which controversy it could not avoid, the sum of 30,000.00 'Fourteenth. For the railroad fare, hotel bills, and reasonable expenses of W. H. Rossington and J. G. Waters in attending on the United States Supreme Court in April, 1908, the sum of $250 each, and making a total of 500.00 \n\n[234 U.S. 459, 463]\n\u00a0\n 'Fifteenth. For the railroad fare, hotel bills, and reasonable expenses of Charles Blood Smith and J. G. Waters in attending on the Supreme Court in October, 1908, the sum of 480.60 'Sixteenth. For the costs due the plaintiff in the Supreme Court of the United States, the sum of 148.25\"\n The 17th, 18th, and 19th items embraced small items of traveling and other expenses of the parties and some of their attorneys. In the items of court expenses the difference between the original claim was substantially this: that the claim had grown from about $2,800 for attorneys' fees in the state court when the original claim in damages was filed to a sum in excess of $75,000, all of which increase resulted from charges made for professional services rendered in this court in connection with the trial of the case. The remaining items of the third class related to expenses incurred under the reference to the commissioner before whom the case was pending, with a reservation of the right to make future charges for such purpose when the reference was completed.\n The railway company objected to the various items in the amended claim as follows: To those covering the business losses, decrease of output, increased expenses, etc., etc., besides denying that the suit was the proximate cause of the losses represented by the alleged claims, and asserting their speculative nature, it was specially charged that in so far as they included items arising after the allowance of the writ of error from this court and the giving of the supersedeas bond, they were not within the cognizance of the court, but were matters alone of Federal competency within the jurisdiction of this court. So far as the claims for alleged outlay and expenses including attorneys' fees in the state court were concerned, it was alleged that there was no right to recover them because \n\n[234 U.S. 459, 464]\n\u00a0\n the only authority under which they could be allowed was a statute of the state of Kansas relating to mandamus proceedings, and that such statute, as construed by the court of last resort of the state, was repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment because, under such construction, a right was given by the statute to a plaintiff in mandamus to recover attorneys' fees as damages, while no reciprocal right in case of success was given to a defendant, and no such right was given to litigants generally. Coming to the alleged right to recover attorneys' fees for services rendered on the writ of error in this court and the other items, such as briefs, traveling expenses, hotel bills, etc., etc., it was expressly charged that under the statutes of the United States the effect of the writ of error from this court and the supersedeas was to deprive the state court of all authority over such expenses, and that, moreover, 'under such statutes and laws of the United States, this court has no power, authority, or jurisdiction to consider the claim and demand for damages on account of attorneys' fees for services rendered in such proceeding in error from the Supreme Court of the United States to the supreme court of Kansas; and for the further reason that, if the said plaintiffs were entitled to any damages, their application therefor should be made to the Supreme Court of the United States, or in an independent proceeding brought on the supersedeas bond so approved and allowed as a supersedeas by the chief justice of this state . . . and because, further, to allow such claim would be violative of the Constitution of the United States, and especially the 14th Amendment thereof, which prohibits any state from denying to any person, company, or corporation the equal protection of the laws, and prevents any state from depriving any person, company, or corporation of its property without due process of law; . . . and because of such judiciary act (of the United States) . . ., this court \n\n[234 U.S. 459, 465]\n\u00a0\n is deprived of all jurisdiction to consider or determine any such question or element of damage in a proceeding of this kind; and because, further, the Supreme Court of the United States, in affirming the judgment of this court . . . allowed to said plaintiffs, on account of attorneys' fees, the sum of $20, and assessed the same against the said defendant. . . .'\n After proof and hearing the commissioner made an elaborate report stating fully what he conceived to be the facts and the law of the case. On the subject of the various claims made for the allowance of damages for a charge of fees for professional services rendered in the Supreme Court of the United States, the commissioner made the following statement:\n'I find that no agreement has ever been had between the mill company and any of the attorneys as to the amount of their compensation; that neither of the attorneys has at any time entered on his books a charge against the mill company for services rendered; nor have they informed the mill company of the amount intended to be charged; nor have they determined in their own minds any definite amount intended to be charged.\n\n'I find that the attorneys will claim the full amount, and will accept whatever amount that shall be determined by this court in this proceeding to be a reasonable compensation for their services in the case and allowed as part of the damages.\n\n'I further find that it is mutually understood between the mill company and the attorneys named, that whatever amount is recovered in this proceeding on account of fees and expenses of counsel will be paid by the mill company to and accepted by the attorneys as a full discharge of the liability to them.'\n\n The conclusions of the commissioner as to the amounts to be allowed as damages under the three classes of claims were as follows: \n\n[234 U.S. 459, 466]\n\u00a0\n\n As to the first class, he reduced the claim for business losses, increased expenses, etc., etc., from $18,921.90 to $ 5,658.10 As to the amount claimed as due because of the professional services of Waters & Waters in the state court, the sum claimed was allowed in full 2,500.00 As to the items for professional services rendered in the Supreme Court of the United States, including hotel bill, etc., the amount was reduced from about $75,000 to 11,480.00 Under the third class three small items were allowed relating to the expenses of the parties in Kansas, and concerning the reference to the commissioner 376.00 ___\n Total $20,014.10\n Both parties excepted to the report of the commissioner on various grounds, and after a hearing the supreme court sustained his action and affirmed his report. 85 Kan. 214, 116 Pac. 901.\n Mr. Balie P. Waggener for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Charles Blood Smith, Joseph G. Waters, John C. Waters, and john F. Switzer for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Chief Justice White:\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Both before the commissioner and to the court where the report of the commissioner was acted on the propositions under the Constitution and laws of the United States upon which the railway company relied were pressed and overruled and the rightfulness of having so done is the \n\n[234 U.S. 459, 467]\n\u00a0\n question here for decision. But first we notice a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. It is difficult to grasp the ground upon which it rests. In one aspect it would seem to assert that there is no jurisdiction because the Federal rights which were passed upon below were correctly decided. But this obviously goes to the merits. In the only other possible aspect it would seem that the motion proceeds upon the theory that the Federal rights which were decided below were so obviously rightly decided that the contention of error concerning them is too frivolous to sustain jurisdiction,-a view which is supported by a statement in the argument for the motion that of course there would be jurisdiction if it appeared that the judgment below 'under the color and sanctity of the law inflicted exceptional and unjust exactions.' But taking the most favorable view for the motion, and assuming that it proceeds upon the only ground upon which it can possibly be said to rest, that is, the frivolousness of the errors relied upon, we pass from its consideration, since upon such hypothesis we think, on the face of the record, the contention is so clearly unsound as to require no further notice.\n The Federal errors relied upon concern three subjects: The allowance of business losses, etc.; the award of a sum for attorneys' fees in the state court up to and including the writ of error from this court and the supersedeas; and the grant of an amount for attorneys' fees agreed or supposedly agreed to be paid for professional services rendered in this court on the writ of error, and traveling expenses and hotel bills allowed for the same purpose. The three involve different considerations, and hence we consider them separately. We come first to test the question as to attorneys' fees in this court, as it is the most important and far- reaching, since it involves considerations of the gravest importance going to the entire structure of our system of government, based as it is upon an absolute \n\n[234 U.S. 459, 468]\n\u00a0\n denial of any power whatever in the court below to deal with the subject, while the other two contentions at best challenge power but relatively or partially.\n First. The question of the power of the court to make the allowance for professional services rendered in this court on the former writ of error.\n There can be no doubt that, tested by the general principles of law controlling in this court, by the statutes of the United States relating to the subject, or the rules of this court concerning the same, the award for the attorneys' fees in question was absolutely unwarranted. We do not stop to review and expound the settled line of authority demonstrating this result because it would be wholly superfluous to do so, as the principles have been so long the settled rule of conduct in this court, and are so elementary as to require not even a reference to the cases. Some of the cases, nevertheless, we cite: Arcambel v. Wiseman, 3 Dall. 306, 1 L. ed. 613; Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 372, 14 L. ed. 181, 185; Oelrichs v. Spain (Oelrichs v. Williams) 15 Wall. 211, 230, 231, 21 L. ed. 43, 45; Tullock v. Mulvane, \n184 U.S. 497\n, 511, et seq., 46 L. ed. 657, 665, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 372. Indeed, this view is not disputed in the argument at bar, and was not questioned in the court below, since the court placed its action in making the allowances in question, not upon the supposed authority of any act of Congress, nor of any practice of this court or rule thereof sustaining the same, nor upon any principle of general law, but solely upon the theory that a state statute gave the power to make the allowances. Nothing could make this view clearer than does the following statement, taken from the opinion of the court below: 'The damages in mandamus proceedings comprehended by  723 of the Code [ Gen. Stat. 1909,  6319] are the injuries sustained as the natural and probable consequences of the wrongful refusal to comply and the expense reasonably and necessarily incurred in compelling compliance with the alternative writ, including reasonable attorneys' fees in this court and in the Supreme \n\n[234 U.S. 459, 469]\n\u00a0\n Court of the United States.' And in addition the view of the court below is aptly illustrated by the following passage from the report of the commissioner answering the claim of the railway company as to the effect of the writ of error from this court and the giving of the supersedeas and the resulting authority of this court over the cause under the statutes of the United States,-a passage which the court below expressly adopted and made a part of its opinion:\n'Upon this objection I conclude:\n\n'1. That the jurisdiction of this court in mandamus is the creation of the Constitution and the statutes of the state of Kansas.\n\n'2. That this court is the sole judge of what that Constitution and those statutes provide.\n\n'3. That the jurisdiction of this court in mandamus over persons within its jurisdiction cannot be affected by act of Congress.\n\n'4. That the judiciary act does not and was not intended to affect the jurisdiction of this court.\n\n'5. That the jurisdiction of this court in mandamus attaches upon the issuance of the althernative writ, and the subjectmatter of the proceeding being the awarding a peremptory mandamus, that jurisdiction continues unabated, not only until the writ is awarded, but also until the writ is issued and obedience to it enforced.\n\n'6. That the alternative writ is a command of the performance of specified and prescribed duties; and return to the writ is a refusal to perform the duties prescribed; the judgment awarding a peremptory mandamus is a conclusive adjudication that such refusal was wrongful, and the act of the court compelling compliance with the command of the alternative writ.\n\n'7. That the damages comprehended by the Kansas statute are the injuries sustained as the natural and probable consequences of the wrongful refusal to comply, \n\n[234 U.S. 459, 470]\n\u00a0\n and the expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred in compelling compliance with the command of the alternative writ.\n\n'8. That the allowance of the writ of error did not operate to remove the suit from the supreme court of the state into the Supreme Court of the United States; its only effect was to bring up the record for purposes of review.\n\n'9. The allwance of the writ of error did not operate as a supersedeas; the taking the supersedeas bond brought about the supersedeas. The taking the bond, and the supersedeas itself, in so far as it can be conceived of as a substantial act, was the action of the supreme court of Kansas.'\n\n We observe in passing, that the views concerning the judiciary act and the effect of the writ of error from this court and the relevant statutes of the United States which were expounded in this passage are not required to be reviewed because they are not necessarily involved in the decision below, since that decision did not rest upon them, but was based upon the operative effect of the state statute, and hence the views expressed as to the United States statutes in the passage quoted must have been adopted simply because they were considered to be illustrative of the principle by which the state statute was made to control. We, therefore, without in the slightest degree admitting their correctness even for argument's sake, pass the conclusions as to the statutes of the United States, expressed in the passages of the report, and shall not recur to them except in so far as, under the principle of noscitur a sociis, we may find it convenient to do so as illustrating the fundamental and destructive error embodied in the conclusion of the court as to the operative power of the state statute.\n The question is, then, Was the court below right in holding that it had the power, because the Kansas statute so authorized, to assess as against one party to a suit in the \n\n[234 U.S. 459, 471]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court of the United States a sum for attorneys' fees for services rendered in that court as against another party to the suit, although such assessment, as we have seen, was not authorized by the law of the United States, but was in conflict with the settled rule in the Supreme Court of the United States? It seems superfluous to put the question, since its very statement conveys of necessity a negative answer. For how, on the face of the question, consistently with the most elementary principles of our constitutional system of government can it be possibly assumed that a state statute could be made operative in the Supreme Court of the United States to the disregard of its settled rule of procedure and of the principles which had guided its conduct from the beginning, directly sustained by express rule adopted under the sanction of Congress?\n We might well go no further, but in view of the importance of the subject we briefly advert to one or more of the obvious consequences which would arise from maintaining the principle. It would follow, of course, that the right to freely seek access to the Supreme Court of the United States would cease to exist, since it would be in the power of the states to burden that right to such a degree as to render its exercise impossible. How better could this be illustrated than by the case before us; that is, by the necessary implication that there would have been power in the court below if it had deemed it just to do so, to award the claim which was made for $75,000 attorneys' fees for services rendered in this court! Indeed, in the argument at bar it was freely conceded that it may well have been that the mainspring which caused the adoption of the statute relied upon was the deterrent influence which it would produce in the prosecution of writs of error to this court. Thus the argument proceeds: 'The railway company refuses to obey; judgment is had against it; it still refuses, it seeks delay; it initiates \n\n[234 U.S. 459, 472]\n\u00a0\n a writ of error in this court. By this method it makes the suit expensive . . . It was just this situation that the legislature of Kansas intended to correct. . . .'\n And the far-reaching operation of the principle by which the state statute could alone have been made to produce the result attributed to it by the court below is illustrated by the legal conclusions of the operation and effect of the statutes of the United States stated in the report of the commissioner, which was adopted by the court as expressed in the passage which we have previously quoted. This is the case, since the views thus sanctioned are necessarily illustrative of the mental atmosphere by which alone it could have been possible to conceive that the state power extended to regulate the proceedings in the Supreme Court of the United States to the disregard of the express provisions of the act of Congress. A view which is not an overstatement when it is observed that, among other things, the conclusion which was below sustained was that the writ of error from this court and the supersedeas authorized by the act of Congress were not Federal but purely state acts. And, moreover, it was concluded that the exertion by the Supreme Court of the United States under the Constitution and laws of the United States of the power to bring up a case from the state court in order to review it and to grant a supersedeas in order to make that right effective, operated to leave the state court in possession of the case and only to move the record, hence creating a residuum of state power which, as to such case, gave authority to the state court to regulate, certainly as to attorneys' fees, the proceedings in the Supreme Court of the United States.\n We shall reason no further, and shall content ourselves with pointing out that in substance and effect the absolute want of foundation for the contention here made has been in express terms foreclosed. For instance, at this term in Harrison v. St. Louis & S. F. R. Co. \n\n[234 U.S. 459, 473]\n\u00a0\n \n232 U.S. 318\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 333, a statute of the state of Oklahoma which burdened or impeded the right of free access to the courts of the United States was held to be repugnant to the Constitution, and the destructive effect of such legislation upon our institutions was pointed out. And light on the subject is afforded by a consideration of the ruling in Tullock v. Mulvane, \n184 U.S. 497\n, 46 L. ed. 657, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 372. See also Home Ins. Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall. 445, 453, 22 L. ed. 365, 368; Clark v. Bever, \n139 \nU.S. 96, 102\n, 103 S., 35 L. ed. 88, 91, 92, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 468. Second. The power of the court below to award damages for the business losses which were suffered after the allowance of the writ of error and the supersedeas.\n The contention is that the power did not exist since the effect of the writ of error and the supersedeas was to remove the case to this court, and therefore deprive the court below of the right to consider any act causing damage done after the prosecution of the writ of error and the supersedeas. But, conceding in the fullest degree the asserted effect of the supersedeas, that effect ceased with the affirmance of the judgment by this court, and therefore necessarily opened the way for the court below to consider and determine how far the alleged illegal conduct of the railway company had entailed damages and consequent responsibility. Conceding further that the bond for supersedeas embraced such acts and the resulting damages therefrom, and therefore there was a right to sue on the bond, again the deduction is a non sequitur because the right to resort to the bond did not imply an exclusion of the right to sue under the general law to recover damages if the election was made to follow that course. Of course, as there is nothing in this case even suggesting that the award of damages for acts done pending the writ of error in this court was so excessive as to justify the extreme inference that punishment for invoking the right to resort to this court was inflicted, we need not consider the rule which would be applicable in such a contingency. \n\n[234 U.S. 459, 474]\n\u00a0\n Third. The power of the court below to award damages for attorneys' fees for services rendered in the state court.\n The attorneys' fees were allowed by the court below in virtue of a statute which gave such power in case of mandamus proceedings. The construction of this statute which was adopted was not original in this case, but was an application of an interpretation of the statute previously affixed to it, and, indeed, which was made prior to the commencement of the mandamus proceedings in question. Carney v. Neeley, 60 Kan. 672, 57 Pac. 527; McClure v. Scates, 64 Kan. 284, 67 Pac. 856. The contention is that as the statute exceptionally allows attorneys' fees in mandamus proceedings against one refusing to obey the peremptory writ of mandamus, and does not allow them in other cases, it contravenes the equal protection of the laws clause of the 14th Amendment and is void. But it is not open to controversy that the 14th Amendment was not intended to deprive the states of their power to establish and regulate judicial proceedings, and that its provisions therefore only restrain acts which so transcend the limits of classification as to cause them to conflict with the fundamental conceptions of just and equal legislation. The proposition here relied upon therefore comes to this: that there is not such a distinction between the extraordinary proceeding by mandamus and the ordinary judicial proceedings as affords a ground for legislating differently concerning the two. But when thus reduced to its ultimate basis, the proposition answers itself, since it cannot be formulated without demonstrating its own unsoundness. If more were needed to be said, it would suffice to direct attention to the distinction which must obtain between that which is ordinary and usual and that which is extraordinary and unusual. Or, to state it otherwise, to call attention to the difference between the duty to perform a ministerial act concerning which there is room neither for the exercise of judgment nor discretion, \n\n[234 U.S. 459, 475]\n\u00a0\n and the right, on the other hand, to bring into play judgment and discretion as prerequisites to the performance of an act of a different character, and the distinction which justifies the classification made by the statute also answers the argument that the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment is violated because the allowance of attorneys' fees was not reciprocal. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Cade, \n233 U.S. 642\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 678. The ruling in the case last cited also serves to demonstrate the want of merit in the contention that the question here presented is governed by Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 U.S. 150\n, 41 L. ed. 666, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 255.\n Again, we deem it necessary to observe that the opinion here expressed is confined to the case before us. We do not therefore imply that the reasoning here applied would be controlling in a case where, although the name 'mandamus' was preserved, in substance and effect the distinction between that writ in an accurate sense and ordinary procedure would have disappeared.\n It follows from what we have said that error was committed in the court below in allowing the items of damages for attorneys' fees, traveling expenses, etc., in the Supreme Court of the United States, and that from a Federal point of view there was no error in the judgment below to the extent that it awarded the damages complained and allowed a claim for attorneys' fees for services rendered in the state court. And to give effect to these conclusions the judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI, K & T R. CO. OF TEXAS v. CADE(1914)\nNo. 522\nArgued: Decided: May 11, 1914\n\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 642, 643]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joseph M. Bryson, Aldis B. Browne, Alexander S. Coke, and A. H. McKnight for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 642, 645]\n\u00a0\n No appearance for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was brought in the justice court to recover the sum of $ 10.75 alleged to be due as wages from the defendant (now plaintiff in error) to the plaintiff below, with an attorney's fee of $9. The fee was claimed only by virtue of an act of the legislature, approved March 19, 1909, Laws, p. 93, now forming arts. 2178 and 2179, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. 1911. Defendant specially excepted to this part of plaintiff's claim, on the ground that the act was invalid as constituting a burden upon interstate commerce, contrary to the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution and the act to regulate commerce and amendments thereof, and as violating the 'equal protection' and 'due process' clauses of the 14th Amendment. Notwithstanding these contentions, judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff for the amount claimed, including the attorney's fee. Under the local practice, no appeal lies from a decision of the justice court to a higher state court in a case involving less than $20, and so the judgment is brought directly here by writ of error for a review of the Federal questions.\n The statute in question (including its caption) is set \n\n[233 U.S. 642, 646]\n\u00a0\n forth in the margin. This is the same act that was held invalid under the state Constitution by the court of civil appeals in Ft. Worth & D. C. R. Co. v. Loyd, -- Tex. Civ. App. --, 132 S. W. 899, because of which decision this court, in Gulf, C.\n'An Act to Regulate the Presentation and Collection of Claims for Personal Servces or for Labor Rendered or for Material Furnished, or for Overcharges in Freight or Express, or for Any Claim for Lost or Damaged Freight, or for Stock Killed or Injured by Any Person or Corporation, against Any Person or Corporation Doing Business in This State, and Providing a Reasonable Amount of Attorney's Fees to be Recovered, in Cases Where the Amount of Such Claims Shall Not Exceed Two Hundred ($200) Dollars, and Declaring an Emergency.\n\n'Section 1. That hereafter any person in this state, having a valid, bona fide claim against any person or corporation doing business in this state, for personal services rendered, or for labor done, or for material furnished, or for overcharges on freight or express, or for any claim for lost or damaged freight, or for stock killed or injured by such person or corporation, its agents or employees, may present the same to such person or corporation, or to any duly authorized agent thereof, in any county where suit may be instituted for the same; and if, at the expiration of thirty days after the presentation of such claim, the same has not been paid or satisfied, he may immediately institute suit thereon in the proper court and if he shall finally establish his claim, and obtain judgment for the full amount thereof, as presented for payment to such person or corporation in such court, he shall be entitled to recover the amount of such claim and all costs of suit, and in addition thereto a reasonable amount as attorney's fees, provided he has an attorney employed in the case, not to exceed twenty ($20) dollars, to be determined by the court or jury trying the case; provided, however, that nothing in this act shall be construed to repeal or in any manner affect any provision of the law now in force giving a remedy to persons having claims of the character mentioned in this act, but the same shall be considered as cumulative of all other remedies given to such a person or persons.\n\n'Sec. 2. The fact that there is no law now in force in this state providing an effectual remedy for persons having such claims as are mentioned in this act creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity requiring the suspension of the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three several days, and this act shall take effect from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.\n\n'Approved March 13, 1909.' \n\n[233 U.S. 642, 647]\n\u00a0\n & S. F. R. Co. v. Dennis, \n224 U.S. 503\n, 56 L. ed. 860, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 542, reversed a judgment that included an attorney's fee, without passing upon the question whether the act contravened the 14th Amendment. And see Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Thorn, \n227 U.S. 675\n, 57 L. ed. 699, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 327. Since that time the supreme court of Texas, overruling the decision in the Loyd Case, has upheld the act under the Texas Constitution, in Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Mahaffey, 105 Tex. 394, 150 S. W. 881. We must therefore now consider the Federal questions.\n\n But first, we should note the construction placed upon the act by the state court of last resort. Section 35 of article 3 of the Constitution of 1876 declares that no bill except appropriation bills shall contain more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title; 'but if any subject shall be embraced in an act, which shall not be expressed in the title, such act shall be void only as to so much thereof as shall not be so expressed.' In the case last mentioned (105 Tex. 394, 398), the court construed the act as limited in its operation to the purpose expressed in the title; that is, as relating only to the collection of claims not exceeding $200 in amount, and as conferring no right upon persons having claims exceeding that amount which did not exist independently of the act. In reaching this conclusion, the court said: 'Surely, the leigslature did not intend to limit attorney's fees to $20 in a case involving $1,000, and there is no apparent reason for allowing additional attorney's fees of $20 in a case involving so large an amount, but there is a sound reason for allowing and limiting the amount of fee on small claims. If the claim be $ 200 or less, and suit must be instituted, which makes an attorney necessary, it is a heavy tax on the claimant; therefore, if he present a just demand which is refused, the recovery of the full amount claimed shows that the demand of payment should have \n\n[233 U.S. 642, 648]\n\u00a0\n been granted, and this law compels one refusing payment of such demand to pay the cost and attorney's fees, not to exceed $20. The limitation of the amount of the fee to $20 and to cases in which an attorney has been actually employed practically implies that such action might be prosecuted without an attorney, which in effect limits the amount of the claim to $ 200 because the only court in which suits of that character could be instituted by nonprofessional claimants, without the services of an attorney, is that of justice of the peace, whose jurisdiction cannot exceed $200; therefore, the limitation in the caption is in effect the same as that of the body of the law, because the proviso in the law can be harmonized with the title by no other construction.'\n So far as the present attack is founded upon the commerce clause and the act to regulate commerce, it is sufficient to say that the judgment under review was not based upon a claim arising out of interstate commerce, and hence plaintiff in error does not bring itself within the class with regard to whom it claims the act to be in this respect repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States.

Rep. 359.\n Upon the other questions, plaintiff in error relies chiefly upon Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, \n165 U.S. 150\n, 41 L. ed. 666, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 255. In that case a previous act of the legislature of Texas (act of April 5, 1889, Laws p. 131; Supp. to Sayles's Tex. Civ. Stat. art. 4266a; p. 768) was held repugnant to the 14th Amendment. That act \n\n[233 U.S. 642, 649]\n\u00a0\n allowed the recovery of plaintiff's attorneys' fees in certain classes of cases, but only where the defendant was a railroad company, and it was adjudged to be invalid because it singled out a particular class of debtors, and imposed this burden upon them, without any reasonable ground existing for the discrimination. The classification was held to be arbitrary, because having no relation to the special privileges granted to this class of corporations, or to the peculiar features of their business, distinguishing Missouri P. R. Co. v. Humes, \n115 U.S. 512\n, 29 L. ed. 463, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1110\n\n\n The present statute, however, differs in essential features. It applies to claims 'against any person or corporation doing business in this state for personal services rendered or for labor done, or for material furnished, or for overcharges on freight or express, or for any claim for lost or damaged freight, or for stock killed or injured by such person or corporation, its agents or employees.' There is here no classification of debtors; the act bears equally against individuals and against corporations of any class doing business in the state. It applies only to certain kinds of claims; but these cover a wide range, and do not appear to have been grouped together for the purpose of bearing against any class or classes of citizens or corporations. Unless something of this sort did appear, we should not be justified in holding the act to be repugnant to the 14th Amendment. It is a police regulation designed to promote the prompt payment of small claims and to discourage unnecessary litigation in respect to them. The claims included appear to be such as are susceptible of being readily adjusted by the party responsible, within the thirty days that must intervene between the presentation of the claim and the institution of suit. We may imagine that some other kinds of claims might as well have been included; but it is to be presumed that the legislature was dealing with an actual mischief, and made the act as broad in its scope as seemed \n\n[233 U.S. 642, 650]\n\u00a0\n necessary from the practical standpoint. As has been said before, the 14th Amendment does not require that state laws shall be perfect; and we cannot judicially denounce this act as based upon arbitrary distinctions, in view of the wide discretion that must necessarily reside in a state legislature about resorting to classification when establishing regulations for the welfare of those for whom they legislate. Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Sav. Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 293\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1037, 1042, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 594; Orient Ins. Co. v. Daggs, \n172 \nU.S. 557, 562\n, 43 S. L. ed. 552, 554, 19 Sup. Ct.

L. ed. 369, 377, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160.\n It is insisted that the benefits of the act are conferred upon natural persons only; but this we cannot concede, in the absence of a decision by the courts of the state, giving to it a construction thus limited. Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 531, 546\n, 58 S. L. ed . --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 359. And besides, plaintiff in error is not in a position to assail the ligislation on the ground that corporation plaintiffs are not included within its benefits. Rosenthal v. New York, \n226 \nU.S. 260, 271\n, 57 S. L. ed. 212, 217, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 27.\n If the classification is otherwise reasonable, the mere fact that attorney's fees are allowed to successful plaintiffs only, and not to successful defendants, does not render the statute repugnant to the 'equal protection' clause. This is not a discrimination between different citizens or classes of citizens, since members of any and every class may either sue or be sued. Actor and reus differ in their respective attitudes towards a litigation; the former has the burden of seeking the proper jurisdiction and bringing the proper parties before it, as well as the burden of proof upon the main issues; and these differences may be made the basis of distinctive treatment respecting the allowance of an attorneys' fee as a part of the costs. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Matthews, \n174 U.S. 96\n, 43 L. ed. 909, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 609; Farmers' & M. Ins. Co. v. Dobney, \n189 \nU.S. 301, 304\n, 47 S. L. ed. 821, 825, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 565; McMullin v. Doughty, 68 N. J. Eq. 776, 781, 55 Atl. 115, 284, 64 Atl. 1134. \n\n[233 U.S. 642, 651]\n\u00a0\n Even were the statute to be considered as imposing a penalty upon unsuccessful defendants in cases within its sweep, such penalty is obviously imposed as an incentive to prompt settlement of small but well- founded claims, and as a deterrent of groundless defenses, which are the more oppressive where the amount involved is small. In Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Seegers, \n207 \nU.S. 73, 77\n, 52 S. L. ed. 108, 110, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 28, the court sustained a state enactment that imposed a fixed penalty of $50 upon common carriers, to be recovered by the party aggrieved, for failure to promptly adjust and pay claims for loss or damage to property while in the carrier's possession. In Yazoo & M. Valley R. Co. v. Jackson Vinegar Co. \n226 \nU.S. 217, 219\n, 57 S. L. ed. 193, 194, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 40, we upheld a state enactment that imposed a penalty of $25 in addition to actual damages for failure to settle claims for lost or damaged freight within a limited time after written notice of the loss. And in Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Anderson, decided April 13, 1914, \n233 U.S. 325\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 599, we upheld the imposition of double damages in cases admitting of special treatment.\n But we think it is not correct to consider this statute as imposing a penalty. The allowance is confined to a reasonable attorney's fee, not exceeding $20, where an attorney is actually employed; the amount to be determined by the court or jury trying the case. Manifestly, the purpose is merely to require the defendant to reimburse the plaintiff for a part of his expenses not otherwise recoverable as 'costs of suit.' So far as it goes, it imposes only compensatory damages upon a defendant who, in the judgment of the legislature, unreasonably delays and resists payment of a just demand. The outlay for an attorney's fee is a necessary consequence of the litigation, and since it must fall upon one party or the other, it is reasonable to impose it upon the party whose refusal to pay a just claim renders the litigation necessary. The allowance of ordinary costs of suit to the \n\n[233 U.S. 642, 652]\n\u00a0\n prevailing party rests upon the same principle. 2 Bacon, Abr. title Costs. Numerous cases in the state courts have sustained similar legislation. Vogel v. Pekoc, 157 Ill. 339, 344, 346, 30 L.R.A. 491, 42 N. E. 386; Burlington, C. R. & N. R. Co. v. Dey, 82 Iowa, 312, 340, 12 L.R.A. 436, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 584, 31 Am. St. Rep. 477, 48 N. W. 98; Cameron v. Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. 63 Minn. 384, 388, 31 L.R.A. 553, 65 N. W. 652; Wortman v. Kleinschmidt, 12 Mont. 316, 330, 30 Pac. 280. If a reasonable penalty may be imposed for failure to satisfy a demand found to be just, it follows a fortiori that costs and an attorney's fee may be. See Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Matthews, \n174 \nU.S. 96, 105\n, 43 S. L. ed. 909, 913, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 609; Farmers' & M. Ins. Co. v. Dobney, \n189 \nU.S. 301, 304\n, 47 S. L. ed. 821, 825, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 565.\n For these reasons, it seems to us that the statute in question is not repugnant to either the 'equal protection' or the 'due process' clauses of the 14th Amendment.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","139":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI, K & T R. CO. OF TEXAS v. HARRIS(1914)\nNo. 604\nArgued: Decided: June 8, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 412, 413]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joseph M. Bryson, Aldis B. Browne, Alexander S. Coke, and A. H. McKnight for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 412, 414]\n\u00a0\n No counsel appeared for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 412, 415]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n In this case the plaintiff below (now defendant in error) recovered a judgment for $3.50 damages for loss of certain freight that was shipped from St. Louis, Missouri, consigned to plaintiff at Como, Texas, and delivered by the initial carrier to defendant for transportation to destination; the loss having occurred on defendant's line in Texas. The judgment includes an attorney's fee of $10, allowed by virtue of the local statute approved March 19, 1909, Laws, p. 93, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. 1911, arts. 2178 and 2179, which was under consideration in Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Cade, decided May 11, 1914, \n233 U.S. 642\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 678, and is set forth verbatim in a marginal note to the opinion in that case. The controversy turns upon the allowance of the attorney's fee, the same Federal questions having been raised in the state court and in this court that were raised in the Cade Case. So far as the 14th Amendment is concerned, our opinion in that case renders further discussion unnecessary. But since the claim of the present plaintiff was based upon freight lost in interstate commerce, we must now pass upon the question whether the allowance of an attorney's fee in such a case, pursuant to the Texas statute, is repugnant to the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, or the act to regulate commerce and amendments thereof.\n By way of preface, we should repeat that the state court of last resort has construed the act as relating only to the collection of claims not exceeding $200 in amount; that by its terms it applies to claims 'against any person or corporation doing business in this state, for personal services rendered or for labor done, or for material furnished, or for overcharges on freight or express, or for any claim for lost or damaged freight, or for stock killed or injured by such person or corporation, its agents or employees' [art. 2178]; and \n\n[234 U.S. 412, 416]\n\u00a0\n that, in the Cade Case, we have held it to be a police regulation designed to promote the prompt payment of small but well-founded claims, and to discourage unnecessary litigation in respect to them; and have held it, in its general application, to be not repugnant to either the 'equal protection' or the 'due process' clauses of the 14th Amendment.\n Such being the character of the statute, and it having a broad sweep which only incidentally includes claims arising out of interstate commerce, it follows that it cannot be held to constitute a direct burden upon such commerce, and hence repugnant to the commerce clause of the Contitution, or otherwise in conflict with the Federal authority, in the absence of legislation by Congress covering the subject. To this extent, the case is controlled by the decision in Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Mazursky, \n216 U.S. 122\n, 54 L. ed. 411, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 378, where it was held that a South Carolina statute which required common carriers doing business in the state to settle claims for loss or damage to property while in the possession of the carrier within forty days, in case of shipments wholly within the state, and within ninety days, in case of shipments from without the state, and that failure to adjust and pay a claim within the prescribed period should subject the carrier to a penalty of $50 in case the full amount claimed was recovered, as the statute was applied to a claim for loss or damage to interstate freight while in the possession of the carrier within the state, was not an unwarrantable interference with interstate commerce, in the absence of legislation by Congress, but was rather a regulation in aid of the performance by the carrier of its legal duty. The decision was rested upon the authority and reasoning of Sherlock v. Alling, \n93 \nU.S. 99, 104\n, 23 S. L. ed. 819, 820; Smith v. Alabama, \n124 \nU.S. 465, 476\n, 31 S.

Rep. 729.\n But the 'act to regulate commerce' (act of February 4, 1887, 24 Stat. at L. 379, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3154) is now invoked, together with its amendments, and especially that part of the Hepburn act of June 29, 1906, known as the Carmack amendment (34 Stat. at L. 584, 595, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, pp. 1288, 1307); and it remains to be considered whether the Texas statute, as applied to claims for loss or damage to interstate freight while in the possession of the carrier in the state of Texas, is repugnant to this Federal legislation. It is, of course, settled that when Congress has exerted its paramount legislative authority over a particular subject of interstate commerce, state laws upon the same subject are superseded. Northern P. R. Co. v. Washington, \n222 \nU.S. 370, 378\n, 56 S. L. ed. 237, 239, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 160; Erie R. Co. v. New York, decided May 25, 1914, \n234 U.S. 671\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 756. But it is equally well settled that the mere creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the grant to it of a measure of control over interstate commerce, does not of itself, and in the absence of specific action by the Commission or by Congress itself, interfere with the authority of the states to establish regulations conducive to the welfare and convenience of their citizens, even though interstate commerce be thereby incidently affected, so long as it be not directly burdened or interfered with. Missouri P. R. Co. v. Larabee Flour Mills Co. \n211 \nU.S. 612, 623\n, 53 S. L. ed. 352, 361, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 214; Southern R. Co. v. Reid, \n222 \nU.S. 424, 437\n, 56 S. L. ed. 257, 260, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 140.\n In the Larabee Mills Case it was held that the railroad company, by engaging in the business of a common carrier, had become subject to certain duties imposed upon it by general law, including the obligation to treat all shippers alike; that the enforcement of this duty and the regulation of matters pertaining to it were within the authority \n\n[234 U.S. 412, 418]\n\u00a0\n of the state, although interstate commerce was thereby indirectly affected; and that until specific action by Congress or the Commission, the control of the state over such incidental matters remained undisturbed. Hence, a decision by the supreme court of Kansas, awarding a mandamus to require the company to restore the service of transferring cars between the lines of another railroad and the Larabee mills and elevator, in aid of interstate and intrastate shipments alike, was affirmed. This case arose after the enactment of the Hepburn act.\n On the other hand, it was held in the Reid Case that since Congress had taken control of the subject of the making of rates and charges, and by  2 of the Hepburn act had forbidden the carrier to engage or participate in transportation unless the rates, fares, and charges had been filed and published in accordance with the provisions of the act, a state law requiring railroad companies to receive freight for transportation whenever tendered at a regular station, and to forward the same over the route selected by the person offering the shipment, under a penalty of $50 a day, besides all damages incurred, was in necessary conflict, since it required the carrier to do the very things forbidden by the Federal law.\n So, in Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Hardwick Farmers Elevator Co. \n226 U.S. 426\n, 57 L. ed. 284, 46 L.R.A.(N.S.) 203, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174, it was held that since, by the Hepburn act, Congress had legislated concerning deliveries of cars in interstate commerce by carriers subject to the act, specifically requiring the carrier to provide and furnish 'transportation' (cars being embraced within the definition of the term) upon reasonable request, the authority of the state of Minnesota to legislate upon the subject of the delivery of cars when called for to be used in interstate traffic was superseded. And see Yazoo & M. Valley R. Co. v. Greenwood Grocery Co. \n227 U.S. 1\n, 57 L. ed. 389, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 213.\n These cases recognize the established rule that a state law enacted under any of the reserved powers-especially \n\n[234 U.S. 412, 419]\n\u00a0\n if under the police power-is not to be set aside as inconsistent with an act of Congress, unless there is actual repugnancy, or unless Congress has, at least, manifested a purpose to exercise its paramount authority over the subject. The rule rests upon fundamental grounds that should not be disregarded. In Reid v. Colorado, \n187 \nU.S. 137, 148\n, 47 S. L. ed. 108, 114, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 92, 12 Am. Crim. Rep. 506, the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Harlan, said: 'It should never be held that Congress intends to supersede or by its legislation suspend the exercise of the police powers of the states, even when it may do so, unless its purpose to effect that result is clearly manifested. This court has said-and the principle has been often reaffirmed-that 'in the application of this principle of supremacy of an act of Congress in a case where the state law is but the exercise of a reserved power, the repugnance or conflict should be direct and positive, so that the two acts could not be reconciled or consistently stand together.' Sinnot v. Davenport, 22 How. 227, 243, 16 L. ed. 243, 247.' In Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 533\n, 56 S. L. ed. 1182, 1194, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 715, the court said: 'When the question is whether a Federal act overrides a state law, the entire scheme of the statute must, of course, be considered, and that which needs must be implied is of no less force than that which is expressed. If the purpose of the act cannot otherwise be accomplished,-if its operation within its chosen field else must be frustrated and its provisions be refused their natural effect-the state law must yield to the regulation of Congress within the sphere of its delegated power [citing cases]. But the intent to supersede the exercise by the state of its police power as to matters not covered by the Federal legislation is not to be inferred from the mere fact that Congress has seen fit to circumscribe its regulation and to occupy a limited field. In other words, such intent is not to be implied unless the act of Congress, fairly interpreted, is in actual conflict with the law of the state.' [ Citing many cases.]\n With respect to the specific effect of the Carmack \n\n[234 U.S. 412, 420]\n\u00a0\n amendment (set forth in the margin , it has been held, in a series of recent cases (Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 57 L. ed. 314, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148; Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Miller, \n226 U.S. 513\n, 57 L. ed. 323, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 155; Chicago, St. P.

Hooker, \n233 U.S. 97\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 526), that the special regulations and policies of particular states upon the subject of the carrier's liability for loss or damage to interstate shipments, and the contracts of carriers with respect thereto, have been superseded.\n But the Texas statute now under consideration does not in anywise either enlarge or limit the responsibility of the carrier for the loss of property intrusted to it in transportation, and only incidentally affects the remedy for enforcing that responsibility. As pointed out in the Cade\n That any common carrier, railroad, or transportation company receiving property for transportation from a point in one state to a point in another state shall issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor, and shall be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss, damage, or injury to such property caused by it or by any common carrier, railroad, or transportation company to which such property may be delivered, or over whose line or lines such property may pass, and no contract, receipt, rule, or regulation shall exempt such common carrier, railroad, or transportation company from the liability hereby imposed; Provided, That nothing in this section shall deprive any holder of such receipt or bill of lading of any remedy or right of action which he has under existing law.\n That the common carrier, railroad, or transportation company issuing such receipt or bill of lading shall be entitled to recover from the common carrier, railroad, or transportation company on whose line the loss, damage, or injury shall have been sustained the amount of such loss, damage, or injury as it may be required to pay to the owners of such property, as may be evidenced by any receipt, judgment, or transcript thereof. \n\n[234 U.S. 412, 421]\n\u00a0\n CASE, \n233 U.S. 642\n, 58 L. ED. --, 34 Sup. ct. rep. 678, IT IMPOSEs not a penalty, but a compensatory allowance for the expense of employing an attorney, applicable in cases where the carrier unreasonably delays payment of a just demand and thereby renders a suit necessary. In fact and effect, it merely authorizes a moderate increment of the recoverable costs of suit in the large class of cases that are within its sweep, among which are incidentally included claims for freight lost or damaged in interstate commerce.\n It is true that in Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Riverside Mills, \n219 \nU.S. 186, 208\n, 55 S. L. ed. 167, 183, 31 L.R.A.(N.S.) 7, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 164 (a case arising since the Hepburn act), it was held that  8 of the act of February 4, 1887, does not authorize the allowance of a counsel or attorney's fee in an action for loss of property intrusted to the carrier for purposes of transportation. But that is far from holding that it is not permissible for a state, as a part of its local procedure, to permit the allowance of a reasonable attorney's fee, under proper restrictions. In claims of this character, based upon the ordinary liability of the common carrier, although regulated by the commerce act, the state courts have full jurisdiction, and some differences respecting the allowance of costs and the amount of the costs are inevitable, as being peculiar to the forum. And we think that where a state, as in this instance, for reasons of internal policy, in order to offer a reasonable incentive to the prompt settlement of small but well-founded claims, and as a deterrent of groundless defenses, establishes by a general statute otherwise unexceptionable the policy of allowing recovery of a moderate attorney's fee as a part of the costs, in cases where, after specific claim made and a reasonable time given for investigation of it, payment is refused, and the claimant succeeds in establishing by suit his right to the full amount demanded, the application of such statute to actions for goods lost in interstate commerce is not inconsistent with the provisions of the commerce act and its amendments. The local \n\n[234 U.S. 412, 422]\n\u00a0\n statute, as already pointed out, does not at all affect the ground of recovery, or the measure of recovery; it deals only with a question of costs, respecting which Congress has not spoken. Until Congress does speak, the state may enforce it in such a case as the present.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","140":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI, K & T R. CO. v. WEST(1914)\nNo. 696\nArgued: March 3, 1914Decided: March 23, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. W. R. Allen, Clifford L. Jackson, and Joseph M. Bryson for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Charles H. Taylor, Benjamin Martin, Jr., S. Grant Harris, and Thomas D. O'Brien for defendant in error. \n\n[232 U.S. 682, 683]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Action for damages, brought by defendant in error against plaintiff in error (herein called the railway company) for the death of William B. West, husband of the defendant in error, caused by the collision of two trains of the railway company. The case was tried to a jury and resulted in a verdict and judgment for defendant in error in the sum of $15,000. The judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state, and error was prosecuted from this court.\n There is no dispute about the collision, the cause of it, or that it resulted in the death of the deceased. He and the plaintiff below were residents of Kansas, and she brought the suit, as she alleged in her complaint, as his widow, and for the benefit of herself as such widow and their three minor children. No personal representative of his estate was appointed.\n She alleged that the deceased at the time of his death was employed by the American Express Company as express messenger upon the express cars operated by the railway company over its line of railroad from Parsons, Kansas, through the state of Oklahoma, to points in the state of Texas. That in addition to his duties as express messenger he was also engaged in handling passenger baggage upon the express cars of the railway company. The plaintiff then alleged the deceased came to his death in the course of his employment while riding in the express car, by reason of a head-on collision of the train with a freight train between certain stations in Oklahoma.\n A demurrer was filed which attacked the legal capacity of the plaintiff to sue for her minor children, and the sufficiency of the complaint, and alleged as well that there was a defect of parties. The demurrer was overruled, and the case put at final issue by a third amended answer \n\n[232 U.S. 682, 684]\n\u00a0\n (amended again at the trial) filed by the railway company. It denied negligence on its part, and alleged negligence on the part of the deceased, and that it was engaged in moving interstate commerce. It alleged also that the deceased had made application to the American Express Company at Parsons, Kansas, for a position as a driver of one of its wagons, and was engaged by the express company in pursuance of a written application (copy of which was attached to the answer), that he was employed by the express company (a copy of the contract being attached to the answer), and in consideration of his employment he assumed all risk of accident and injury which he should meet with or sustain in the course of his employment, whether occasioned by or resulting from the gross or other negligence of any corporation or person engaged in any manner in operating any railroad or vessel or vehicle, or of any employee of any such corporation or person, or otherwise, and whether resulting in his death or otherwise. That in case of injury he would at once and without demand execute and deliver a good and sufficient release of all claims, demands, and causes of action arising out of such injury, or connected with or resulting therefrom. That by the terms of his contract he ratified all agreements made by the express company and any such corporation or person that its employees should have no cause of action for injuries sustained in the course of their employment, and agreed to be bound by such agreements as though he were a party thereto, and authorized the express company to contract for him that neither he nor any of his personal representatives, nor any person claiming under him, should claim compensation because of injury sustained by him, whether resulting from gross or other negligence of such corporations, persons, or employees. That such contract should inure to the benefit of any corporation or person over whose railroads or steamboat lines the express company should forward merchan- \n\n[232 U.S. 682, 685]\n\u00a0\n dise, and this in consideration of his employment by the express company. That in pursuance of his contract of employment by the express company he was in the express car of the railway company, and that he was barred from maintaining the action.\n The answer concluded with the following paragraph:\n'Further answering, defendant admits that at and prior to the death of said William B. West, deceased, he was employed by the American Express Company as express messenger upon the express cars operated by the defendant railway company over its line of road . . . and admits that the deceased, William B. West, in addition to his employment as express messenger by the said American Express Company, was also engaged in handling passenger baggage upon the express car of said defendant railway company, and . . . in performing said duties in handling said baggage was doing so under and by virtue of his said employment by the said American Express Company, and that such handling of such baggage by said West was for and in behalf of and under the direction of said railway company.'\n\n Defendant in error filed a reply to the answer in which she affirmed the allegations of her complaint and denied those of the answer, and alleged besides that at the time the contracts set out in the answer were made and ever since the statutes of Kansas provided as follows:\n'That railroads in this state shall be liable for all damages done to persons or property when done in consequence of any neglect on the part of the railroad company.\n\n'Every railroad company organized and doing business in the state of Kansas shall be liable for all damages done to any employee of such company in consequence of any negligence of its agents, or by any mismanagement of its engineers or other employees, to any person sustaining such damage. Provided that notice in writing that an injury \n\n[232 U.S. 682, 686]\n\u00a0\n has been sustained, stating the time and place thereof, shall have been given by or on behalf of the person injured to such railroad company within eight months after the occurrence of the injury.'\n\n A demurrer to the reply was overruled.\n The simple question which is presented here is whether the deceased was employed at the time of his death by the railway company or by the American Express Company. On those alternates depends the jurisdiction of this court; and defendant in error, asserting that such employment was a question of fact decided by the state courts against the railway company, makes a motion to dismiss the writ of error.\n There were two opinions delivered by the supreme court of the state. In its first opinion the court said that the railway company contended that the defendant's liability was controlled by the 'employers' liability act' [35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1322]; but the court, after quoting its provisions, decided that the pleadings and evidence demonstrated that the deceased was in the employment of the American Express Company at the time of his death, and that therefore the national act did not apply. The court also noticed the other rulings which were called to its attention; among others, one based on the action of the trial court refusing to admit in evidence the contracts attached to the answer. The court declined to consider the latter ruling, holding that, under the practice of the court, the error was not properly before it for review, and for the further reason that in the brief and argument of the railway company the ruling was 'not attempted to be insisted upon or urged as error,' citing Noble State Bank v. Haskell, 22 Okla. 48, 97 Pac. 590. And the court said the omission could not be cured by a reply brief when the same was not predicated upon a specification of error, permission not having been first obtained for the purpose of amending the specifications of error. \n\n[232 U.S. 682, 687]\n\u00a0\n The court was also of opinion that the contract of the deceased by which, it was contended, he assumed the risk of injuries, and released all rights of action for them, was 'void as against public policy, on account of being in contravention of the laws of the state of Kansas, and against the public policy' of Oklahoma.\n The second opinion was delivered upon a petition for rehearing in which the railway company earnestly combated the conclusions of the court, expressed in the first opinion, repeated its contentions, and insisted that the case was tried on the theory that the issue made by the pleadings was whether the deceased was an employee of the railway company, and that the evidence showed that he was such employee. The court rejected the contentions and decided that the pleadings alleged, and the evidence was consistent with the allegation, that West was employed by the express company.\n There is, therefore, a sharp antagonism between the views of the court and of the railway company, and yet there is not much dispute over the elements of the controversy, but rather in the inferences from them.\n The essential facts pleaded we have given. The allegation of the complaint is that West, 'at and prior to the time' of his death, 'was employed by the American Express Company as express messenger upon the express cars operated by said defendant company,' and 'that in addition to his duties and employment as messenger' he was 'also engaged in handling passenger baggage upon' such cars, and 'in the course of his employment . . . was riding in one of the express cars' of the railway company. The direct averment, therefore, is that West was employed by the express company, and that he handled baggage and was riding in the express cars in the course of this employment and as part of its duties. A relation with the railway company is, it is true, averred. He handled its baggage and rode in its cars. But this did not \n\n[232 U.S. 682, 688]\n\u00a0\n make him its employee. If he was, such is not disclosed by the complaint, nor is it alleged in the answer of the railway company. Indeed, his employment by the express company is emphasized by the contracts attached to the answer, and a defense is based upon them. It is averred that West, by these contracts, assumed all the risks of his employment by the express company, ratified the contracts of the latter, authorized it in his name to release any demand he might have for injuries, agreed to be bound by whatever covenants the company should make, and that neither he nor any of his personal representatives would claim compensation for injuries, whether resulting from negligence or otherwise. These contracts are explicitly averred, as constituting the consideration for West's 'employment by said express company;' and it is alleged that he was 'being transported by this defendant . . . in pursuance of said contract, hereinbefore referred to as 'Exhibit B,\" and 'that plaintiff is therefore now barred from maintaining this action.'\n These allegations do not deny, but rather aver, the employment of West by the express company, and were intended as a security to that company, and through it to any transportation company or person. Their basis distinctly is that injury might result to West in his employment, and they were intended to prevent legal liability for it. Whether they had that effect is not a Federal question.\n The railway company, however, contends that the evidence conclusively shows that the deceased was an employee of the railway company, and that certainty of proof is no doubt asserted for it to countervail the combined judgments of the jury and of the trial and supreme courts. The latter court, in its second opinion, however, considering the effect of the contracts between the express company and the deceased, and the oral evidence upon which the railway company relied, said: 'We therefore find with the court below that the pleadings and the evidence con- \n\n[232 U.S. 682, 689]\n\u00a0\n clusively show that the deceased suffered the injuries that resulted in his death while he was employed by the express company, and not while he was employed by the railway company in interstate commerce within the meaning of the Federal employers liability act.' The court hence decided that the action was governed by the statutes of Oklahoma.\n What the pleadings alleged and what the contracts showed we have already adverted to. The testimony relied on is that of one of the superintendents of the express company, who, in testifying as to the relation between the deceased and the railway company, said that the deceased was 'agent, messenger, and baggageman,' and by this was meant that he 'worked for both companies,' and that the proportion of payment by the companies was an 'equal division.' That his duties were that he 'received the baggage at the stations, made a record of it, and put it off at its destination in the same manner any baggageman did.' The witness further said that the deceased knew that he was to handle the baggage of the railway company and act as joint employee of it and the express company, and was 'told to post himself in the work of both companies.' On cross-examination, however, the witness testified that all of the salary of the deceased 'came from the express company.' The railway company 'paid us one half of his salary; we drew a bill against them in his name and the other baggageman.'\n Counsel for the railway company urge that the strength of this testimony is such that it needs no reinforcement from argument, and they say that it has confirmation besides in a circular letter addressed by the superintendent of the express company to all of the messengers of the company. The letter, however, was not admitted in evidence, and no error was assigned in the supreme court upon the ruling. We are unable, therefore, to consider it, notwithstanding counsel's plaintiff-often repeated-that \n\n[232 U.S. 682, 690]\n\u00a0\n they were deceived by their conception, justified, it is insisted, that the case was tried upon the theory that the deceased was an employee of the railway company.\n This theory the railway company makes a great deal of. It constituted the basis of the petition for rehearing, and, by disregarding it, it was contended and is contended, the court was led into error. The court, however, rejected the theory, deciding that it was not justified by the pleadings, complaint, or answer, nor by the evidence in the case.\n The court grouped the contentions of the railway company under four heads: (1) Plaintiff in the action (defendant in error here) was not the proper party to maintain the action; (2) error in instructions; (3) error in excluding the three written contracts attached to the answer; (4) amount of damages.\n The first contention is the determining one, as we have already said. Upon it depends the Federal question; that is, whether the laws of Oklahoma controlled the action or the employers' liability act. And this turns necessarily upon the other question, whether the deceased was employed by the railway company or by the express company,-a question of fact found in the first instance by the jury against the present contention of the railway company, and sustained by the trial court on motion for a new trial, and the supreme court in two opinions.\n The finding having support in the record, it is contended that this court cannot question it, and that therefore the writ of error should be dismissed. The railway company cites in resistance the case of St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. McWhirter, \n229 U.S. 265\n, 57 L. ed. 1179, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 858, and St. Louis, S. F. & T. R. Co. v. Seale, \n229 U.S. 156\n, 57 L. ed. 1129, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 651. The cited cases are not like the case at bar. In the McWhirter Case the action was in express terms based on a statute of the United States,-the hours of service act of 1907 [34 Stat. at L. 1415, chap. 2939, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1321]. It was contended that the pleadings embraced as well an action at common law, and that such cause of action was sustained and was \n\n[232 U.S. 682, 691]\n\u00a0\n broad enough to support the judgment, irrespective of what may have been decided concerning the statute of the United States, and a motion to dismiss was made. The contention was rejected and the motion was denied. It was recognized that the case coming from a state court, the power to review was controlled by Revised Statutes,  709 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575), but it was said, however, that 'where in a controversy of a purely Federal character the claim is made and denied that there was no evidence tending to show liability under the Federal law, such ruling, when duly excepted to, is reviewable, because inherently involving the operation and effect of the Federal law.'\n In the Seale Case the question was whether the plaintiff in error in the case (the railway company) was engaged in interstate commerce. There was no question of the employment by the railway company. The state court decided the question in the negatively, holding that the evidence did not bring the case within the employers' liability act. The case was brought here by writ of error and jurisdiction entertained against a motion to dismiss, and, after examining the evidence, we reversed the ruling of the state court.\n In the case under review the pleadings state a cause of action under the state law, and there is no question of the character of the commerce in which the railway company was engaged; the only question is whether the deceased was its employee or that of the express company. If the answer to the question depended upon evidence, it might be said that the cited cases are the same in principle, both the fact of interstate commerce and the fact of employment by the railway company of the deceased being conditions which would bring the case under the Federal enactment; or that such employment was one of those subsidiary or connecting facts into which this court will inquire as determining its jurisdiction, of which there are examples. Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. C. H. Albers Commission Co. \n\n[232 U.S. 682, 692]\n\u00a0\n \n223 U.S. 573\n, 56 L. ed. 556, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 316; Cedar Rapids Gaslight Co. v. Cedar Rapids, \n223 U.S. 655\n, 56 L. ed. 594, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 389; Brinkmeier v. Missouri P. R. Co. \n224 U.S. 268\n, 56 L. ed. 758, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 412; Creswill v. Grand Lodge, K. P. \n225 U.S. 246\n, 56 L. ed. 1074, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 822. At any rate, we might, if the fact turned on the evidence, say that the Federal question asserted was not manifestly lacking in color of merit, and follow, therefore, the ruling in Swafford v. Templeton, \n185 U.S. 487\n, 46 L. ed. 1005, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 783.\n But the supreme court of the state rested its decision upon the allegation of fact of employment of the deceased by the express company, and the admission of the fact in the answer of the railway company, and held that there was nothing in the course of the trial which obviated the effect of the allegations and admissions of the pleadings. The court, after quoting the paragraph of the answer which we have given above, said that its 'admissions are in entire harmony with the balance of the answer, which contains allegation after allegation positively stating that the deceased was employed by the express company continuously for a great many years prior to his death, and the contracts of employment between the express company and the deceased are attached to the answer and made a part thereof, and certain waivers contained therein are relied upon as a defense.' And, further, 'From the pleadings alone it is clear that the deceased suffered the injuries which resulted in his death while he was employed by the express company, and not while he was employed by the railway company; and that the parties did not attempt to join an issue of fact upon that question.' The expression in the opinion was that if the evidence disclosed a case different from that alleged in the pleadings, the Federal statute would control and St. Louis, S. F. & T. R. Co. v. Seale, \n229 U.S. 156\n, 57 L. ed. 1129, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 651, would be applicable. But the court said that the testimony of Adams, the superintendent of the express company, relied on by the railway company, was 'in no way inconsistent with the allegations of the petition and the admissions of the answer,' BECAUSE ' \n\n[232 U.S. 682, 693]\n\u00a0\n THE WITNESS MERELY DREW ERRONEous conclusions from admitted facts, and that his testimony as a whole supplemented the allegations of the petition and the admissions of the answer by more fully disclosing the relations existing between the express company and the deceased, and the express company and the railway company, and made it more clearly apparent that the decedent was rightfully on the train.' [134 Pac. 658.]\n The court, therefore, considered the case distinguishable from the cases cited by the railway company (Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Reasor, 28 Tex. Civ. App. 302, 68 S. W. 332; Vary v. Burlington, C. R. & M. R. Co. 42 Lowa, 246; Oliver v. Northern P. R. Co. 196 Fed. 432), and made no comment upon them except to say that they in no way conflicted with the conclusion reached.\n The state court having decided, with substantial Co. 42 Iowa, 246; Oliver v. Northern P. R. pleadings and evidence show an action under the employment by the express company, no denial of Federal right is involved, and, therefore, motion to dismiss must be granted. And, as the action was brought under the state law, and not under the Federal law, it becomes unnecessary to notice errors assigned by the railway company, including that based on the instruction of the trial court that a verdict could be rendered by three fourths of the jury.\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","141":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMISSOURI, KANSAS, & TEXAS RAILWAY CO. v.

Brown for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Thompson and John W. Davis for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This claim, as construed by the claimant and appellant, is based upon covenants supposed to be imported by an act of Congress of July 25, 1866, chap. 241,  9. 14 Stat. at L. 236. Upon demurrer it was dismissed by the court of claims. 47 Ct. Cl. 59. The largeness of the demand tends to induce a correspondingly voluminous statement, but the issue really is narrow and the material facts are few.\n The United States had made land grants to the great roads running east and west, but had not provided for a connection between those roads and the Gulf, through Kansas and the Indian territory to the south. To that end, the act of July 25, 1866, after granting to Kansas, for the use of a road to be built through eastern Kansas from the eastern terminus of the Union Pacific between Kansas and Missouri, ten alternate sections per mile on each side of the road,  1, authorized the company mentioned to extend its road from the southern boundary of Kansas south, through the Indian territory to Red river, at or near Preston, in Texas, so as to connect with a road then being constructed from Galveston to that point.  8. The appellant also had been authorized by charter to build a road running southerly from a point on the Union Pacific to where the southern boundary of Kansas crosses the Neosho river, and had acquired a land grant; and the act of July 25, 1866, went on to provide that if the appellant, under its former name of Union \n\n[235 U.S. 37, 39]\n\u00a0\n Pacific Railway, Southern Branch, first completed its road to the point of crossing the southern boundary of Kansas, it should be authorized to construct its line to the point near Preston, 'with grants of land according to the provisions of this act.' The right of way was granted in accordance with treaties with the Indians, and is not in question here.\n The appellant finished its road first, built the southern extension, and acquired the rights to land under the act of 1866, and the question is what rights it has, in the event that has happened, under  9. That section enacted 'that the same grants of land through said Indian territory are hereby made as provided in the first section of this act, whenever the Indian title shall be extinguished by treaty or otherwise, not to exceed to ratio per mile granted in the first section of this act; Provided, That said lands become a part of the public lands of the United States.' This part of the Indian territory was occupied by the five civilized tribes, and what has happened is that, under acts of Congress, the land concerned has been distributed in severalty to the members of those tribes, or sold for their benefit.\n Taken literally, the grant or covenant of the United States was subject to two conditions precedent. 'Whenever the Indian title shall be extinguished' means when and not until that occurs; and contemplates it as something that may or may not come to pass. That proviso attaches the further condition that if the Indian title shall be extinguished, it must be extinguished in such a way that the lands become a part of the public domain. It cannot be said that 'whenever' imports that sooner or later the Indian title will and shall be disposed of. The Indians had to be considered, and it could not be assumed that they would be removed to another place, as they had been removed before. It cannot be said, either, that, on the face of the clause, the proviso adds nothing, and means \n\n[235 U.S. 37, 40]\n\u00a0\n only that, on extinction of the Indian title, the rights of the railroad shall attach as if the land were public land. The section, taken by itself and on its face, excludes the claimant's interpretation that the United States made an absolute promise or grant, and it excludes it none the less that certain services were to be rendered by the road to the United States as one of the terms of the grant of a right of way which the railroad got. On this literal reading of the statute the conditions have not been fulfilled. The land has remained continuously appropriated to the use of the Indians, or has been sold for their benefit. It never for a moment has become a part of the public domain in the ordinary sense. Newhall v. Sanger, \n92 \nU.S. 761, 763\n, 23 S. L. ed. 769, 770; Union P. R. Co. v. Harris, \n215 \nU.S. 386, 388\n, 54 S. L. ed. 246, 247, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 138. It is argued that the grant attached the moment that the tribal title ceased, whatever it was. But, still looking only at the face of the act, and seeing the intent to respect the Indian rights, we cannot read it as preventing the United States from making the change from tribal to several possessions, or dealing with this land in any way deemed most beneficial for those whose rights were treated as paramount. The proviso that the land must become public land shows that a mere change from tribal title was not enough. Taken literally, the grant only applied in case the Indians were removed or bought off the land.\n The facts existing at the time confirm the literal interpretation of the act. Less than a week before the passage of the statute the United States had made a treaty with the Cherokees that contemplated the possible allotment of their share in this land to be held in severalty. Treaty of July 19, 1866, art. 16, 14 Stat at L. 799, 804. On June 14, 1866, it had agreed with the Creeks that their lands should be forever set apart as a home for the nation. 14 Stat. at L. 785. And by a treaty of April 28, 1866, art. 11, it had agreed with the Choctaws and Chickasaws that \n\n[235 U.S. 37, 41]\n\u00a0\n they might have their lands surveyed and divided up, reciting that it was believed that the holding of the land in severalty would promote the general civilization of said nation. 14 Stat. at L. 769, 774. Whether or not, as the government contends, the title of these tribes to the land in controversy was higher than the original possessory right, the United States, as the appellant must be taken to have known, just before its covenant with the railroad, had been holding out to the Indians the desirableness and possibility of dividing up their lands into individual holdings; and it would be to accuse the government of bad faith to one party or the other to suggest that it forthwith agreed with the appellant that the moment such a division and allotment took place the appellant thereby should acquire a paramount title and render the allotment vain. See, further, Kansas v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 331, 341\n, 342 S., 51 L. ed. 510, 513, 514, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 388.\n The action of Congress in making the allotment to individuals shows in express terms that it did not suppose that the railroads would, or intend that they should, acquire any new rights. Act of March 1, 1901, chap. 676, 23, 31 Stat. at L. 861, 868; July 1, 1902, chap. 1362, 32 Stat. at L. 641; July 1, 1902, chap. 1375, 32 Stat. at L. 716; April 26, 1906, chap. 1876,  27, 34 Stat. at L. 137, 148. Our conclusion from the words of the statute and the circumstances seems to us too plain to require a reference to the rule of strict construction against the grantee of the government in case of doubt, and seems to us unaffected by the argument that a grant in proesenti was made by  9. It appears to us that the appellant's claim stands most strongly if based upon a covenant; but, covenant or grant, the concession of the United States was dependent upon conditions that have not been fulfilled.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMITCHELL STORE BLDG.

The Mitchell Store Building Company brought suit against the Duhme Jewelry Company in the common pleas court of Hamilton county, Ohio, to recover under the lease, also applying to the district court for an order on the trustee to withhold sufficient in amount of the assets of the Duhme Jewelry Company to satisfy its claim, which was eventually refused by the referee, and is now before the district judge upon petition for review.\n Upon the petition of the trustee, the Mitchell Store Building Company was made a party to the bankruptcy proceeding, in the district court, and later the trustee \n\n[232 U.S. 379, 381]\n\u00a0\n sought to restrain that company from prosecuting its suit in the state court. The district judge granted a temporary injunction, and upon appeal the circuit court of appeals affirmed the order of the district court. There was also a petition to review the order of the district court, granting the temporary injunction, but that was not passed upon by the circuit court of appeals. The case was then brought to this court by appeal, the petition for appeal stating that 'this cause is one in which the United States circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit has not final jurisdiction, and that it is a proper cause to be reviewed by the Supreme Court of the United States on appeal.'\n The jurisdiction of the appellate courts of the United States, including this court, under the bankruptcy act, is regulated by  24 and 25 of that act. Under the latter section appeals may be taken in certain cases from the district court to the circuit court of appeals, and, under certain limitations, appeals may be allowed from the latter court to this court, from final decisions of the circuit court of appeals allowing or rejecting claims. This case does not come within  25. Section 24a provides for appeals in controversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings, and controls the present case. In such cases the appeal takes the course prescribed in the circuit court of appeals act (26 Stat. at L. 826, 828, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 488, 549). See Hewit v. Berlin Mach. Works, \n194 U.S. 296\n, 48 L. ed. 986, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 690; Coder v. Arts, \n213 U.S. 223\n, 53 L. ed. 772, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 436, 16 Ann. Cas. 1008\n\n\n It is undertaken to sue out the appeal in this case from the circuit court of appeals under  6 of the circuit court of appeals act, as the petition for allowance of appeal shows; while the appeal to the circuit court of appeals was under  (7 of that act, as amended (31 Stat. at. L. 660, chap. 803, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 551), providing for an appeal from an interlocutory order of a district or circuit court, granting an injunction, to the circuit court of appeals \n\n[232 U.S. 379, 382]\n\u00a0\n in a cause in which an appeal from a final decree might have been taken under the act. No provision is made in this section, or in any other, for a further appeal concerning such interlocutory orders, to this court.\n Section 6 regulates appeals from the circuit court of appeals to this court, providing that cases not made final by that section shall be entitled to review in this court. While this case, taken to the circuit court of appeals under  7, is not one of the class made final in that court by  6, it is well settled that this court's jurisdiction under  6 relates solely to final orders of the district court reviewed by the circuit court of appeals. The decree in the district court being an interlocutory order granting a temporary injunction, and the circuit court of appeals simply affirming that order, it is not a proper case for appeal to this court. Kirwan v. Murphy, \n170 U.S. 205\n, 42 L. ed. 1009, 18 Sup. Ct.

Rosaly v. Graham y Frazer, \n227 \nU.S. 584, 590\n, 57 S. L. ed. 655, 657, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 333.\n The appellants sued in August, 1909, to recover immovable property upon the ground that a contract of sale made by them of the property in September, 1906, subject to a right to redeem, was not a sale subject to condition, but a mortgage, and, therefore, although the period for redemption had long expired without the exercise of that right, they were entitled to a decree for cancelation of the recorded sale on payment of the mortgage debt. Moreover, a right to recover rents and revenues was sought for the purpose of imputing the amount to the extinction of the mortgage debt. At the trial Juan A. Monagas, one of the plaintiffs, was tendered in their behalf as a witness, and he was permitted to testify over objection made and exception reserved by the defendant. The court substantially awarded the relief prayed. The prayer, however, for an accounting, was denied upon the ground that, although there was no agreement as to rate of interest, nevertheless it was contemplated that the lender should go into possession of the property, collect the rents and revenues, and appropriate them in lieu of collecting interest on the debt. Both sides appealed.\n On the appeal it developed in the argument that neither side had complied with the rules as to assigning errors. The case was heard and taken under advisement with leave to file assignments of errors within a time fixed. In its opinion the court came first to the appeal of the defendant below. Directing attention to the fact that the permission to file assignments had not been complied with, the court then considered what was open, and after referring to the exception concerning the testimony of the witness, offered for the purpose of showing that the deed was not a sale, but was a mortgage, treated the exception \n\n[235 U.S. 81, 83]\n\u00a0\n as covering two considerations: first, Was parol evidence admissible, 'under our Civil Code, to vary the terms of the sale?' and second, whether 'An improper construction was put on the written contract entered into between the parties,' evidently considering, therefore, that even if parol evidence was admissible, it was yet necessary, as a result of the exception, to determine whether the contract had been improperly construed by a wrongful effect given to the evidence admitted over objection.\n The contention as to mere inadmissibility was at once disposed of by stating that the real question to be decided was not whether any testimony could have been received, but the character and probative force of that which was admissible. The court said:\n'The whole case really turns on the question of whether the written instrument in controversy was a mortgage or a conditional sale. If it is the latter, it must be complied with according to its terms; if the former, the plaintiff must be allowed to repay the money received and take a reconveyance of the land. The real intention of the parties at the time the written instrument was made must govern in the interpretation given to it by the courts. This must be ascertained from the circumstances surrounding the transaction and from the language of the document itself. The correct test, where it can be applied, is the continued existence of a debt or liability between the parties. If such exists, the conveyance may be held to be merely a security for the debt or an indemnity against the liability. On the contrary, if no debt or liability is found to exist, then the transaction is not a mortgage, but merely a sale with a contract of repurchase within a fixed time. While every case depends on its own special facts, certain circumstances are considered as important, and the courts regard them as throwing much light upon the real intent of the parties and upon the nature of such transactions: such are the existence of a collateral agreement made by \n\n[235 U.S. 81, 84]\n\u00a0\n the grantor for the payment of money to the grantee, his liability to pay interest, inadequacy of price paid for the conveyance, the grantor still remaining in possession of the land conveyed, and any negotiation or application for a loan made preceding or during the transaction resulting in the conveyance. The American doctrine on this subject does not differ materially from the principles set forth in our Civil Code. 3 Pom. Eq. Jur . 1194 and 1195. Civil Code of Porto Rico, 1248-1250, 1348, 1410; and 1421.' [17 P. R. R. 686.]\n\n Coming, then, presumably to analyze the testimony admitted over the objection for the purpose of ascertaining whether it was of a character to engender any probative force proper to be considered for the purpose of showing that the minds of the parties met not on a conditional sale, but a mortgage, and therefore justified construing the written contract to be not what it purported to be, it was held that it did not, the court saying: 'In accordance with these principles we must consider the conveyance in this case as a conditional sale and that plaintiff has failed to comply therewith;' it being added, 'We are further satisfied that the exception of the defendant was well taken and ought to have been sustained; and that the court consequently erred in its judgment.' The decree was reversed, with direction to dismiss the suit.\n The court in subsequently making its findings of fact and stating its conclusions included therein the testimony of the witness which had been admitted at the trial over objection, that testimony being to the following effect:\n'The witness then proceeded to testify in substance that he applied to the defendant for a loan, and she made him an offer to make negotiations, taking the house in question as security under the conditions stated in the written contract; that he had no intention of selling the house to the defendant, as he had other better offers; and that the contract was made in the form of a deed of sale \n\n[235 U.S. 81, 85]\n\u00a0\n with option of return because she requested it and he had no objection.'\n\n As there is no contention that the findings if accepted do not support the conclusion which the court based on them, it is sufficient to give the following summary: The contract in question was notarial in form, on its face a sale transferring ownership and possession to the purchaser for a stipulated cash price, conditioned, however, on the right of the sellers to redeem within two years on paying a sum equal to the purchase price, no interest being provided for, with the right to extend the time to redeem for one year further if it was elected to do so before the expiration of the original time, and conferring on the purchaser the power of noting on the public records the fact of the failure to redeem, if it took place, and to convert the title if recorded into an unconditional one. The findings disclose that there was no evidence that the right to redeem had been exercised within the time fixed by the contract, that the purchaser inscribed that fact upon the records, and that thereby she became apparently the indefeasible owner. The following facts, however, relating to this subject, were found: (a) That shortly before the original redemption period elapsed, one of the sellers in behalf of all, wrote a letter to the purchaser, asking her to name a time when, before a notary, an agreement of extension could be signed in accordance with the original contract of repurchase, and that no answer appears to have been made to this letter; at all events that nothing was shown establishing that anything was done under it. (b) That after the original period had expired and the failure to avail of the condition had been noted on the public records, three several letters were written, one on October 17th, 1908, one on December 24th, 1908, and the last on May 5th, 1909; the two first requesting the appointment of a day for the purpose of signing an extension of the original time because an agreement expressed in a letter \n\n[235 U.S. 81, 86]\n\u00a0\n to give such extension had been made, and the last offering to pay the amount fixed in the condition of redemption on the ground that there was a right to do so because of an assent to an extension which had been previously given by letter; but, as we have said, the findings recite that nothing as to the existence of the letter referred to was shown in the record. All four of the letters in unequivocal terms treated the contract as having been one of sale and sought to enforce it accordingly, and contained nothing in the slightest degree asserting the existence of a mortgage as now relied upon. Indeed, the findings fail to show anything directly or indirectly asserting that view of the contract prior to its being made the basis of this suit, filed, as we have seen, in August, 1909\n\n\n The conclusions drawn from the findings were as follows:\n'This supreme court disposed of the appeal by its judgment of June the 5th of the last year, reversing that rendered by the court below and ordering the dismissal of the complaint, not only upon the ground that the exception to which we have already referred was well taken and should have been sustained, but also because the agreement made by the parties was a conditional sale.'\n\n As we are bound by the conclusion as to the character of the contract if it is supported by the findings, and as there is no dispute that if the findings be accepted as legal they do support such conclusion, it follows that there must be an affirmance since the real question for decision is, Was the court right in holding that the contract in question was a conditional sale, and not a mortgage? But it is insisted-and that is really the only issue in the case-that the findings cannot be accepted and treated as conclusive without previously determining the correctness of the ruling of the court on the exception to the testimony, since if that ruling be held to have been wrongful, it will follow either that there were no findings, or, if there were such findings in \n\n[235 U.S. 81, 87]\n\u00a0\n form, that they were legally inadequate because made from an incomplete and partial consideration of the evidence resulting from excluding from view the testimony which was wrongfully held to be inadmissible. Indeed, the argument is that this must be the case unless it be assumed that the court, after excluding the testimony on the ground that it was inadmissible, and hence wrong to consider it, proceeded at once to consider it for the purpose of making its findings. From this it is urged that there must be a reversal and remanding for a new trial, or at least for the purpose of enabling the court below to make new findings and express new conclusions upon all the evidence, including that which it should consider if it be found that it was wrong in holding that the evidence excluded was inadmissible.\n But when the statement we have made of the case is considered, the proposition rests upon the plainest misconception of the action of the court below, since, as we have seen, its conclusion that error had been committed by the trial court in holding that the contract of sale was one of mortgage did not arise from a ruling that there was a want of power to admit any testimony for such purpose, but from the fact that the particular testimony which was offered and received over objection was found, after considering and weighing it, to bear no legal relation to such purpose, and hence not to afford any probative force tending to support the varying of the contract. This clearly is made manifest by the excerpt from the opinion of the court which we have quoted and becomes indisputable when it is observed that the authorities which the court cited and relied upon as sustaining its action expressly recognized that testimony was admissible for the purpose of showing that a contract of conditional sale was one of mortgage, but pointed out the nature and character of the testimony and the force of the proof required to accomplish such result. The error of the contention, hence, \n\n[235 U.S. 81, 88]\n\u00a0\n consists in assuming that testimony was not considered and weighed for the purpose of the findings, when in fact, on the face of the record, it is apparent that all the testimony offered was considered and weighed. When this is borne in mind, it results that the contention at last reduces itself to the proposition that the decree below should be reversed and the case remanded because of an error never committed; that is, to enable a duty to be legally performed which the record discloses had already been completely and lawfully discharged.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMONTOYA v. GONZALES(1914)\nNo. 204\nArgued: January 27, 1914Decided: February 24, 1914\n\n\n\n Mr. Alonzo B. McMillen for appellants.\n Messrs. George S. Klock and Neill B. Field for appellees. \n\n[232 U.S. 375, 376]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was begun on June 12, 1906, for the partition, among the remote heirs of Juan Gonzales, of the Alameda land grant, a Spanish grant of land in New Mexico, confirmed as perfect by the court of private land claims of the United States. On June 17, 1907, a judgment of partition was entered, declaring the persons named to be entitled to stated fractional undivided interests, and appointing commissioners to divide the land, or to report to the court if it could not be divided without prejudice to the owners. On July 3, 1907, the commissioners reported that partition could not be made, and before further action of the court, on July 20, 1907, the appellees asked leave to intervene in order to assert adverse interests. The application was allowed on November 20, 1907, and the questions now before this court arise between these interveners and heirs of Gonzales. By way of parenthesis we will dispose of a preliminary objection as this point. It was argued that the decree of partition was a final decree and that the intervention came too late; but apart from the oftenstated disposition of this court to leave decisions upon matters of local procedure undisturbed (Tiaco v. Forbes, \n228 \nU.S. 549, 558\n, 57 S. L. ed. 960, 965, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585), the right to intervene was given by statute 'during the pendency of such suit,' and the decision that the suit still was pending was right. N. M. Comp. Laws, 1897,  3182, Acts of 1907, chap. 107, subsec. 269. See further Clark v. Roller, \n199 \nU.S. 541, 546\n, 50 S. L. ed. 300, 302, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 141.\n The main questions concern the merits of the case. The greater part of the Alameda grant, it is found, has been occupied in strips, from beyond the memory of men now living. The interveners claim such strips, most of them but a few yards wide, but extending, as they say, from the Rio Grande westward to the Ceja or ridge of Rio Puerco,-a distance of some 16 miles. They have \n\n[232 U.S. 375, 377]\n\u00a0\n no documentary evidence of a title derived from Juan Gonzales, but they and their predecessors in title have occupied the bottom lands between the Rio Grande and the foothills to the west for more than ten years under deeds purporting to convey a fee simple in the respective strips to the ridge of Rio Puerco. The eastern part has been fenced, cultivated, and built upon; but from the foothills to the Ceja of Rio Puerco the land is unfenced, and by a general custom has been used mainly for the grazing of cattle by the interveners and others claiming ownership in the grant. The title to this last-mentioned land alone is in question now, and it will be seen that if the interveners have the title they claim, it must have been gained by the lapse of time during which they have held what they have held under the above-mentioned deeds. The judgment was in their favor in the courts below. 16 N. M. 349, 120 Pac. 676.\n The title of the interveners does not depend upon the ordinary statute of limitations, and some considerations that might be relevant under that statute are not relevant here. The title rests upon a peculiar statute that has been in force unchanged in any particular affecting this case, it is said, since 1858. Comp. Laws. 1865, chap. 73,  1, Comp. Laws 1897,  2937. By this act, possession for ten years, under a deed purporting to convey a fee simple, of any lands which have been granted by Spain, Mexico, or the United States, gives a title in fee to the quantity of land specified in the deed, if, during the ten years, no claim by suit in law or equity, effectually prosecuted, shall have been set up. We state the statute according to its construction by the court below, with which, again, we should be slow to interfere (Gray v. Taylor, \n227 \nU.S. 51, 57\n, 58 S. L. ed. 413, 416, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 199), and which also seems plainly right. The interveners, therefore, brought precisely within the words of the act, and we think it unnecessary to spend time on the suggestion that the appellants equally are within it, and \n\n[232 U.S. 375, 378]\n\u00a0\n therefore, on the principle of cases such as Hunnicutt v. Peyton, \n102 U.S. 333\n, 26 L. ed. 113, are entitled to prevail to the strength of their older title so far as they were not actually excluded from the land. The purpose of the act is to ripen disseisin into title according to the deed under which the disseisor holds, and it is especially directed against ancient claims such as the appellants set up.\n It only remains to consider whether there is anything in the Constitution of the United States to prevent the statute from doing its work. We limit our inquiry to its operation in the present case, and do not speculate as to whether other cases could be put in which the letter of some parts of the law could not be sustained. As applied to the interveners, the statute simply enacts that possession for ten years of the front and cultivable portion of a strip under a deed carrying the whold of it back to the ridge of the Puerco shall give title to the whole. We can see no taking of property without due process of law in this. A statute of limitation may give title. Toltec Ranch Co. v. Cook, \n191 U.S. 532\n, 48 L. ed. 291, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 166; Davis v. Mills, \n194 \nU.S. 451, 456\n, 457 S., 48 L. ed. 1067, 1071, 1072, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 692; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co. \n209 U.S. 447\n, 52 L. ed. 881, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 579. The disseisee has notice of the law and of the fact that he is dispossessed, and that a deed to the disseisor may purport to convey more than is fenced in. If he chooses to wait ten years without bringing suit, he is not in a position to complain of the consequences,-at least, not when, as in the present case, the deeds do not purport to convey more than a reasonable man probably would have anticipated. See Soper v. Lawrence Bros. Co. \n201 \nU.S. 359, 367\n, 368 S., 50 L. ed. 788, 790, 791, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 473. For we should conjucture, if it were material, that in this case the deeds under which the interveners held were in a form that was usual and expected in that place.\n The statute does not deny the equal protection of the laws, even if it should be confined to Spanish and Mexican grants. For there very well may have been grounds for \n\n[232 U.S. 375, 379]\n\u00a0\n the discrimination in the history of those grants and the greater probability of an attempt to revive stale claims, as is explained by the supreme court of New Mexico. There is no other matter that we think proper for reconsideration here.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","146":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOORE-MANSFIELD CONST CO. v. ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION CO(1914)\nNo. 358\nArgued: May 5, 1914Decided: June 22, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 619, 620]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William A. Ketcham and A. S. Worthington for appellant.\n Messrs. Cassius C. Shirley, W. H. H. Miller, S. D. Miller, and W. H. Thompson for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n The primary question concerns the jurisdiction of this court to entertain this as a direct appeal from the district court.\n The decree below was rendered under a general creditors' bill, by which the assets of the Indianapolis, Crawfordsville, & Western Traction Company, an insolvent \n\n[234 U.S. 619, 621]\n\u00a0\n Indiana corporation, had been impounded, its debts ascertained, and the order of payment determined. Among the creditors proving their debts were some claiming liens. One was the Marion Trust Company, trustee under a general mortgage securing an issue of mortgage bonds. Another creditor was this appellant, the Moore-Mansfield Construction Company. That company had, under contract with the traction company, constructed a part of its line of railway, and for the balance of its debt claimed a lien upon its property. The decree from which this appeal was taken gave priority to the mortgage, and denied to appellant any lien upon the property of the traction company, and adjudged that its debt as fixed should be paid ratably out of the funds applicable to the payment of general debts.\n Counsel for appellant thus states the issue upon this appeal,-'The precise controversy presented by the record is: (a) Has the construction company a valid, subsisting, enforceable mechanics' lien under the laws of Indiana upon the railway property of the traction company? (b) Is such lien senior and paramount to the lien of the trust deed or mortgage given to secure the outstanding bonds?'\n The defense asserted to the mechanics' lien was that there was no statute giving to a contractor for railway construction a lien upon the railway property, and, second, if there existed any such lien, the construction company, for the purpose of giving security to the holders of the construction bonds, had expressly covenanted and agreed to waive and forego whatever right or rights it might have had at the time of the execution of its contract, or which it might thereafter acquire, to claim a lien against the property of the railway company under the laws of the state of Indiana.\n The court filed no opinion, but the decree recites that 'the construction company is not entitled to enforce a \n\n[234 U.S. 619, 622]\n\u00a0\n mechanics' lien against any of the property of said defendant traction company in the hands of the receiver of this court or elsewhere, if any; nor against the proceeds thereof; and that no such lien exists.'\n Thus, it is not clear whether the lien asserted was denied because of the waiver referred to, or because the statute of Indiana of March 6, 1883, being the statute under which the lien was claimed, did not embrace contractors. Appellant moved the court to amend the decree so as to make it more specific by stating whether it had no lien, because, under the law of Indiana, a contractor could acquire no such lien, or because it had waived its right to any such lien, as contended by the appellee. This motion was denied. We shall assume for the purpose of this case that the lien was denied upon the first ground stated, and upon that basis determine whether the case is one which can come direct to this court.\n That appellant could have carried this case for review to the circuit court of appeals is plain. The jurisdiction of the district court under the original bill was based only upon diversity of citizenship. Neither did the contention that, in the progress of the case, there arose a question claimed to involve the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States, deprive the unsuccessful party of the right to go to the circuit court of appeals, where all of the questions would be open to review. But the contention is that the appellant had an election to carry the case to the circuit court of appeals or bring it dircet to this court under  5 of the act of 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 827, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 549], now  247 of the Judicial Code of 1913 [36 Stat. at L. 1158, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 230], as a case 'which involved the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States.' Shortly stated the contention is, first, that under the decisions of the Indiana supreme court prior to the accruing of the rights of this appellant under its contracts, contractors were included within those who might, by compliance with \n\n[234 U.S. 619, 623]\n\u00a0\n the mechanics lien statute, secure liens; and, second, that the subsequent change of decision by which that court held that contractors were not included in the mechanics' lien law constituted a law which impaired the obligation of its contract within the meaning of the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States. It therefore assigns as error the action of the court below in not declaring the rights of appellant to be as they existed under the line of judicial decisions at the time such rights accrued.\n The title of the Indiana act of March 6, 1883, under which appellant claims to have acquired a lien, was 'an act concerning liens of mechanics, laborers, and materialmen.' A provision of the Constitution of Indiana,  19, article 4, provides that 'every act shall embrace but one subject and matters properly connected therewith, which subject shall be expressed in the title.' The contention is that for many years contractors had been regarded as entitled to a lien under this act and prior acts having a similar title, though it is conceded that the sufficiency of the title had never been expressly decided. On February 18, 1909, the Indiana supreme court in the case of Indianapolis Northern Traction Co. v. Brennan, 174 Ind. 1, 30 L.R.A. (N.S.) 85, 87 N. E. 215, 90 N. E. 65, 68, 91 N. E. 503, held that the act of 1883 did not include contractors or subcontractors. The act was not held to have been unconstitutionally enacted (Wilkes County v. Coler, \n180 U.S. 506\n, 45 L. ed. 642, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 458), nor that contractors and subcontractors might not have been included among those to whom the privilege of a lien was extended. The decree was confined to the single point that the title did not include contractors. It was therefore a mere construction of the act as not including obligations to contractors as distinguished from obligations to mechanics, labores, and materialmen. This is claimed to have been such a change of decision as to impair the obligation of the contract under which the appellant had constructed \n\n[234 U.S. 619, 624]\n\u00a0\n the railway of the traction company. Curiously enough, the supreme court of Indiana has, pending this appeal, retracted the construction it placed upon the act of 1883, and has held that contractors are within the intent and meaning of the act. Moore-Mansfield Constr. Co. v. Indianapolis, N. C . & C. R. Co. 179 Ind. 536, 44 L.R.A. (N.S.) 816, 101 N. E. 296. But a change in the opinion of a court as to the proper construction or scope of statute law of a state is not within article 1,  10, of the Constitution of the United States, which provides that 'no state shall . . . pass any bill of attainder,ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts.' That provision is a restraint upon the legislative power of the state, and, as was said by this court, 'it concerns the making of laws, not their construction by the courts. It has been so regarded from the beginning.' Ross v. Oregon, \n227 \nU.S. 150, 161\n, 57 S. L. ed. 458, 463, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 220. There had been no subsequent legislation which in anywise affected liens of contractors.\n It has been many times decided that a writ of error will not lie from this court to a state court under  709, Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575), on the ground that the obligation of a contract has been impaired by a change in the decision of the court in respect to the meaning and scope of a statute, the validity of which has not been denied. 'In order to come within the provision of the Constitution of the United States, which declares that no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts, not only must the obligation of a contract have been impaired, but it must have been impaired by some act of the legislative power of the state, and not by a decision of its judicial department only. The appellate jurisdiction of this court, upon writ of error to a state court, on the ground that the obligation of a contract has been impaired, can be invoked only when an act of the legislature alleged to be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States has been decided by the state court to be valid, and not \n\n[234 U.S. 619, 625]\n\u00a0\n when an act admitted to be valid had been misconstrued by the court.' Central Land Co. v. Laidley, \n159 \nU.S. 103, 109\n, 40 S. L. ed. 91, 93, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 80; see also Bacon v. Texas, \n163 \nU.S. 207, 220\n, 41 S. L. ed. 132, 137, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1023; Loeb v. Columbia Twp. \n179 \nU.S. 479, 493\n, 45 S. L. ed. 285, 291, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174; National Mut. Bldg. & L. Asso. v. Brahan, \n193 U.S. 635\n, 48 L. ed. 823, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 532. If, therefore, a mere change of decision by a state court in respect of the meaning and scope of a state statute, not claimed to be invalid or repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, does not constitute an impairment of a contract within the meaning of the contract clause of the Constitution, it must follow that a case otherwise within the jurisdiction of a district court of the United States, and reviewable in the circuit court of appeals, is not a case which may come direct to this court merely because, in the course of the case, a question arises touching the effect of such a change of decision upon the rights of the parties.\n Courts of the United States are courts of independent jurisdiction, and when a question arises in a United States court as to the effect of a change in decision which detrimentally affects contract rights and obligations entered into before such change, such rights and obligations should be determined by the law as judicially determined at the time the rights accrued. In every such case the Federal courts, while leaning to the view of the state court as to the validity or interpretation of a law of the state, will exercise an independent judgment, and will not necessarily follow state judicial decisions rendered subsequently. Burgess v. Seligman, \n107 \nU.S. 20, 33\n, 27 S. L. ed. 359, 365, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 10; Loeb v. Columbia Twp. \n179 \nU.S. 479, 493\n, 45 S. L. ed. 285, 291, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174.\n Under the settled rule it was the duty of the court below, when confronted with the question whether appellant had acquired a lien under the act of 1883, to determine for itself the meaning and scope of that act, and to declare the rights of that company under the law as it had been judicially determined. The decisions to this effect are \n\n[234 U.S. 619, 626]\n\u00a0\n numerous. Some of them are: Folsom v. Township Ninety-six, \n159 \nU.S. 611, 624\n, 40 S. L. ed. 278, 282, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174; Loeb v. Columbia Twp. supra; Jones v. Great Southern Fireproof Hotel Co. 30 C. C. A. 108, 58 U. S. App. 397, 86 Fed. 370, affirmed by this court in \n193 U.S. 532\n, 48 L. ed. 778, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 576. If the district court erred in following the later decision of the Indiana court, the error could have been corrected by the circuit court of appeals, and the judgment of the latter court might be reviewed by this court under a writ of certiorari. The cases of Folsom v. Township Ninety-six, and Jones v. Great Southern Fireproof Hotel Co. supra, reached this court through the circuit court of appeals, one by a certified request for an instruction, and the other by certiorari.\n The right to bring the case to this court from the district court by a direct appeal depended upon the question whether the decree denying to appellant the lien it claimed under the law of Indiana 'necessarily and directly involved the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States.' Empire State-Idaho Min. & Developing Co. v. Hanley, \n205 \nU.S. 225, 232\n, 51 S. L. ed. 779, 782, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 476. The change of decision in respect of the scope of the Indiana statutes was not a law of the state impairing the obligation of the contract, which is the only basis for the claim that the case is one which involved the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States. We are therefore precluded from an examination of the merits of the case (Cosmopolitan Min. Co. v. Walsh, \n193 U.S. 460\n, 48 L. ed. 749, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 489; Knop v. Monongahela River Consol. Coal & Coke Co. \n211 U.S. 485\n, 53 L. ed. 294, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 188), and the appeal must be dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Leave granted on June 22, 1914, to present petition for rehearing within thirty days. \n\n\n\n\n","147":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMULCREVY v. SAN FRANCISCO(1914)\nNo. 133\nArgued: Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. James F. Tevlin, Samuel M. Shortridge, and L. A. Redman for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. J. F. English and Percy V. Long for defendant in error. \n\n[231 U.S. 669, 670]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Action brought in the superior court of the city and county of San Francisco against plaintiffs in error, to recover from them the sum of $2, 972, with interest from certain dates, received by plaintiff in error Mulcrevy in his official capacity as county clerk and ex officio clerk of the superior court of the city and county of San Francisco in certain naturalization proceedings. Judgment was rendered on the pleadings against plaintiffs in error. It was affirmed on appeal.\n Mulcrevy was elected county clerk of the city and county of San Francisco at the November election, 1905, for the term of two years, commencing on January 8, 1906. He duly filed his official bond with plaintiff in error the Fidelity & Deposit Company of Maryland, his surety, which was conditioned that he should faithfully perform all official duties which were then or thereafter might be imposed upon him by law, ordinances, or the charter of the city and county. His salary was fixed by the charter at the sum of $4,000, and it was provided as follows: 'The salaries provided in this charter shall be in full compensation for all services rendered, and every officer shall pay all moneys coming into his hands as such officer, no matter from what source derived or received, into the treasury of the city and county of San Francisco within twenty- four hours after the receipt of the same.'\n By his election Mulcrevy became ex officio the clerk of the superior court. After he had entered upon the discharge of his duties, on the 29th of June, 1906, Congress passed an act entitled, 'An Act to Establish a Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization, and to Provide for a Uniform Rule for the Naturalization of Aliens Throughout the United States.' [34 Stat. at L. 596, chap. 3592, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 124.] Jurisdiction in naturalization proceedings was conferred by the act on the Fed- \n\n[231 U.S. 669, 671]\n\u00a0\n eral courts and certain state courts, and the duties of the clerks were set forth. Fees were prescribed, and it was provided that the clerks of the courts collecting them were authorized to retain one half thereof, the other half to be accounted for in their quarterly accounts which they were required to make to the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization. The amount retained by the clerk, however, it was provided should not exceed in any one fiscal year the sum of $3,000. If fees in excess of $6,000 be collected in any one year, the clerk might be allowed by the Secretary of Commerce and Labor additional compensation for additional clerical assistance out of the moneys received by the United States. \n Under the provisions of the act as clerk of the superior court in naturalization proceedings, Mulcrevy collected\n'Sec. 13. . . . The clerk of any court collecting such fees is hereby authorized to retain one half of the fees collected by him in such naturalization proceeding; the remaining one half of the naturalization fees in each case collected by such clecks, respectively, shall be accounted for in their quarterly accounts, which they are hereby required to render the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization . . .\n\n'Provided, That the clerks of courts exercising jurisdiction in naturalization proceedings shall be permitted to retain one half of the fees in any fiscal year up to the sum of three thousand dollars, and that all fees received by such clerks in naturalization proceedings in excess of such amount shall be accounted for and paid over to said Bureau as in case of other fees to which the United States may be entitled under the provisions of this act. The clerks of the various courts exercising jurisdiction in naturalization proceedings shall pay all additional clerical force that may be required in performing the duties imposed by this act upon the clerks of courts from fees received by such clerks in naturalization proceedings. And in case the clerk of any court collects fees in excess of the sum of six thousand dollars in any one year, the Secretary of Commerce and Labor may allow to such clerk from the money which the United States shall receive additional compensation for the employment of additional clerical assistance, but for no other purpose, if, in the opinion of said Secretary, the business of such clerk warrants such allowance.' \n\n[231 U.S. 669, 672]\n\u00a0\n $5,944, and accounted for one half thereof, as required by the act. The other half he kept for himself, his contention being that it was intended for himself by the act of Congress as pay for his extra work and clerical assistance, the fees not having been received by him in his official capacity, but merely as an agent designated by the act of Congress to perform services in naturalization proceedings.\n\n It appears from the opinion of the district court of appeal that the total salary list fixed and allowed to Mulcrevy's office amounts to $58, 600. And it is provided by the charter that when an officer shall require additional deputies, clerks, or employees, the same may be allowed by supervisors if, upon investigation, the mayor determines the same to be necessary.\n A question of jurisdiction is raised. From the judgment of the superior court the case was taken by appeal to the supreme court of the state, and properly taken, the latter court having jurisdiction, the amount involved being over $2,000. The supreme court, exercising the power given to it by the Constitution of the state, ordered the cause to be heard by the district court of appeal of the first appellate district of the state. The record was accordingly transmitted to the latter court, three printed copies, however, being retained in the supreme court. Upon the rendition of the judgment of the district court of appeal, affirming the judgment of the superior court, a petition was filed in the supreme court for transfer of the cause to it. The petition was denied as follows:\n By the court: The petition to have the above-entitled cause heard and determined by this court after judgment in the district court of appeal for the first appellate district is denied.\n Beatty, C. J.\n A petition for writ of error was then presented to the chief justice of the supreme court which recited that that court was the highest court of the state in which a \n\n[231 U.S. 669, 673]\n\u00a0\n decision of the cause could be had. The writ was allowed by the chief justice. A question was raised at the time as to which court the writ should run, and it seemed to be the opinion of the chief justice, as it was of counsel, that by the petition for transfer of the cause from the district court of appeal to the supreme court, the order of the latter court made the judgment final in that court. Though both counsel concur in this view, its correctness may be doubted. However, as this writ of error was allowed before the October term, 1912, of this court, the case is brought within Norfolk & S. Turnp. Co. v. Virginia, \n225 U.S. 264\n, 56 L. ed. 1082, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 828. In that case, under like circumstances, we did not dismiss the writ on our own motion, but entertained jurisdiction.\n On the merits the case presents no difficulty. It involves only the construction of the act of Congress already referred to above. We accept the state court's construction of the charter of the city and county of San Francisco. Indeed, its clearness leaves no room for construction. The salary it provides is declared to be 'in full compensation for all services rendered.' And it is provided that 'every officer shall pay all moneys coming into his hands as such officer, no matter from what source derived or received, into the treasury of the city and county.' The provisions are complete and comprehensive, and express Mulcrevy's contract with the city, the performance of which his office imposed upon him; and, of course, the fees received by him in naturalization proceedings, because he was clerk of the superior court, were in compensation for official acts, not personal acts.\n But it is contended by plaintiffs in error that the fees having been received officially is not of importance, that nevertheless he acted as the representative of the United States, in execution of the policies of the United States, and being by the act of Congress invested with his powers, he is entitled for himself to the compensation prescribed \n\n[231 U.S. 669, 674]\n\u00a0\n by the act for their execution, without any liability to account for them to the city. The last proposition, however, does not follow from the others, and the others are but confusing. If it be granted that he was made an agent of the national government, his relations to the city were not thereby changed. He was still its officer, receiving fees because he was,-not earning them otherwise or receiving them otherwise, but under compact with the city to pay them into the city treasury within twenty- four hours after their receipt.\n Under the contention of plaintiffs in error a rather curious situation is presented. Mulcrevy was elected to an office constituted by the municipality under the authority of the state. He was given a fixed salary of $4,000 with the express limitation that it should be his complete compensation. He agreed that all other moneys received by him officially should be paid into the treasury of the city. He was given office accommodations, clerks to assist him, and yet contends that notwithstanding such equipment and assistance, notwithstanding his compact, he may retain part of the revenues of his office as fees for his own personal use. We cannot yield to the contention. Nor do we think the act of Congress compels it. The act does not purport to deal with the relations of a state officer with the state. To so construe it might raise serious questions of power, and such questions are always to be avoided. We do not have to go to such lengths. The act is entirely satisfied without putting the officers of a state in antagonism to the laws of the state,-the laws which give them their official status. It is easily construed and its purpose entirely accomplished by requiring an accounting of one half of the fees to the United States, leaving the other half to whatever disposition may be provided by the state law. Counsel cite some state decisions which have construed the act of Congress as giving a special agency to the clerks of the state courts, and as receiving \n\n[231 U.S. 669, 675]\n\u00a0\n their powers and rights from the national enactment. The reports of the Department of Commerce and Labor are quoted from, which, it is contended, exhibit by their statistics and recommendations the necessity of national control. State decisions expressing a contrary view are frankly cited. This contrariety of opinion we need not further exhibit by a review of the cases. We have expressed our construction of the act, and it is entirely consonant with the purpose of the act and national control over naturalization.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","148":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMULLEN v. SIMMONS(1914)\nNo. 263\nArgued: Decided: June 8, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 192, 193]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. S. T. Bledsoe and J. R. Cottingham for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. J. E. Dolman and L. S. Dolman for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 192, 195]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Plaintiff in error brought suit in the district court in and for the seventh judicial district, Johnston county, state of Oklahoma, to restrain defendant in error, who was defendant in the trial court, from selling under execution issued upon a judgment obtained against one F. A. Bonner certain lands, which are described, belonging to plaintiff in error. He was plaintiff in the action, and we will so refer to him. Plaintiff, it is alleged, derived his title from F. A. Bonner by warranty deed dated October 17, 1908, Bonner then having unrestricted right to sell. Bonner is a member and citizen of the Choctaw Tribe of Indians, of one-sixteenth degree of Indian blood, and that the lands described constitute his allotment as a member and citizen of such tribe; that the judgment upon which the execution was issued was rendered and the debt evidenced by it contracted more than five years prior to the issuance of the execution, and at a time when the lands were inalienable, and that under the laws of the United States and the treaties between the Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations and the United States the lands were exempt from the operation of the judgment. That defendant threatens to sell the lands, and that a sale thereof and the deed which may be executed will cast a cloud upon plaintiff's title. A restraining order was issued. Defendant in his answer alleged that when the restraining order was served upon him, he was in possession of the lands under the execution which he set up as a defense. He admitted the other allegations of the plaintiff, and alleged that E. F. Ham et al., plaintiffs in the judgment, were necessary parties. He prayed a dissolution of the restraining order and that the suit be dismissed.\n Subsequently Millord F. Ham and others filed 'their interplea in said cause' and asked to be made defendants. \n\n[234 U.S. 192, 196]\n\u00a0\n For answer to plaintiff's petition they alleged the following: They recovered the judgment in controversy against Frank Bonner for the sum of $ 2,966.66 2\/3 on January 31, 1901, as damages for the killing of the husband of one of the interpleaders and the father of the others, upon which executions were issued, but all returned unsatisfied, and finally, on the 29th of September, 1908, the interpleaders caused the execution in controversy to be issued and levied upon the lands described in plaintiff's petition. On February 23, 1906, Bonner became the owner of the lands by allotment of the same as an Indian, and the judgment thereupon became a lien upon the lands. Subsequently that part of the Indian territory and the southern district where the lands are located became a part of what is now Johnston county, and the judgment is still a lien upon the lands and was a lien at the time of the purchase by Mullen, who, at the time of the alleged conveyance to him, had full knowledge and notice of the judgment, and knew that an execution had been issued and levied upon the lands, and that, therefore, he is not an innocent purchaser of them, but took them subject to the judgment.\n Mullen demurred to the answer of Simmons and to that of the interpleaders upon the grounds (1) that they did not constitute a defense. ( 2) They failed to show that the execution was a lien upon the lands, failed to show that the lands were seized by the sheriff prior to the deed to plaintiff, and failed to show that a lien attached by virtue of the execution. (3) The lands, having been taken in allotment by Bonner, were not subject under the law to any debt, deed, contract, or obligation of any character made prior to the time at which the lands could be alienated by the allottee; that the judgment was recovered against him more than five years before the lands were alienable, and that the lands were not subject to it or to the execution issued upon it.\n The judgment of the court was that it both overrule \n\n[234 U.S. 192, 197]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff's general demurrer and his first special demurrer . . . and doth sustain plaintiff's second special demurrer . . . and the interpleaders and the defendant elect to stand upon their answer and interplea herein, refuse to plead further, and the court finds for the plaintiff, and that he is entitled to the relief prayed for in his petition. . . .' And it was adjudged that the defendant Simmons, as sheriff of Johnston county, and his deputies, and the interpleaders, be enjoined and restrained forever from issuing or causing to be issued any execution or other process upon the judgment rendered against Frank Bonner in favor of the interpleaders, and from levying the same upon the lands described.\n The supreme court of the state reversed the judgment, deciding 'that the lien of interpleader's judgment attached to the allotment as soon as it came into being; that plaintiff took the land subject thereto, and that the same should be enforced and said land sold to satisfy the same, and that, too, notwithstanding the provisions of the 15th section of the act of July 1, 1902, which has no material bearing on the question.'\n The section referred to is as follows: 'Lands allotted to members and freedmen shall not be affected or encumbered by any deed, debt, or obligation of any character contracted prior to the time at which said land may be alienated under this act, nor shall said lands be sold except as herein provided.' [32 Stat. at L. 642, chap. 1362.]\n The supreme court of Oklahoma, in deciding that this provision did not apply, distinguished between the obligations resulting from an Indian's wrongful conduct and the obligations resulting from his contracts, saying: 'A judgment in damages for tort is not a 'debt contracted\" within the contemplation of  15. In other words, the court was of the view that the tort retained its identity, though merged in the judgment. However, we need not enter into the controversy of the cases and the \n\n[234 U.S. 192, 198]\n\u00a0\n books as to whether a judgment is a contract. Passing such considerations, and regarding the policy of  15 and its language, we are unable to concur with the supreme court of Oklahoma.\n This court said, in Starr v. Long Jim, \n227 \nU.S. 613, 625\n, 57 S. L. ed. 670, 675, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 358, that the title to lands allotted to Indians was 'retained by the United States for reasons of public policy, and in order to protect the Indians against their own improvidence.' It was held, applying the principle, that a warranty deed made by Long Jim at a time when he did not have the power of alienation 'was in the very teeth of the policy of the law, and could not operate as a conveyance, either by its primary force or by way of estoppel,' after he had received a patent for the land.\n The principle was applied again in Franklin v. Lynch, \n233 U.S. 269\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 505, and its strict character enforced against the deed of a white woman who acquired title in an Indian right. It is true, in these cases the act of the Indian was voluntary or contractual, and, it is contended, a different effect can be ascribed to the wrongs done by an Indian, and that in reparation or retribution of them the state law may subject his inalienable lands-inalienable by the national law-to alienation. The consequence of the contention repels its acceptance. Torts are of variable degree. In the present case that counted on reached, perhaps, the degree of a crime, but a tort may be a breach of a mere legal duty,-a consequence of negligent conduct. The policy of the law is, as we have said, to protect the Indians against their improvidence, and improvidence may affect all of their acts,-those of commission and omission, contracts and torts. And we think  15 of the act of July 1, 1902, was purposely made broadly protective, broadly preclusive of alienation by any conduct of the Indian, and not only its policy but its language distinguishes it from the statute passed on in Brun v. Mann, 12 L. R.A.(N.S.) 154, 80 C. C. A. 513, 151 Fed. 145. Its language is that 'lands allotted . . . \n\n[234 U.S. 192, 199]\n\u00a0\n shall not be affected or encumbered by any deed, debt, or obligation of any character contracted prior to the time at which' the lands may be alienated, 'nor shall said lands be sold except' as in the act provided. The prohibition, then, is that the lands shall not be 'affected . . . by any obligation of any character,' and, as we have seen, an obligation may arise from a tort as well as from a contract,-from a breach of duty or the violation of a right. Exchange Bank v. Ford, 7 Colo. 314, 316, 3 Pac. 449. If this were not so, a prearranged tort and a judgment confessed would become an easy means of circumventing the policy of the law.\n Judgment reversed and case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Mr. Justice Day dissents. \n\n\n\n","149":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMYERS v. PITTSBURGH COAL CO(1914)\nNo. 816\nArgued: February 27, 1914Decided: April 6, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 184, 185]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles K. Robinson, Edward C. Goodwin, and Frank H. Kennedy for petitioner.\n Messrs. Don Rose and Charles Marshall Johnston for respondent.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 184, 189]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n Annie Myers brought an action in the United States circuit court for the western district of Pennsylvania to recover for the death of her husband, John Myers, alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendant, the Pittsburgh Coal Company. Under the law of Pennsylvania she might bring this action for the benefit of herself and minor children. A verdict was rendered against the Coal Company; on writ of error the case was reversed by the circuit court of appeals for the third circuit (121 C. C. A. 427, 203 Fed. 221), and it was brought here on writ of certiorari to that court.\n The circuit court of appeals was of the opinion that upon the facts shown the plaintiff had not made out the right to recover, and the judgment was reversed without directing a new trial, and without sending the case back to the district court, which had succeeded to the jurisdiction of the circuit court, for that purpose. This was error within the doctrine of Slocum v. New York L. Ins. Co. \n228 U.S. 364\n, 57 L. ed. 879, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 523; Pedersen v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. \n229 \nU.S. 146, 153\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1125, 1128, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648, 3 N. C. C. A. 779. It is further contended that, apart from the question just noticed, the circuit court of appeals erred in reversing the judgment of the district court, as it did, upon the ground that there was not sufficient testimony in the case to show that the deceased came to his death by the negligence charged in the petition. To determine this question involves a brief consideration of the facts in the case. \n\n[233 U.S. 184, 190]\n\u00a0\n John Myers, at the time of his death, was, and for several months had been, in the employ of the Coal Company as 'snapper' or brakeman in underground operations, taking part in the movement of cars in and about the mine. It appears that on the morning of the injury, a train of empty coal cars, some thirty or forty in number, was being taken down the main entry and then further down a side entry into the mine, where the cars were to be subsequently distributed in the work. The manner of operation was that empty cars were hauled by a large electric motor car down the main entry to a side entry where a flying switch was made by which the motor car continued in the main entry beyond the junction of the side entry, and the cars ran down the side entry for a considerable distance, then, upon signal from Myers, whose duty it was to ride upon the rear car of the train, by the waving of his cap, which contained a lamp, or by the movement of his head with cap on, the motor car followed on down the entry, the purpose being to overtake the empty cars and distribute them in the mine. Down the side entry, about 157 feet from the main entry, was an automatic switch, which would turn the current into the trolley wire and permit the motor car to proceed farther into the mine. It was not working properly, and the motorman alighted and turned the switch by hand, returned to the motor car, and proceeded. Up to the time the motor car reached the automatic switch Myers had been seen signaling for the motor car to come on. Some distance further there was a branch of the trolley system running into another entry, and the trolley wire passed over the tracks in the side entry at a distance of about 5 feet, 7 1\/2 inches above the rail, making it necessary for one of ordinary height to remain seated in the car or to stoop down. The roof of the entry was about 9 feet above the rail at this point. There was no light at this switch, nor was the wire guarded in any \n\n[233 U.S. 184, 191]\n\u00a0\n way. It also appears that because of ineffective carbons the headlight on the motor car was not burning, and had not been burning for several days; that requisition had been made upon the superintendent of the mine for new carbons, but that there were none at the mine. The motorman testified that when the headlight was burning he could see objects on the track clearly at a distance of 25 or 30 yards, and that the could stop his car in about 13 feet. Continuing on from the switch, as we have said, the motor car suddenly ran upon something, was stopped, and it was found that Myers had been run over. He was lying in the middle of the track with his head toward the motor and his cap, upright, with the light still burning, was lying beside the track. Myers' body was badly torn and mangled before the motor car could be stopped. His tongue was found to be moving, but he shortly died from his injuries. It was also shown that Myers was a man of unusual strength and vigor, twenty-nine years of age, and to all appearances in full health and strength shortly before the injury.\n The trial court submitted the case to the jury to determine whether the defendant had failed to discharge its duty of using reasonable care to provide a proper and safe place for Myers to work; that is, in failing to provide adequate lights at a dangerous place, and permitting the motor car to be operated without the headlight, and also in permitting an exposed live trolley wire to cross the main track at insufficient elevation. An inspection of the record satisfies us that there was testimony enough in the case to carry these questions to the jury under the instructions which were given. The duty of the master to use reasonable diligence to provide a safe place for the employees to work, to carry on the occupation in which they are employed, is too well settled to require much consideration now. This duty is a continuing one, and discharged only when the master provides and maintains a place of that \n\n[233 U.S. 184, 192]\n\u00a0\n character. Baltimore & P. R. Co. v. Mackey, \n157 \nU.S. 72, 87\n, 39 S. L. ed. 624, 629, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 491; Union P. R. Co. v. O'Brien, \n161 U.S. 451\n, 40 L. ed. 766, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 618; Choctaw, O. & G. Co. v.

Under the case made, the jury might well have found that the overhead wire was hung too low for the safety of the men; that there was want of adequate light at this place; and that it was negligence to run the motor car into such a place without the light which it was its duty to provide. Where workmen are engaged in such mines in occupations more or less hazardous, it is the duty of the master to exercise reasonable care for their safety, and not to expose them to injury by use of dangerous appliances or unsafe places to work, when the exercise of due skill and care will make the appliances and places reasonably safe. Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. McDade, \n191 U.S. 66\n, 48 L. ed. 99, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 24, 15 Am. Neg. Rep. 230; Kreigh v. Westinghouse, C. K. & Co. \n214 U.S. 256\n, 53 L. ed. 988, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 619.\n The opinion of the circuit court of appeals placed the reversal largely upon the want of definite proof as to the manner in which Myers came to his death,-whether by contact with the wire, or, if so, whether that merely disabled him or he was only injured or stunned by the fall, was seized with vertigo or other sudden sickness and fell from the car for that reason, or lost his footing by some unexpected movement of the train, or voluntarily got off the car and stumbled and fell upon the track, or became bewildered in the dark, and mistakenly supposed himself to be in a place of safety. The court held that all these situations were more or less probable, and, in the absence of some more accurate means of ascertaining the true condition in this regard, no recovery could be had for the wrongful causing of his death, and that an examination of the testimony brought the court to the conclusion that the jury should not have been permitted to guess as to the proximate cause of death. This question, however, was submitted to the jury and found against the defendant in \n\n[233 U.S. 184, 193]\n\u00a0\n the trial court. Unless the testimony was such that no recovery can be had upon the facts shown in any view which can be properly taken of them, the verdict and judgment of the district court must be affirmed.\n That there was ample testimony to carry the question of negligence to the jury we have already said, and in any case it cannot be said as a matter of law that there was no evidence tending to show that Myers came to his death by the negligence of defendant in one or more of the ways charged in the petition. Considering the testimony, as it must be considered in determining questions of this character in appellate courts, in its most favorable aspect to the plaintiff below, we think the jury might well have found, in view of the place at which the body of Myers was found near to the wire, with his cap gone from his head, that he came in contact with that wire and was thrown to the ground, and that he survived from contact with the wire, carrying the voltage which it did, and while in this situation was run over and killed by the approaching motor car, the operator being unable to see his body upon the track because of the want of efficient light in the entry or in the motor car. We think reasonable men, considering the testimony adduced, might well have come to this conclusion, and that it was error in the appellate court to set aside the verdict for entire absence of testimony upon this subject. In our opinion, the trial court properly left the question to the jury upon testimony which, when fairly considered, might sustain the verdict. See Humes v. United States, \n170 U.S. 210\n, 42 L. ed. 1011, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 602.\n As to the contention that the trial court erred in refusing to give the instruction requested by the Coal Company to the effect that the equipment and operation of the electric haulage plant and all persons employed in the mine were in charge and subject to the orders and direction of a duly qualified mine foreman, and that, if decedent's death occurred by reason of negligence, such negligence \n\n[233 U.S. 184, 194]\n\u00a0\n was that of the mine foreman, and the Coal Company could not be held liable: The record shows that there was testimony tending to show that the electrical system was in charge of the electrician of the Coal Company employed as superintendent of electrical equipment, who had charge of the purchase, installation, care, operation, and maintenance of the electrical equipment used by the Company, and who was not subject to the mine foreman. The court submitted to the jury the question whether the Coal Company had committed to the mine foreman the electric system of hauling in the interior of the mine, or whether such system was in charge of an electrical engineer not accountable to the mine foreman, distinctly telling the jury that if the mine foreman was in charge in this respect, the company would not be responsible, but if they found that the Coal Company had excluded from the control of the mine foreman the electric haulage system, and that the negligence of the Coal Company was the direct and proximate cause of the death of the plaintiff's husband, there must be a recovery. The charge in this respect was as favorable as the company was entitled to have given.\n As to the objection that the court erred in failing to give the instruction requested by the defendant concerning the operation of the automatic switch, to the effect that if it did not work on the trip on which the decedent was run over, and even if it was out of order, those conditions would not contribute to the running over of the decedent by the motor car or to his death, it is sufficient to say that the court in its charge to the jury did not submit a question of negligence specifically concerning this automatic switch and its effect if out of repair, and to have affirmed this point by giving it to the jury would only have served to possibly confuse the jury upon a point immaterial to the plaintiff's recovery, in view of the manner in which the case was given in charge to the jury. \n\n[233 U.S. 184, 195]\n\u00a0\n We have examined the charge and the exceptions thereto and requests for instructions, and are of opinion that the trial court fairly submitted the questions involved to the jury in a charge to which there was no substantial objection.\n As to the suggestion that the deceased had assumed the risk of the want of proper appliances and the defective character of the light at the place in which he worked and was injured, we do not find that the court was requested to make any charge upon that subject, or that any exception was taken to the court's failure to charge as to assumption of risk. In that state of the record, the appellate court was not called upon to consider that question. See Humes v. United States, supra. The circuit court of appeals reversed the case for the reason, which we have stated, that there was an entire failure of adequate testimony to show that Myers came to his death by the negligence of the company in the manner charged. As we have said, we think that was an erroneous conclusion.\n It follows that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed, and the judgment of the District Court affirmed, and the case remanded to that court. \n\n\n\n","150":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNADAL v. MAY(1914)\nNo. 130\nArgued: Decided: April 20, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. N. B. K. Pettingill and F. L. Cornwell for plaintiff in error.[ Nadal v. May \n233 U.S. 447\n (1914) ]\n\n\n[233 U.S. 447, 449]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Felix Frankfurter and Mr. Wolcott H. Pitkin, Jr., Attorney General of Porto Rico, for defendant in error. \n\n[233 U.S. 447, 450]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit by the plaintiff in error to establish his title to one-half interest in a plantation called 'Carmen,' as devisee of his aunt, Altagracia Nadal. It is alleged that the plantation was bought with the separate money of Altagracia Nadal by her husband, after marriage; that she became the owner of one undivided half, subject to \n\n[233 U.S. 447, 451]\n\u00a0\n the administration of her husband until the termination of the conjugal partnership, and that this half passed to her devisee at her death. The complaint admits that after the purchase the husband purported to convey the whole plantation to a third person, but alleges that the wife did not consent to the conveyance, and that therefore her rights remained.\n It appears that on May 1, 1901, Altagracia Nadal brought a suit against her husband for an account of her paraphernal property, alleging, among other things, that he had recorded in his favor the estate Carmen, acquired by a deed of October 25, 1900, and praying judgment that it was her private property because bought with her separate funds, and for a cautionary notice to be entered in the registry. On November, 10, 1901, a settlement was made by which it was stated that the husband had received $ 10,000 as the product of the wife's paraphernal property, had paid her $5, 000 and given a mortgage for the other $5,000, and in view thereof, she 'renounces all the rights and interests which she might have against her husband because of the facts stated in the said complaint.' The instrument was presented to the court with a prayer that the court would hold that the parties had desisted from continuing the action and that the cautionary notice be canceled, which was granted on November 21. There had been conveyances of Carmen, without consideration, it was testified; there was a reconveyance to the husband, and on June 2, 1902, he conveyed it, without his wife's consent, to Elisa Sanjurjo, who, on August 29 of the same year, conveyed it to the people of Porto Rico, for valuable consideration, there being then no cautionary notice on record. On April 10, 1906, the wife assigned to the plaintiff the mortgage received by her on the above settlement, and on April 27, 1906, made the will under which the plaintiff claims.\n By this will the testatrix left to the plaintiff a mortgage \n\n[233 U.S. 447, 452]\n\u00a0\n described, with all its rights and actions (asi como todos sus derechos y acciones) and also the mortgage assigned on April 10, in case the assignment should not have been effective in favor of her said nephew Rafael Martinez y Nadal, todos los derechos y acciones que puedan caberme en los bienes mios que est em a nombre de mi esposo Isidro Fernandez Sanjurjo, en virtud de la transacci on celebrada con mi dicho esposo.\n The plaintiff's claim is founded on these last words. The official translation accepted by the court reads that she leaves the mortgage 'in case the assignment shall not have become effective, all the rights and actions which may pertain to me in my properties which are in the name of my husband Isidro Fernandez Sanjurjo, by virtue of the settlement made with my said husband.' The plaintiff contends that the word 'and' should be read in before 'all the rights and actions' on the notion that an y has dropped out or should be implied. He argues that the estate Carmen was not embraced in the settlement, because community property in which the wife had and retained a community interest, and that the last words devise it- en virtud de signifying more nearly in spite of the settlement than by virtue of it.\n On the other hand, it is argued that the settlement renounced all claim by the wife to Carmen, if any she had; that the last words of the will have an import similar to that of those used in connection with the previous mortgage; that en virtud de means by virtue of, that if the wife had a claim it was outside the settlement, and those words would not describe it, even if, at the date of the will, the estate had still stood in the husband's name, where notoriously, and as she well knew, it had not stood for years. The government also claims as a bona fide purchaser without notice. It is obvious, we think, from this summary, that these arguments against the plaintiff's claim are hard to meet, and they were not met. But it is \n\n[233 U.S. 447, 453]\n\u00a0\n not necessary absolutely to decide on their validity as the case is disposed of by a preliminary point.\n Both sides agree that the wife's assent to a conveyance by her husband was made necessary for the first time by  1328 of the Civil Code of March 1, 1902. Unless that Code went into effect at its date, it did not apply to the conveyance of June 2. The plaintiff argues with much force that it was in effect then, and that the decisions to the contrary are all based on a mistaken certificate of the Secretary of Porto Rico; but we are of opinion that the considerations on the other side must prevail. On the last day of its session the legislature passed four codes making material changes in the existing law,-the Political Code, the Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the Civil Code, which, although in form separate acts, were published in one volume and constituted a large part of a system. Two of these Codes fixed July 1, 1902, as the time for their taking effect. It was the duty of the Secretary to promulgate the laws (act of Congress of April 12, 1900, chap. 191,  19, 31 Stat. at L. 77, 81), and he was directed by an act of the same date as that of the Codes to revise and arrange the provisions of the Codes for publication along with the Joint Codes Committee of the legislature; the arrangement to be completed as soon as practicable after April 1, and publication being expected on or before August 1. A resolution of the day before shows that they had to be enacted before enrolment with manuscript corrections. Rev. Stat. & Codes of Porto Rico, 1902, p. 299. The Secretary certified that they were in effect on and after July 1, 1902. But the injustice of making the Civil Code operative before its contents could be known and before the revision contemplated by the law was so manifest that on February 24, 1903, an act was passed purporting to validate all conveyances of real estate and in general all acts that required certification by a notary executed after March 1, 1902, and on or before January 1, \n\n[233 U.S. 447, 454]\n\u00a0\n 1903, if they would have been valid by the laws in force on February 28, 1902. This court assumed that the Civil Code went into effect on July 1, in Ortega v. Lara, \n202 \nU.S. 339, 343\n, 50 S. L. ed. 1055, 1056, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 707, and the supreme court of Porto Rico has decided the same point twice. Morales v. Registrar of Property, 16 P. R. R. 109, 114; Bus o v. Bus o, 18 P. R. R. 864, 867, 868. It is impossible to know how many or how important transactions may have taken place on the faith of these repeated solemn assurances, and apart from the general unwillingness of this court to overrule the local tribunals upon matters of purely local concern ( Sante F e C. R. Co. v. Friday, \n232 \nU.S. 694, 700\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 468), it is not too much to say that the decisions have become a rule of property, even if we did not think, as we do, that probably the Secretary's certificate expressed the legislative will.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL SAFE DEPOSIT CO. v. STEAD(1914)\nNo. 138\nArgued: December 16, 1913Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n By the act of July 1, 1909, the Illinois legislature passed an inheritance tax law like that considered in Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Sav. Bank, \n170 U.S. 283\n, 42 L. ed. 1037, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 594. The 9th section of the statute provides in substance:\n That no safe deposit company, corporation, or person \n\n[232 U.S. 58, 59]\n\u00a0\n having in possession or under control securities or assets belonging to or standing in the name of a decedent, or in the joint name of the decedent and another person, or in the name of a partnership of which he was a member, shall deliver such assets to the legal representative of the deceased or to the survivor of the joint holders, or to the partnership of which he was a member, without ten days' notice to the attorney general and treasurer of the state, who were authorized to examine the securities at the time of the delivery. It was further provided that no delivery should be made unless such holder should retain a sufficient portion of the assets to pay the state tax thereafter assessed, unless such state officers gave consent in writing. Failure to give the notice or to retain such amount rendered the deposit company, corporation, or person liable for the tax and to a penalty of $1,000.\n On March 15, 1910, the National Safe Deposit Company filed in the circuit court of Cook county, Illinois, a bill against the treasurer and attorney general, alleging that the company was incorporated in 1881 to do a safe deposit business, and that, in pursuance of its charter, it had erected a building with large vaults into which 13,291 safe deposit boxes had been built and 9,702 rented,-317 to partnerships and 4,104 were held jointly by more than one person. That prior to July 1, 1909, it had made yearly contracts for the rental of said boxes, most of which were still of force. The rent contracts recited that in consideration of $_____ paid, the company 'had rented to _____ safe No. ___ in the vaults of this company for the term of one year,' and that its liability was limited to the exercise of ordinary diligence in preventing the opening of the safe by any person other than the renter or his duly authorized representative. 'No one except the renter, or his deputy, to be designated in writing on the books of the company, or, in case of death, his legal representative, to have access to the safe' . . . No renter will be \n\n[232 U.S. 58, 60]\n\u00a0\n permitted to enter the vaults except in the presence of the vault keeper. In case of loss of key or combination the lock will be changed at the expense of the renter. . . .\n The bill alleged that the safes could be opened only by two keys, or two combinations, one of which keys or combinations was held by or known only to the renter, the other being held or known only by the company's agents. So that it required the joint act of the customer and the company to secure access to the contents,-the company having no right or means of access to the box itself, nor did it possess any knowledge or information as to the ownership of the securities deposited therein.\n The bill further alleged that, notwithstanding these facts, the defendants insisted that the Deposit Company had such possession or control of the contents as to make it incumbent upon it to prevent access thereto by all persons for ten days after the death of the sole or joint renter; that this deprived the Deposit Company of the right to do the business for which it had been chartered, made it break its contract that it would allow no one except the renter or his agent or representative to have access to the boxes; interfered with its business by depriving the representative and survivor of their right to use the box and contents; imposed upon the Deposit Company the risk of determining who was the owner of the contents of the box, and imposed the duty of acting as a tax- collecting agent for the state. The bill also alleged that the company had been threatened with suits by depositors if it yielded to the command of such void act. In order to prevent a multiplicity of suits, and to avoid the heavy statutory penalties, the company prayed that the defendants be enjoined from enforcing the statute against it.\n The defendants' demurrer was sustained. That ruling was affirmed by the supreme court of Illinois, three judges dissenting (250 Ill. 584, 95 N. E. 973, Ann. Cas. 1912 B, 430). The case was then brought here by writ of error. \n\n[232 U.S. 58, 61]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George Packard, John S. miller, and Merritt Starr for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 58, 64]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Patrick J. Lucey and Lester H. Strawn for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Lamar:\n\n\n[232 U.S. 58, 66]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The Illinois inheritance tax law operates to seal safe \n\n[232 U.S. 58, 67]\n\u00a0\n deposit boxes for at least ten days after the death of the renter. In view of the uncertainty as to who might own the contents of boxes standing in the joint name of the deceased and others, the statute sealed their boxes also for a like period. The act further provided that in neither case could the securities be removed except after notice to officers designated by the state, and even then the company was required to retain possession of enough of the assets to pay the state's tax. The Deposit Company insists that this statute violated the 14th Amendment, for that, without due process of law, it imposed upon the company a duty as to property over which it had no control; required it to assume the risk of determining who was the true owner, and forced upon it the obligations and liabilities of a tax-collecting agent of the state. In the court below and on the argument here, the validity of the section under review was said to depend upon the relation between the company and the renter,-it being argued for the state that the contract was one of bailment where, on the death of the bailor, the Deposit Company, as bailee, was bound to surrender the securities to the owner or person having a right thereto, one of whom, in each case, was the state to the extent of its tax. On the other hand, the complainant insisted that if there was no possession in fact, there could be no possession in law; and that if no possession existed, it was beyond the power even of the legislature to charge the company with liabilities that could only arise out of a possession actually existing.\n This is one of that class of cases which illustrate the fact that, both in common speech and in legal terminology, there is no word more ambiguous in its meaning than possession. It is interchangeably used to describe actual possession and constructive possession which often so shade into one another that it is difficult to say where one ends and the other begins. Union Trust Co. v. Wilson, \n198 U.S. 537\n, 49 L. ed. 1156, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 766. Custody may be in the servant and pos- \n\n[232 U.S. 58, 68]\n\u00a0\n session in the master; or title and right of control may be in one and the property within the protection of the house of another, as in Bottom v. Clarke, 7 Cush. 489, where such possession of a locked trunk was held not to include possession of the contents. So that, as pointed out by Pollock and Wright in their work on the subject, controversies arising out of mixed possession have inevitably, led to many subtle refinements in order to determine the rights of conflicting claimants, or to lay the proper charge of ownership in prosecutions for larceny of goods belonging to one, in the custody of another, or found by the defendant.\n In the present case, however, the Federal question presented by the record does not call for a decision as to the exact relation between the parties during the life of the renter,-whether there was a strict bailment; whether the renter was in possession of the box with the Deposit Company as guard over the contents; whether the property was in the custody of the company with the renter having a license to enter the building and remove the securities; or whether, as held in People ex rel. Glynn v. Mercantile Safe Deposit Co. (159 App. Div. 98, 143 N. Y. Supp. 849), construing a similar statute of New York, the relation was that which exists between tenants and landlord of an office building who keeps under his control the general means of access to the building and offices therein, but as to which offices and their contents, the rights of the tenants are exclusive. The Illinois supreme court held that the relation created by the Deposit Company's contract was that of bailor and bailee. That construction by the state court is controlling, unless, as claimed by the complainant, it makes the statute violate the 14th Amendment, as being an arbitrary attempt to create liabilities arising out of possession, where there was no possession in fact.\n Certainly the person who rented the box was not in actual possession of its contents. For the valuables were \n\n[232 U.S. 58, 69]\n\u00a0\n in a safe built into the company's vault, and therefore in a sense 'under the protection of the house.' The owner could not obtain access to the box without being admitted to the vault, nor could he open the box without the use of the company's master key. Both in law, and by the express provisions of the contract, the company stood in such relation to the property as to make it liable if, during the lifetime of the owner, it negligently permitted unauthorized persons to remove the contents, even though it might be under color of legal process. Roberts v. Stuyvesant Safe Deposit Co. 123 N. Y. 57, 9 L.R.A. 438, 20 Am. St. Rep. 718, 25 N. E. 294, 1 Am. Neg. Cas. 535; Mayer v. Brensinger, 180 Ill. 110, 72 Am. St. Rep. 196, 54 N. E. 159. After his death, it would be likewise liable if it permitted unauthorized persons, be they heirs, legal representatives, or joint renters, to take the property of the decedent. In the exercise of its power to provide for the distribution of his property, the state could make it unlawful, except on conditions named, for his personal representative to receive or the holder to deliver, effects belonging, or apparently belonging, in whole or in part, to the deceased. As the state could provide for the appointment of administrators, for the distribution to heirs or legatees of all the property of the deceased, and for the payment of a tax on the transfer, it could, of course, legislative as to the incidents attending the collection of the tax and the time when the administrator or executor could take possession. If, before representatives were appointed, anyone, having the goods in possession or control, delivered them to an unauthorized person, he would be held liable as an executor de son tort. The fixing by this statute of the time and condition on which delivery might be made by a deposit company was also, in effect, a limitation on the right of the heir or representatives to take possession. If they had no right to receive except on compliance with the statutory conditions, neither could the Safe Deposit Company, as bailee or custodian, surrender the contents except upon like compliance with statutory conditions. \n\n[232 U.S. 58, 70]\n\u00a0\n The contention that the company could not be arbitrarily charged with the duty of supervising the delivery and determining to whom the securities belonged is answered by the fact that in law and by contract it had such control as to make it liable for allowing unauthorized persons to take possession. Both by the nature of its business and the terms of its contract it had assumed the obligation cast upon those having possession of property claimed by different persons. If the parties could not agree as to who owned the securities, the company had the same remedy by bill of interpleader that was afforded all others confronted with similar conditions. There was certainly nothing arbitary or unreasonable in compelling one who had received such control of property from another, to surrender it after his death only to those having the right thereto. Nor was there any deprivation of property, nor any arbitrary imposition of a liability, in requiring the company to retain assets sufficient to pay the tax that might be due to the state. There are many instances in which, by statute, the amount of the tax due by one is to be reported and paid by another,-as in the case of banks required to pay the tax on the shares of a stockholder. First Nat. Bank v. Kentucky, 9 Wall. 363, 19 L. ed. 704. These conclusions answer the other constitutional objections and make it unnecessary to deal with each of them separately at length.\n It is contended that the statute impaired the complainant's charter power to do a safe deposit business. But it no more interferes with the right of the company to do that business than it does with the right of a private person to contract to take possession or control of securities belonging to another. But, having regard to the radical change wrought by the death of the owner, and the subsequent duty to make delivery to one authorized by law to receive possession, the statute points out when and on what conditions such delivery may be made to the per- \n\n[232 U.S. 58, 71]\n\u00a0\n sonal representative, surviving partners, or persons jointly interested.\n The objection that the act, in directing the state officers to inspect the contents of the box, operates as an unreasonable search and seizure, raises no Federal question, since the prohibition on that subject in the 4th Amendment does not apply to the states. Ohio ex rel. Lloyd v. Dollison, \n194 U.S. 447\n, 48 L. ed. 1065, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 703.\n The claim that the statute compels the company to break its contract with joint renters and deprives the latter, for ten days, of access to the box and the right to use it or remove the contents, is without merit. The company, joint renters, or firms, each made the contract in the light of the state's power to legislate for the protection of the estate of any one of the joint renters or partners that might die during the term. As it now appears that all of the rentals were from year to year, and that all had expired before final hearing, and were renewed after the passage of the law, it can also be said that all such contracts of joint rental are made in the light of the provisions of this particular statute. The boxes were leased with the knowledge that the state had so legislated as not only to protect the interests of one dying after the rental, but also to secure the payment of the state tax out of whatever might be found in the box belonging to the deceased. The inconvenience was one of the not unreasonable incidents of the joint relationship.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Laws 1909, p. 316,  9. \n\n\n\n\n","152":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW ORLEANS & N E R.

The rice was shipped upon through bills of lading issued by the initial carrier, and was destroyed while in the second carrier's custody at Old Hamburg, South Carolina. The two cars, with others \n\n[234 U.S. 80, 82]\n\u00a0\n containing quicklime, were side-tracked in the yard at that place awaiting further movement towards their destination. The yards adjoined the Savannah river, which was then almost out of its banks and steadily rising as a result of extraordinary rains and cloudbursts extending up the river and its tributaries 100 miles. The waters continued to rise, spread over the yard to a considerable depth, and ultimately reached the quicklime, thereby causing the cars to burn and destroying the rice. The cars had been in the yard about sixteen hours when the fire started. The action was against both carriers, and it was alleged in the petition, which based the right of recovery upon the Carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act (34 Stat. at L. 584, 595, chap. 3591,  7, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1307), that the loss of the rice was caused by the negligence of the second carrier, and that the two carriers were jointly liable. Issue was joined, and, after a trial, the district court of the parish rendered a judgment against the carriers jointly and in solido, which the supreme court of the state at first reversed, and then, after a rehearing, affirmed. 132 La. 615, 61 So. 708. The carriers sued out this writ of error, basing their right so to do upon a claim that by the judgment of affirmance they were denied a right or immunity asserted under a law of the United States.\n A motion to dismiss was presented along with the merits, and we think it is well taken.\n The bills of lading contained these stipulations:\n'This company or other carriers over whose line the property may pass shall not be held responsible for loss or damage (unless through proved carelessness or negligence of their employees) resulting . . . from heat, cold, fire, flood, storms, mobs, or other causes not subject to the carrier's control.\n\n'Neither this company nor any of its connecting carriers shall be liable for any damage to or destruction of \n\n[234 U.S. 80, 83]\n\u00a0\n said property by fire, unless such damage or destruction shall result directly and exclusively from their negligence or that of their employees, and unless such negligence shall be affirmatively established by the owner of said property.'\n\n In the supreme court of the state the carriers contended that, under the combined operation of the Carmack amendment as interpreted in Adams Exp. Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, 57 L. ed. 314, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 257, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148, the stipulations in the bills of lading, and the common-law rule applied in Memphis & C. R. Co. v. Reeves, 10 Wall. 176, 19 L. ed. 909, and other cases, they were entitled to exoneration upon showing that the rice was destroyed by the extraordinary flood, unless it also was shown that the second carrier contributed to the loss by negligently failing to take reasonable precautions to avoid it when the rising waters gave warning of the danger; and it was particularly urged as a part of this contention that the burden was upon the plaintiff to show such negligence, and not upon the carriers to show the absence of it. But the court, although disapproving the latter phase of the contention, and thinking the carriers were charged by the law of Louisiana with the burden of showing that there was no negligence, did not rest its judgment upon that ground. On the contrary, it examined the evidence, which comprehensively covered the subject, to ascertain whether, upon the hypothesis that the contention of the carriers was sound, they were liable, and from that examination it found as matter of fact that the second carrier had negligently permitted the cars of rice to remain within the influence of the rising flood and in immediate proximity to the quicklime when ordinary prudence required that they be moved to a place of safety; and that this was\n Clark v.

Rep. 659. \n\n[234 U.S. 80, 84]\n\u00a0\n made an independent ground of the judgment is shown by the court's extended discussion of the evidence and by the following excerpts from its opinion:\n'A close reading of the evidence compels the conclusion that there was not sufficient forethought on the part of the officers in charge of the railroad yards. We have seen that the river was rising rapidly on the morning of the 26th of August. Some of the witness testified that by 7 o'clock it had covered the switch tracks, and yet nothing was done to protect property. Leisurely enough, the employees went about their business and gave very little concern to the rising waters. Those who did attempt to save property (if what they did can be considered in that light) displayed very little activity, beginning at 8 o'clock, taking out a few cars and leaving others in the old Hamburg yards. That is all they did. These yards were submerged by water to a height above the floor of the cars. The question arises: Was it possible, before the waters reached their greatest height, to move the cars to a safer place than where they were hauled to on the morning of the 26th of August; that is, to the old Hamburg yards? We have noted, before 8 o'clock or 8:30 o'clock A. M., not the least attempt was made to move the cars out of the yard where they had been placed. Mr. Benson, inspector of the Southern Railway Company, testified that on the morning of the 26th of August, he reported at the Hamburg yard at 7 o'clock to go to work, and at that time the water had just reached the rail in front of the block office. There were a crew and an engine in the yard. Why were they not put at that time to were they not put at work at that time to\n\n'Another witness, the night operator, renders it still more evident that it was possible to move the train in the morning, for he says that when he went to work the yard was entirely free from water on the 26th of August in the morning. An attempt was made to rescue the cars between 8 and half past 8 o'clock A. M. It failed. They \n\n[234 U.S. 80, 85]\n\u00a0\n went too late to rescue these cars. There had been ample time to save them.\n\n ... * *\n'These floods were frequent, and yet defendant remained indifferent, and even sent its cars to the lowest places on the yard, where they were permitted to remain without making a serious and timely attempt to take them away.\n\n'From all this evidence we are led to the inference, which we think is positive, that there was negligence. A little timely activity would have brought about a different result, and would have saved plaintiff's property, or would have placed defendant in a position to successfully defend itself.\n\n'Unquestionably the river was rising rapidly on the morning of the 26th at 7 o'clock; in thirty-five minutes it covered the switch tracks. It does not seem that anything was done to prevent the destruction of the cars. Leisurely enough, the employees went about their respective occupations, and now, when they give an account of themselves, it does seem as if they wish to lay all the trouble on the rising waters, although they remained indifferent when they should have exerted themselves.\n\n ... * *\n'Admitting for a moment all that is claimed under the Carmack amendment, under any of the laws of this country, indifferent railroad people, who receive freight to be transported some distance, and who, just befor the waters of a storm have flowed down, stop the cars on the way, and run them to the lowest part of their yards, and place them next to cars loaded with quicklime, easily ignited by water, and leave them at that place while other cars are taken out, and who make no attempt to naul them out, although the waters are rising slowly enough for such work after warning given, are not protected from the charge of negligence under the law.' \n\n[234 U.S. 80, 86]\n\u00a0\n True, the testimony upon which the court rested its conclusion that negligence was proved did not come from the plaintiff's witnesses, but from those for the carriers, and was largely elicited by cross-examination, but that is quite immaterial. The plaintiff was entitled to the benefit of all the testimony in the case, from whatever source it came, and was not required, even though having the burden of proof, to go through the ceremony of proving any fact otherwise established.\n\n As it clearly appears that the judgment rested upon a ground which was not only adequate to sustain it, but in entire harmony with the carrier's asserted Federal right, it cannot be said that there was a denial of that right in the sense contemplated by  237 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 227 ]. Whether the right was well founded we therefore need not consider.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","153":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK ELECTRIC LINES CO. v.

Under the authority of a statute passed in the next year (Laws of 1885, chap. 499, amended by Laws of 1886, chap. 503), the board of commissioners of electric subways adopted a plan by which the city of New York should enter into a contract with a company to construct the necessary subways, etc., which other companies operating electrical wires should be compelled to use, paying therefor a reasonable rent. Under contracts made accordingly and ratified by the legislature ( Laws of 1887, chap. 716), subways, etc., were constructed by the Consolidated Telegraph & Electrical Subway Company. The board first mentioned was succeeded by the board of electrical control (Laws of 1887, chap. 716); and, in 1890, the subways, conduits, and ducts for low tension conductors, which had been thus provided, were transferred to the Empire City Subway Company (Limited), the de- \n\n[235 U.S. 179, 186]\n\u00a0\n fendant in error. The latter company, by contract with the board and the city, made in 1891, under legislative authority (Laws of 1891, chap. 231), agreed to build, maintain, and operate subways, etc., as specified-it being provided that spaces therein, upon application, should be leased 'to any company or corporation having lawful power to operate telegraph or telephone conductors in any street' in the city of New York.\n The plaintiff in error, the New York Electric Lines Company, claiming to be entitled to space in these subways, made application therefor on or about June 10, 1910. The request was refused and the present proceeding for a peremptory mandamus was brought. The assertion of right rested upon a permission granted by the city of New York, through its common council, to the plaintiff in error, on April 10, 1883, to lay electrical conductors in the city's streets. This permission, the city, by its board of estimate and apportionment, which had succeeded to the powers of the former common council in the matter, had formally revoked by a resolution adopted on May 11, 1906, reciting that whatever rights the company had secured under the permission in question had long since been forfeited by nonuser. The court of appeals of the state, holding that the board of estimate and apportionment had this power of revocation, and had duly exercised it, affirmed an order refusing the writ of mandamus. 201 N. Y. 321, -- L.R.A.( N.S.) --, 94 N. E. 1056. The plaintiff in error insists that the resolution thus sustained was an unconstitutional impairment of the obligation of its contract with the city.\n We think that it sufficiently appears that this question was raised in the state court, and as the state court gave effect to the repealing resolution the case is properly here. It is therefore the duty of this court to determine for itself whether a contract existed and whether its obligation has been impaired. Douglass v. Kentucky, \n168 \nU.S. 488, 502\n, 42 S.

Rep. 62].\n The plaintiff in error was incorporated in the year 1882, under a general law of the state of New York (Laws of 1848, chap. 265, as amended by Laws of 1853, chap. 471). Its certificate of incorporation stated, among other things, that it was incorporated for the purpose of 'owning, constructing, using, maintaining, and leasing lines of telegraph wires or other electric conductors for telegraphic and telephonic communication and for electric illumination, to be placed under the pavements of the streets . . . of the cities of New York and Brooklyn,' and 'for the purpose of owning franchises for laying and operating the said lines of electric conductors.' Chapter 483 of the Laws of 1881 had authorized any company so incorporated 'to construct and lay lines of electrical conductors underground in any city,' provided that it 'first obtain from the common council' of such city the 'permission to use the streets' for the purposes set forth. The permission in question, which, as already stated, was granted by the common council of the city of New York, on April 10, 1883, was (omitting parts not here material) as follows:\n'Resolved, that permission be and hereby is granted to the New York Electric Lines Company, to lay wires or other conductors of electricity, in and through the streets, avenues, and highways of New York city, and to make connections of such wires or conductors underground by means of the necessary vaults, test boxes, and distributing conduits, and thence above ground with points of electric illuminations or of telegraphic or telephone signals in accordance with the provisions of an ordinance . . . approved . . . December 14, 1878.'\n\n It was also resolved that the company should not \n\n[235 U.S. 179, 188]\n\u00a0\n 'transfer or dispose of the franchise hereby granted without the further authority of the common council.'\n On April 24, 1883, the plaintiff in error presented to the common council, and the latter spread upon its minutes, a formal acceptance of the permission, which, after the recitals, states:\n'Now, therefore, the said New York Electric Lines Company by these presents accepts the said franchise as contained in the ordinance and resolutions adopted by the honorable the board of aldermen, April 10, 1883, and agrees to, assumes, and obligates itself in the observance of all the requirements, provisions, restrictions, conditions, and limitations contained in the said lastmentioned ordinance as adopted April 10, 1883, as well also as to the provisions, conditions, and obligations of said general ordinance approved by the mayor December 14th, 1878.'\n\n The ordinance of 1878, referred to, regulated the method of laying wires under the streets, and provided that within six months after the grant of permission, grantees should file with the county clerk 'maps, diagrams, and tabular statements indicating the amount and position of the spaces proposed to be occupied by them.' In May, 1883, the plaintiff in error, in asserted compliance with the ordinance, filed a map, diagrams, and statement. It is alleged in the affidavits presented on the application for mandamus that the plaintiff in error secured inventions and patent rights, that it had an office and factory, that it prosecuted experimental work in relation to its project, and expended in this way large sums of money. But, in the actual construction of conduits or laying of wires, nothing was done prior to the legislation of 1885 and 1886, which, as we have seen, provided for a comprehensive plan for the building of subways in which electrical conductors should be placed.\n Section 3 of the act of 1885 expressly made it obligatory upon any company 'operating or intending to operate elec- \n\n[235 U.S. 179, 189]\n\u00a0\n trical conductors,' and desiring or being required to place its conductors underground, to file with the board of commissioners a 'map or maps, made to scale,' showing the proposed plan of construction of its underground electrical system, and 'to obtain the approval by said board of said plan' before any underground conduits should be constructed. The plaintiff in error did not submit a plan to the board as required by the statute. In July, 1886, it applied to the commissioner of public works for a permit to make the necessary excavations in the streets for the purpose of laying conductors, and, on the application being denied, petitioned for a writ of peremptory mandamus to direct the commissioner to grant it. It was insisted in its petition in that proceeding that it had 'never operated or intended to operate electrical conductors,' its intention having always been 'to lease to other persons, natural or corporate, all of its electrical conductors, and not to operate itself any' of them; that the acts of 1885 and 1886 (above mentioned), relating to the construction of subways, did not apply to the plaintiff in error; and that, if they were applicable, they violated the Federal Constitution, being an impairment of its contract with the city, and operating to deprive the plaintiff in error of its property without due process of law. The state court held that the statutes in question were applicable to the plaintiff in error, and were constitutional, and refused the mandamus. People ex rel. New York Electric Lines Co. v. Squire, 107 N. Y. 593, 1 Am. St. Rep. 893, 14 N. E. 820.\n This court affirmed the judgment (id. \n145 U.S. 175\n, 36 L. ed. 666, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 880), saying (pp. 187, 188):\n'In no sense of the term do we think it can be safely averred that the acts of 1885 and 1886 are not applicable to the relator. . . . Neither can it be said that the acts of 1885 and 1886 have a retroactive effect, at least, so far as the relator is concerned, since whatever rights it obtained under the ordinance of 1883, which it accepted \n\n[235 U.S. 179, 190]\n\u00a0\n as the basis of the contract it claims to have entered into, were expressly subject to regulation, in their use, by the highest legislative power in the state, acting for the benefit of all interests affected by those rights, and for the benefit of the public generally, so long as the relator's essential rights were not impaired or invaded. New Orleans Gaslight Co. v. Louisiana Light & H. P. & Mfg. Co. \n115 U.S. 650\n, 29 L. ed. 516, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 252; Stein v. Bienville Water Supply Co. \n141 U.S. 67\n, 35 L. ed. 622, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 892.'\n\n And conceding, for the purpose of the discussion, but 'without deciding,' that the plaintiff in error had a contract with the city 'for the laying of its wires, and the construction of its underground electrical system,' this court reached the conclusion that its rights had in no way been impaired by the legislation under review.\n This decision was rendered in May, 1892. Meanwhile, pursuant to the statutes above mentioned, a plan of construction had been adopted by the board charged with that duty, subways had been built, and the defendant in error had entered into its contract to maintain and operate those for low tension conductors, as specified, including telegraph and telephone conductors. But for fifteen years after the final decision in the case cited no application was made by the plaintiff in error for space in these subways. The first application for such space was made in June, 1907, and was not granted.\n Nor, during this long period, was any attempt made by the plaintiff in error either to build conduits or to place wires under the city's streets, save that in December, 1905, it applied to the commissioner of water supply, gas, and electricity for a permit to open the streets for that purpose, and, on its being denied, a proceeding was begun to obtain a peremptory writ of mandamus. This was refused, and the order to that effect was affirmed by the court of appeals of the state. People ex rel. New York Electric Lines Co. v. Ellison, 188 N. Y. 523, 81 N. E. 447. The pertinent legislation and the subway contracts were reviewed, and \n\n[235 U.S. 179, 191]\n\u00a0\n the requirement that electrical conductors should be placed in conduits constructed in accordance with the adopted plan, instead of the plaintiff in error being permitted to build its own subways for such conductors, was sustained. In arriving at this result, it was again assumed that the plaintiff in error had a continuing right under the city's permission, but this question was expressly reserved (id. p. 527). A writ of error sued out from this court was dismissed on motion of the plaintiff in error. \n214 U.S. 529\n, 53 L. ed. 1069, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 695.\n It was about the time when the lastmentioned proceeding was instituted that the city's permission was revoked (May 11, 1906); and the state court, in its opinion in the present case, said that the question 'remaining to be determined' was whether 'the relator, under the resolution of the common council of April, 1883, has the right, as a matter of law, to have its wires inserted in the ducts of the Empire City Subway Company, notwithstanding the revocation of such resolution.' Did a 'bare acceptance' of the permission operate to vest an irrevocable franchise? 201 N. Y. p. 329, -- L.R.A.(N.S.) --, 94 N. E. 1056. This question was answered in the negative in the view that such a permission is 'a license merely, revocable at the pleasure of the city, unless it has been accepted and some substantial part of the work performed,' as contemplated by the permission, 'sufficient to create a right of property and thus form a consideration for the contract.'\n The plaintiff in error challenges this view, insisting that, by virtue of the city's permission, it is the grantee of an irrevocable franchise in the city's streets; that this franchise was derived from the state; that when the consent of the city was given, as provided in the statute, the grant became immediately operative and could not thereafter be revoked or impaired by municipal resolution or ordinance; that the granted right, however named, is property,-and, as such, is inviolable; and that this position is \n\n[235 U.S. 179, 192]\n\u00a0\n supported by numerous decisions both of the state court and of this court, which are cited in the margin. \n1\n Thus, in Ghee v. Northern Union Gas Co. 158 N. Y. 510, 513, 53 N. E. 692, referring to the legal effect of the consent of the municipal authorities under a statute empowering the corporation to lay gas conduits in streets, on such consent, the court said: 'It operates to create a franchise by which is vested in the corporation receiving it a perpetual and indefeasible interest in the land constituting the streets of a municipality. It is true that the franchise comes from the state, but the act of the local authorities, who represent the state by its permission and for that purpose, constitutes the act upon which the law operates to create the franchise.' And in Louisville v. Cumberland Teleph. & Teleg. Co. \n224 \nU.S. 649, 659\n, 56 S. L. ed. 934, 938, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 572, where a corporation was authorized to erect poles, etc., over the streets with the consent of the general council of the city, it was held that the charter franchises became 'fully operative' when the city's consent was obtained. 'Such a street franchise has been called by various names,-an incorporeal hereditament, an interest in land, an easement, a right of way,-but, howsoever designated, it is property.' Id. p. 661. Again, in the recent case of Owensboro v. Cumberland Teleph. & Teleg. Co. \n230 \nU.S. 58, 65\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1389, 1393, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 988, it was said: 'That an \n\n[235 U.S. 179, 193]\n\u00a0\n ordinance granting the right to place and maintain upon the streets of a city poles and wires of such a company is the granting of a property right has been too many times decided by this court to need more than a reference to some of the later cases.' See also Bois e Artesian Hot & Cold Water Co. v. Bois e City, \n230 \nU.S. 84, 91\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1400, 1406, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 997. These municipal consents are intended to afford the basis of enterprise with reciprocal advantages, and it would be virtually impossible to fulfil the manifest intent of the legislature and to secure the benefits expected to flow from the privileges conferred, if, in the initial states of the enterprise, when the necessary proceedings preliminary to the execution of the proposed work are being taken with due promptness, or when the work is under way, the municipal consent should be subject to revocation at any time by the authorities,-not upon the ground that the contract had not been performed, or that any condition thereof, express or implied, had been broken, but because as yet no contract whatever had been made, and there was nothing but a license, which might be withdrawn at pleasure. Grants like the one under consideration are not nude pacts, but rest upon obligations expressly or impliedly assumed to carry on the undertaking to which they relate. See The Binghamton Bridge ( Chenango Bridge Co. v. Binghamton Bridge Co.) 3 Wall. 51, 74, 18 L. ed. 137, 142; Pearsall v. Great Northern R. Co. \n161 \nU.S. 646, 663\n, 667 S., 40 L. ed. 838, 844, 845, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 705. They are made and received with the understanding that the recipient is protected by a contractual right from the moment the grant is accepted and during the course of performance as contemplated, as well as after that performance. The case of Capital City Light & Fuel Co. v. Tallahassee, \n186 U.S. 401\n, 46 L. ed. 1219, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 866, to which the defendant in error refers, is not opposed. There the complainant, upon the ground of an exclusive privilege, sought to enjoin a municipality from operating its own electric light plant; although ten years had elapsed since the complainant's grant, the complainant had done nothing whatever to establish an electric light business, and under the \n\n[235 U.S. 179, 194]\n\u00a0\n express terms of the statute the exclusive privilege had not attached (id. p. 410).\n But, while the grant becomes effective when made and accepted in accordance with the statute, and the grantee is thus protected in starting the enterprise, it has always been recognized that, as the franchise is given in order that it may be exercised for the public benefit, the failure to exercise it as contemplated is ground for revocation or withdrawal. In the cases where the right of revocation in the absence of express condition has been denied, it will be found that there has been performance at least to some substantial extent, or that the grantee is duly proceeding to perform. And when it is said that there is vested an indefeasible interest, easement, or contract right, it is plainly meant to refer to a franchise not only granted, but exercised in conformity with the grant. (See cases cited supra.) It is a tacit condition annexed to grants of franchises that they may be lost by misuser or nonuser. Terrett v. Taylor, 9 Cranch, 43, 51, 3 L. ed. 650, 653; Chicago L. Ins. Co. v. Needles, \n113 \nU.S. 574, 580\n, 28 S. L. ed. 1084, 1087, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 681; Given v. Wright, \n117 \nU.S. 648, 656\n, 29 S. L. ed. 1021, 1024, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 907. The condition thus implied is, of course, a condition subsequent. The same principle is applicable when a municipality under legislative authority gives the permission which brings the franchise into being; there is necessarily implied the condition of user. The concoption of the permission as giving rise to a right of property in no way involves the notion that the exercise of the franchise may be held in abeyance for an indefinite time, and that the right may thus be treated as a permanent lien upon the public streets, to be enforced for the advantage of the owner at any time, however distant. Although the franchise is property, 'it is subject to defeasance or forfeiture by failure to exercise it ( People v. Broadway R. Co. 126 N. Y. 29, 26 N. E. 961), or by subsequent abandonment after it has been exercised (People v. Albany & V. R. Co. 24 N. Y. 261, 82 Am. Dec. 295).' If 'no time is prescribed, the \n\n[235 U.S. 179, 195]\n\u00a0\n franchise must be exercised within a reasonable time.' New York v. Bryan, 196 N. Y. 158, 164, 89 N. E. 467.\n It follows that where the franchise has not been exercised within a reasonable time in accordance with the condition which inheres in the nature of the grant, its revocation upon this ground cannot be regarded as an impairment of contractual obligation. The privileges conferred may be withdrawn by such methods of procedure as are consistent with established legal principles. This rule, frequently recognized in cases where franchises have been abused or misemployed (see Chicago L. Ins. Co. v. Needles, \n113 \nU.S. 574, 580\n, 28 S. L. ed. 1084, 1087, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 681; Farmers' Loan & T. Co. v. Galesburg, \n133 \nU.S. 156, 179\n, 33 S. L. ed. 573, 582, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 316; New Orleans Waterworks Co. v. Louisiana, \n185 \nU.S. 336, 347\n, 46 S. L. ed. 936, 942, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 691; Columbus v. Mercantile Trust & D. Co. \n218 \nU.S. 645, 663\n, 54 S. L. ed. 1193, 1199, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 105; Dill. Mun. Corp. 5th ed.  1311), must also be applicable where they have been neglected, that is, have not been used in due time. Whether in such cases, where there has been a municipal permission for use of streets, the state shall proceed directly by quo warranto, or whether it shall authorize the municipality to pass a resolution or ordinance of repeal or revocation, leaving the propriety of its course to be determined in an appropriate legal proceeding in which the default of the grantee may be adjudicated, is a question of state law with which we are not concerned. The resolution in such case serves to define the attitude of the public authorities, and to revoke the permission where sufficient ground exists for such revocation. Whether there has been such a misuse or nonexercise of the franchise as to warrant its withdrawal is a matter for judicial consideration.\n In the present case, the plaintiff in error, insisting upon its continuing right, despite the resolution of revocation, applied for a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel the Subway Company-a quasipublic instrumentality-to furnish the desired space in its conduits. It had been \n\n[235 U.S. 179, 196]\n\u00a0\n held by the state court that this was an available remedy where a company had 'lawful power' to operate its conductors in the city's streets, and had been denied the space which the Subway Company by its contract with the city had agreed to give. Re Long Acre Electric Light & P. Co. 188 N. Y. 361, 80 N. E. 1101. The question of 'lawful power' of the plaintiff in error was considered and the application refused. It is true that it was stated that there was a license only which, by reason of nonperformance, had not ripened into a contract right, but it is equally true that the nonperformance shown was available to defeat that right, assuming it to have been created at the time of the grant, and to make the resolution of revocation-which the state court has held was adopted under state authority-entirely proper.\n For a long period of years after the final determination of the validity of the statutes authorizing a comprehensive scheme of subway construction, and after the contract with the Subway Company had been made, the plaintiff in error made no attempt to secure space and to exercise the franchise now claimed. It treated that right as susceptible of practically indefinite retention unused. In the circumstances disclosed, its excuses are unavailing. The right conferred, assuming it to be a contract right, was to be used within a reasonable time or lost. In view of the state of the case as to nonexercise, it cannot be said that its constitutional right has been infringed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Milhau v. Sharp, 27 N.

Reed for defendant in error.\n\n\n[234 U.S. 149, 154]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n In March, 1894, Richard G. Head, a citizen and resident of New Mexico, being temporarily in Kansas City, Missouri, made application at a branch office of the New York Life Insurance Company for two policies of insurance for $10,000 each on his own life, for the benefit of his minor son, Richard G. Head, Jr. The application stated the residence of Head in New Mexico, and it was stipulated that the policy applied for when issued should \n\n[234 U.S. 149, 155]\n\u00a0\n be considered as having been issued in New York, and be treated as a New York contract. When Head made the application he handed a note for the premium to the agent with instructions, when the policies came, to turn them over to a friend to hold for him. The policies were issued, were delivered as directed, and were subsequently turned over to Head when he again came to Kansas City. All the premiums but the first, with perhaps one exception, were paid in New Mexico or at an agency of the company in Colorado. Nine years after the issue of the policies, that is, in 1903, in New Mexico, Head transferred one of the policies to his daughter, Mary E. Head, the transfer having been either by way of original authority or ratification duly sanctioned by the proper probate court in the county of New Mexico where Head was domiciled. In 1904, Mary E. Head, under the policy of which she thus became the beneficiary, borrowed from the New York Life Insurance Company the sum of $2,270. The loan was requested by a letter written from Las Vegas, New Mexico, to New York, and accompanied by the policy and an executed loan agreement in the form usually required by the company, and which conformed to the requirements of the New York law. The loan bore 5 per cent interest and the agreement provided that it should be payable at the home office in New York, and that if any premium on the policy or any interest on the loan were not paid when due, 'settlement of said loan and of any other indebtedness under said policy shall be made by continuing said policy without further notice as paid-up insurance of reduced amount in accordance with  88, chapter 690, of the Laws of 1892 of the state of New York.'\n There was default in April, 1905, in the payment of the interest on the loan and the premium on the policy, and pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement and the law of New York the policy was settled, the sum remaining from the accumulated surplus after paying the loan and \n\n[234 U.S. 149, 156]\n\u00a0\n the past-due premium being applied to the purchase of paid-up insurance, and the policy was, at the request of Head and his daughter, sent to them in New Mexico in May, 1905, and was in the possession of the daughter when Head died in April, 1906\n\n\n In September, 1906, this suit was commenced in a court of the state of Missouri, by Mary E. Head, the beneficiary, to recover the full amount of the policy. Stating the grounds for relief which were relied upon not as literally expressed in the pleadings, but with reference to the ultimate assumption upon which the right to recover was essentially based, it was as follows: That although it was true that if the face of the policy was adhered to and the terms of the loan agreement were considered and the law of New York applied, the settlement of the policy would be binding, it was not so binding, but, on the contrary, was void, because at the time the policy was written there were statutes in force in the state of Missouri which made it the duty of the company to retain from the accumulated suplus a given percentage thereof, and in case it was necessary to save forfeiture, to apply the sum of such retained percentage to the payment of premium on temporary insurance as far as it would go, and if this duty had been discharged when the failure to pay took place, the sum of the retained percentage would have been adequate to extend the insurance to such a period as would have caused the full amount of the policy to be a valid and existing risk at the death of Head. Resting thus upon the Missouri statutes, of course the fundamental assumption upon which the right to recover was based was the controlling operation and effect of the Missouri law upon the policy, upon the terms of the loan agreement, and upon the law of the state of New York which would otherwise govern, as New York was the place where the loan agreement was made and the adjustment of the policy took place. As there is no controversy concerning the meaning of the \n\n[234 U.S. 149, 157]\n\u00a0\n Missouri statutes if they were controlling, we content ourselves with referring to the sections of the Revised Statutes of Missouri which are relied upon as having produced the consequences stated: Sections 5856-5859 and 7897-7900 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri of 1899. And the defense, considered also in its ultimate aspect, but asserted the validity of the settlement made in New York under the loan agreement, denied the applicability of the statutes of Missouri to that settlement, and expressly insisted that such statutes could not be applied to the situation without violating the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, and depriving of the right of freedom of contract guaranteed by that Amendment, and giving rise to the impairment of the obligation of a contract, contrary to the provisions of  10, article 1 of the Constitution of the United States.\n There was recovery in the court of first instance for the amount claimed under the policy, the court maintaining the supremacy of the Missouri statutes. In the supreme court to which the case was taken after a hearing in a division thereof the judgment below was affirmed on an opinion which expressly held that the policy of insurance was a Missouri contract, controlled by the Missouri law, and that, by the operation and effect of that law, the loan agreement made in the state of New York, and the settlement effected in that state in accordance with that agreement, conformably to the laws of New York, was controlled by the Missouri statute and was void. And the opinion so holding was in express terms adopted by the court in banc where the case was reheard.\n The rights under the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States and the 14th Amendment, which, as we have stated, were asserted below, form the basis of the assignments of error. As the conflicting contentions concerning these constitutional questions advanced to refute, on the one hand, and to sustain, on the \n\n[234 U.S. 149, 158]\n\u00a0\n other, the reasons which led the court below to its conclusion, involve the whole case, to briefly state at the outset the propositions upheld below will concentrate the issues and serve to give bold relief to the questions which require to be decided. (a) Determining whether the contract was a Missouri contract, made in that state and governed by its laws, the court held that the express stipulation in the contract to the effect that the policy was to be considered as issued from the home office, and be treated as a New York contract, was overborne by the fact that the application for the policy was made to the Kansas City agency, that the policy was sent there for delivery, and that the first premium was there paid. (b) In deciding that this view was not modified by the fact that the insured was a nonresident of Missouri, and by the further fact that, on the face of the policy, it was clearly manifest that it was executed not for the purpose of having effect in Missouri, but to be operative outside of that state, the court said:\n'It has been repeatedly ruled in this state since the enactment of  5856 et seq. of the Revision of 1889 (now Rev. Stat. 1909,  6946) and the act of 1891 (Laws 1891, p. 75), Rev. Stat. 1899,  1024 and 1026 (now Rev. Stat. 1909,  3037, 3040), that foreign insurance companies admitted to carry on their business in this state can only contract within the limits prescribed by our statutes, and that, in the conduct of the business under the license granted by this state, they 'shall be subjected to all the liabilities, restrictions, and duties which are or may be imposed upon corporations of like character organized under the general laws of this state, and shall have no other or greater powers.' The effect of these decisions is to write into every insurance contract made by a foreign insurance company, so licensed, in this state, all of the provisions of the statutes of this state appurtenant to the making of such contract, and which define and measure the reciprocal rights and duties of the parties thereto. \n\n[234 U.S. 149, 159]\n\u00a0\n These statutes are declaratory of the public policy of this state, and inhibit the doing of the business of insurance in this state by any corporation contrary to their regulations by annulling all the stipulations which offend the provisions of the statutes.

New York L. Ins. Co. 148 Mo. 583, 53 L.R.A. 305, 71 Am. St. Rep. 628, 50 S. W. 519; New York L. Ins. Co. v. Cravens, \n178 U.S. 389\n, 44 L. ed. 1116, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 962; Whitfield v. AEtna L. Ins. Co. \n205 U.S. 489\n, 51 L. ed. 895, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 578, affirming Keller v. Travelers' Ins. Co. 58 Mo. App. 557.' [241 Mo. 413, 147 S. W. 827.]\n\n\n (c)\n In disposing of the contention that, as the loan agreement was made in New York by persons not citizens of Missouri, and was sanctioned by the law of New York, it could not be treated as void by extending the Missouri statutes into the state of New York without a violation of the 14th Amendment, and without impairing the obligation of a contract, the court said:\n'It is not an open question in this state, that all subsidiary contracts made by the parties to an insurance contract are within the contemplation and purview of the original contract, and are not to be treated as independent agreements. This being so, they are inefficacious to alter, change, or modify the rights and obligations as they existed under the original contract of insurance. Burridge v. New York L. Ins. Co. 211 Mo. 158, 109 S. W. 560; Smith v. Mutual Ben. L. Ins. Co. 173 Mo. 329, 72 S. W. 935.'\n\n Before approaching the constitutional questions relied upon in the light of these rulings we must dispose of a motion to dismiss. It rests upon the ground that, as the court below sustained its ruling by reference to a line of state decisions, a leading one of which had been affirmed by this court (New York L. Ins. Co. v. Cravens, \n178 U.S. 389\n, 44 L. ed. 1116, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 962) prior to the decision below, therefore, as the basis for jurisdiction had been demonstrated to be unfounded by a decision of this court announced prior to the time the writ of error was prosecuted, there was no substantial ground upon which to base the suing out of the writ, and it \n\n[234 U.S. 149, 160]\n\u00a0\n must be dismissed. But the contention rests upon a plain misconception as to what was involved and decided in the Cravens Case, since that case but concerned a contract of insurance made in Missouri as to a citizen of that state, and required it only to be determined whether rights under the Constitution of the United States had been denied by the ruling of the state court holding void a forfeiture of a policy which had been declared by the corporation for a failure to pay in Missouri a premium there due when such forfeiture was in direct violation of the prohibition of the state law. The difference, therefore, between that case and this, is that which, in the nature of things, must obtain between questions concerning the operation and effect of a state law within its borders and upon the conduct of persons confessedly within its jurisdiction, and its right to extend its authority beyond its borders so as to control contracts made between citizens of other states, and virtually, in fact, to disregard the law of such other states by which the acts done were admittedly valid.\n Coming to the merits, to narrow the subject to be decided as much as possible, we pass the consideration of the ruling below, holding that, under the proof, the contract was a Missouri contract, and therefore, for the sake of argument only, concede that there was power in the state to treat the contract made for the purposes stated as a Missouri contract, and to subject it, as to matters and things which were legitimately within the state authority, to the rule of the state law. And this concession brings us to consider the second general inquiry, which is the power of the state of Missouri to extend the operation of its statutes beyond its borders into the jurisdiction of other states, so as in such other states to destroy or impair the right of persons not citizens of Missouri to contract, although the contract could in no sense be operative in Missouri, and although the contract was sanctioned by the law of the state where made. That is to say, the right of a state where a contract \n\n[234 U.S. 149, 161]\n\u00a0\n concerning a particular subject-matter not in its essence intrinsically and inherently local is once made within its borders not merely to legislate concerning acts done or agreements made within the state in the future, concerning such original contract, but to affect the parties to such original contract with a perpetual contractual paralysis following them outside of the jurisdiction of the state or original contract by prohibiting them from doing any act or making any agreement concerning the original contract not in accord with the law of the state where the contract was originally made. In other words, concretely speaking, we must consider the validity of the loan agreement; that is, how far it was within the power of the state of Missouri to extend its authority into the state of New York, and there forbid the parties, one of whom was a citizen of New Mexico and the other a citizen of New York, from making such loan agreement in New York simply because it modified a contract originally made in Missouri. Such question, we think, admits of but one answer, since it would be impossible to permit the statutes of Missouri to operate beyond the jurisdiction of that state and in the state of New York, and there destroy freedom of contract without throwing down the constitutional barriers by which all the states are restricted within the orbits of their lawful authority, and upon the preservation of which the government under the Constitution depends. This is so obviously the necessary result of the Constitution that it has rarely been called in question, and hence authorities directly dealing with it do not abound. The principle, however, lies at the foundation of the full faith and credit clause and the many rulings which have given effect to that clause. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[234 U.S. 149, 162]\n\u00a0\n It is illustrated as regards the right to freedom of contract by the ruling in Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 U.S. 578\n, 41 L. ed. 832, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 427, and it finds expression in the decisions of this court affirmatively establishing that a state may not, consistently with due process clause of the 14th Amendment, extend its authority beyond its legitimate jurisdiction either by way of the wrongful exertion of judicial power or the unwarranted exercise of the taxing power. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n And an analysis of the opinion of the court below makes it clear that its ruling was rested not upon any doubt concerning the obvious operation of the Constitution which we have pointed out, but because it was deemed that the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case took it out of the general rule and caused it to be therefore a law unto itself. We say this because, while it is true the court based its conclusion upon a line of cases previously decided in that state, as all the cases thus relied upon involved only policies of insurance issued in Missouri to citizens of Missouri, and were solely concerned with the effect of acts done in Missouri which it was asserted were forbidden by the statutes of that state existing at the time when the acts were done, it could not have been that the cases were deemed to be controlling upon the principle of stare decisis, but they must have been held to be controlling because of the persuasive force of the reasoning upon which they had been decided. Indeed, this is not left to inference, since the court below in its opinion summarized the reasoning in the previous cases as shown by the passage which we have quoted, and made it the groundwork of its ruling in this case, that reasoning being as follows: Insurance companies chartered by Missouri took their existence from \n\n[234 U.S. 149, 163]\n\u00a0\n the grant of the state, and therefore had no power to contract in excess of that which was conferred upon them by the state; hence, all acts done by them which were prohibited by the state law were ultra vires and void. But, as foreign insurance companies have no right to come into the state and there do business except as the result of a license from the state, and as the state exacts as a condition of a license that all foreign insurance companies shall be subject to the laws of the state as if they were domestic corporations, it follows that the limitations of the state law resting upon domestic corporations also rest upon foreign companies, and therefore deprive them of any power which a domestic company could not enjoy, thus rendering void or inoperative any provision of their charter or condition in policies issued by them or contracts made by them inconsistent with the Missouri law. But when this reasoning is analyzed, we think it affords no ground whatever for taking this case out of the general rule and making the distinction relied upon. This is so as the proposition cannot be maintained without holding that because a state has power to license a foreign insurance company to do business within its borders, and the authority to regulate such business, therefore a state has power to regulate the business of such company outside its borders, and which would otherwise be beyond the state's authority. A distinction which brings the contention right back to the primordial conception upon which alone it would be possible to sanction the doctrine contended for, that is, that because a state has power to regulate its domestic concerns, therefore it has the right to control the domestic concerns of other states. It is apparent, therefore, that to accept the doctrine it would have to be said that the distribution of powers and the limitations which arise from the existence of the Constitution are ephemeral, and depend simply upon the willingness of any of the states to exact as a condition of a license granted to a foreign cor- \n\n[234 U.S. 149, 164]\n\u00a0\n poration to do business within its borders that the Constitution shall be inapplicable and its limitations worth nothing. It would go further than this, since it would require it to be decided not only that the constitutional limitations on state powers could be set aside as the result of a license, but that the granting of such license could be made the means of extending state power so as to cause it to embrace subjects wholly beyond its legitimate authority.\n It is true it has been held that, in view of the power of a state over insurance, it might, as the condition of a license given to a foreign insurance company to do business within its borders, impose a condition as to business within the state, which otherwise, but for the complete power to exclude, would be held repugnant to the Constitution. In other words, that a company having otherwise no right whatever, for any purpose, to go in without a license, would not be heard, after accepting the same, to complain of exactions upon which the license was conditioned as unconstitutional, because of its voluntary submission to the same. But even if it be put out of view that his doctrine has been either expressly or by necessary implication overruled, or, at all events, so restricted as to deprive it of all application to this case (see Harrison v. St. Louis & S. F. R. Co. \n232 \nU.S. 318, 332\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 333, and authorities there cited), it here can have no possible application since such doctrine, at best, but recognized the power of a state, under the circumstances stated, to impose conditions upon the right to do the business embraced by the license, and therefore gives no support to the contention here presented, which is that a state, by a license, may acquire the right to exert an authority beyond its borders which it cannot exercise consistently with the Constitution. But the Constitution and its limitations are the safeguards of all the states, preventing any and all of them, under the guise of license or otherwise, from exercising powers not possessed. \n\n[234 U.S. 149, 165]\n\u00a0\n As it follows from what we have said that the primary conception upon which the court below assumed this case might be taken out of the general rule, and thereby the state of Missouri be endowed with authority which could not be exercised consistently with the Constitution, was erroneous, it results that the necessity for reversal is demonstrated without requiring us to consider other propositions. But before we come to direct the judgment of reversal, we briefly refer to another aspect of the subject, that is, the ruling of the court below as to the subsidiary nature of the loan agreement, and its consequent control by the broader principle upon which its conclusion was really based. Of course, under the view which we have taken of the case, that is, of the want of power of the state of Missouri, because the contract of insurance was made within its jurisdiction, to forever thereafter control by its laws all subsequent agreements made in other jurisdictions by persons not citizens of Missouri, and lawful where made,-that is, to stereotype, as it were, the will of the parties contracting in Missouri as of the date of the contract,-it is unnecessary to consider whether the loan agreement was or was not subsidiary; but see on this subject, Leonard v. Charter Oak L. Ins. Co. 65 Conn. 529, 33 Atl. 511; Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Dunn, 22 Ind. App. 332, 53 N. E. 251; S. S. White Dental Mfg. Co. v. Delaware Ins. Co. 105 Fed. 642; 2 Wharton, Confl.

CO. v. ZACHARY(1914)\nNo. 144\nArgued: Decided: February 2, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 248, 249]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John K. Graves for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 248, 252]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas H. Calvert, John A. Barringer, and George S. Bradshaw for defendant in error.\n\n\n[232 U.S. 248, 254]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was brought in the superior court of Guilford county, North Carolina, to recover damages for the negligent killing of Burgess a locomotive fireman in the employ of the Southern Railway Company, lessee of the defendant, which occurred at Selma, North Carolina, on April 29, 1909, Under the local law, as laid down in Logan v. North Carolina R. Co. 116 N. C. 940, 21 S. E. 959, the lessor is responsible for all acts of negligence of its lessee occurring in the conduct of business upon the lessor's road; and this upon the ground that a railroad corporation cannot evade its public duty and responsibility by leasing its road to another corporation, in the absence of a statute expressly exempting it. The responsibility is held to extend to employees of the lessee, injured through the negligence of the latter.\n The complaint set forth in substance that plaintiff's intestate, being in the employ of defendant's lessee, and engaged at the Selma switchyards in the discharge of his duties as fireman upon engine No. 862, about 8 o'clock, P. M., on the date mentioned, after inspecting, ciling, firing, and preparing the engine for starting on a trip from Selma to Spencer, North Carolina, attempted to cross certain tracks that intervened between the engine and his \n\n[232 U.S. 248, 255]\n\u00a0\n boarding house, which was located a short distance away; that another engine, No. 716, was standing upon a side track in such position as to shut off intestate's view of the main track; that No. 716 had its blower on, and was making a noise so loud that intestate could not hear a third engine,-No. 1551, the shifting engine used in the yards,-which at this time was running backward at a reckless and dangerous rate of speed, without headlight and without an adequate and competent crew; and that as intestate stepped from the track in the rear of engine No. 716, and was about to step upon the main line in the attempt to cross it, he was struck and killed by the shifting engine. Defendant's answer, besides denying the allegations of negligence, set up as a special defense that at the time plaintiff's intestate was killed, he was engaged in interstate commerce as an employee upon a train of defendant's lessee which was moving from Selma, North Carolina, to Spencer, in the same state, and carrying cars loaded with freight from the state of Virginia to the state of North Carolina and other states; that the liability of the defendant to him or to the plaintiff as his representative was fixed and regulated by the Federal employers' liability act of April 22, 1908 [35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1322], and that under that act the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.\n Upon the trial, at the close of plaintiff's evidence, which tended generally to support the averments of the complaint, defendant moved for a nonsuit, and among other grounds assigned the following:-that from the uncontradicted evidence it appeared that at the time of the occurrence in question defendant, through its lessee, was a common carrier by railroad, engaged in interstate commerce, and plaintiff's intestate was at that time a person employed by such carrier in such commerce; that the act of Congress already referred to exclusively regulated the liability of defendant to plaintiff's intestate, and that upon all the evidence plaintiff had failed to make out a \n\n[232 U.S. 248, 256]\n\u00a0\n case of liability under that act. The court, in denying the motion, held that the action was brought under the statute of North Carolina, that the Federal act had no application, and that the cause was triable under the statutes of the state. To this ruling, defendant excepted. At the close of the case, defendant again undertook to invoke the protection of the Federal act by requested instructions to the jury, which were refused and exceptions allowed.\n There was a verdict for plaintiff and judgment thereon, followed by an appeal to the supreme court of the state. That court overruled the contention of defendant that the Federal employers' liability act of April 22, 1908, applied, and held that the action was properly tried under the state law. The result was an affirmance (156 N. C. 496, 72 S. E. 858), and the case comes here under  709, Rev. Stat. U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575 ( Judicial Code,  237 [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 227]).\n In order to bring the case within the terms of the Federal act (35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1322, printed in full in 223 U. S. p. 6, 56 L. ed. 329, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 44, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 169, 1 N. C. C. A.875), defendant must have been, at the time of the occurrence in question, engaged as a common carrier in interstate commerce, and plaintiff's intestate must have been employed by said carrier in such commerce. If these facts appeared, the Federal act governed, to the exclusion of the statutes of the state. Second Employers' Liability Cases ( Mondou v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co.) \n223 \nU.S. 1, 55\n, 56 S. L. ed. 327, 348, 38 L.R.A. (N.S.) 44, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 169, 1 N. C. C. A. 875; St. Louis, S. F. & T. R. Co. v. Seale, \n229 \nU.S. 156, 158\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1129, 1133, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 651.\n It is not disputed that if the provisions of the Federal act had been applied, the result of the action might have been different. To mention only one matter: there was neither averment in the pleadings nor evidence at the trial that deceased left a widow, child, parent, or dependent next of kin. Persons thus related to deceased are the respective beneficiaries of the action prescribed by the act of Congress, and the damages are to be based upon the \n\n[232 U.S. 248, 257]\n\u00a0\n pecuniary loss sustained by the beneficiary. Michigan C. R. Co. v. Vreeland, \n227 \nU.S. 59, 68\n, 57 S. L. ed. 417, 420, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 192; Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. McGinnis, \n228 U.S. 173\n, 57 L. ed. 785, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 426. The state law (Revisal 1908,  2646) seems not to recognize this limitation upon the measure of recovery; certainly the damages in the present case were assessed without regard to it.\n In support of the judgment, it is earnestly argued that the question whether deceased was employed in interstate commerce was not properly raised in the trial court, in accordance with the pertinent provisions of the local Code of Civil Procedure. But this is a question of state practice; and since it appears that defendant expressly claimed immunity by reason of the act of Congress, and the highest court of the state either decided or assumed that the record sufficiently presented a question of Federal right, and decided against the party asserting that right, the decisions of this court render it clear that it is our duty to pass upon the merits of the Federal question.

Rep. 309\n The court based its decision that the Federal act did not apply, in part upon the ground that the North Carolina Railroad is not an interstate railroad,-its tracks and property lying wholly within the state,-and that the corporation itself is not, although its lessee is, engaged in interstate commerce; the lessor's activities being confined to receiving annual rents and distributing them among its stockholders. The responsibility of the lessor for all acts of negligence of the lessee occurring in the conduct of business on the lessor's road, as established by the same court in Logan v. North Carolina R. Co. 116 N. C. 941, 21 S. E. 959, was recognized-indeed, reasserted. 'But,' it was said, 'that is because a railroad corporation cannot escape its respon- \n\n[232 U.S. 248, 258]\n\u00a0\n sibility by leasing its road. It is still liable for its lessee's acts of commission and omission, whether they occur in interstate or intrastate commerce, although the lessor is not actually engaged in either.' [156 N. C. 500, 72 S. E. 858.]\n It is plain enough, however, that the effect of the rule thus laid down, especially in view of the grounds upon which it is based, is, that although a railroad lease as between the parties may have the force and effect of an ordinary lease, yet with respect to the railroad operations conducted under it, and everything that relates to the performance of the public duties assumed by the lessor under its charter, such a lease- certainly so far as concerns the rights of third parties, including employees as well as patrons-constitutes the lessee the lessor's substitute or agent, so that for whatever the lessee does or fails to do, whether in interstate or in intrastate commerce, the lessor is responsible. This being the legal situation under the local law, it seems to us that it must and does result, in the the case before us, that the lessor is a 'common carrier by railroad, engaging in commerce between the states,' and that the deceased was 'employed by such carrier in such commerce,' within the meaning of the Federal act; provided, of course, he was employed by the lessee in such commerce at the time he was killed.\n It was, however, further held by the supreme court of North Carolina that deceased, at the time he was killed, was not in fact employed by the Southern Railway, the lessee, in interstate commerce. There are several grounds upon which this decision was based, or upon which it is said to be supportable; and these will be separately noticed. Of course, if, upon the evidence, any essential matter of fact was in doubt, it should have been submitted to the jury under proper instructions. The rulings of the trial court deprived plaintiff in error of the opportunity to go to the jury upon the question. But it is now insisted that there was no evidence tending to show that \n\n[232 U.S. 248, 259]\n\u00a0\n deceased was engaged in interstate commerce. This renders it incumbent upon us to analyze the evidence to the extent necessary to give to plaintiff in error the benefit of its asserted Federal right. Southern P. Co. v. Schuyler, \n227 \nU.S. 601, 611\n, 57 S. L. ed. 662, 669, 43 L.R.A.(N.S.) 901, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 277, and cases cited.\n The evidence tended to show that train No. 72 of the Southern Railway had come into Selma, North Carolina, from Pinners Point, Virginia and other places, and that a shifting crew was 'working' this train so as to take two cars from it and put them into a train that was to include these and other cars to be hauled from Selma to Spencer, North Carolina by engine No. 862, and that deceased was employed on this engine as fireman for the trip that was about to begin, and had already prepared his engine for the purpose. It is contended that the evidence failed to show that the two cars thus taken from train No. 72 had come in from Virginia, rather than from the 'other places,' which it is said might be intermediate North Carolina points. We find, however, evidence that the train which was to be hauled from Selma to Spencer by engine No. 862 was being made up in part from cars that had come in from Pinners Point; and it was at least a reasonable inference that the two cars referred to were being put into the Spencer train in order to be carried forward as a part of a through movement of interstate commerce.\n There seems to be no clear evidence as to the contents of these cars, and it is argued that, in the absence of evidence, it is as reasonable to infer that they were empty as that they were loaded; and that it was incumbent upon defendant to show that they contained interstate freight. We hardly deem it so probable that empty freight cars would be hauled from the Virginia point to Spencer. But were it so, the hauling of empty cars from one state to another is, in our opinion, interstate commerce within the meaning of the act. Such is the view that has obtained with respect to empty cars in actions based upon the \n\n[232 U.S. 248, 260]\n\u00a0\n safety appliance act of March 2, 1893 (27 Stat. at L. 531, chap. 196, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3174). Johnson v. Southern P. Co. \n196 \nU.S. 1, 21\n, 49 S. L. ed. 363, 371, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 158, 17 Am. Neg. Rep. 412; Voelker v. Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. 116 Fed. 867, 873. And the like reason applies, as we think, to actions founded upon the employers' liability act, which, indeed, is in pari materia with the other\n It is argued that because, so far as appears, deceased had not previously participated in any movement of interstate freight, and the through cars had not as yet been attached to his engine, his employment in interstate commerce was still in futuro. It seems to us, however, that his acts in inspecting, oiling, firing, and preparing his engine for the trip to Selma were acts performed as a part of interstate commerce and the circumstance that the interstate freight cars had not as yet been coupled up is legally insignificant. See Pedersen v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. \n229 \nU.S. 146, 151\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1125, 1127, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 648; St. Louis, S. F. & T. R. Co. v. Seale, \n229 \nU.S. 156, 161\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1129, 1134, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 651.\n Again, it is said that because deceased had left his engine and was going to his boarding house, he was engaged upon a personal errand, and not upon the carrier's business. Assuming (what is not clear) that the evidence fairly tended to indicate the boarding house as his destination, it nevertheless also appears that deceased was shortly to depart upon his run, having just prepared his engine for the purpose, and that he had not gone beyond the limits of the railroad yard when he was struck. There is nothing to indicate that this brief visit to the boarding house was at all out of the ordinary, or was inconsistent with his duty to his employer. It seems to us clear that the man was still 'on duty,' and employed in commerce, notwithstanding his temporary absence from the locomotive engine. See Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 112, 119\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 26.\n We conclude that, with respect to the facts necessary to bring the case within the Federal act, there was evi- \n\n[232 U.S. 248, 261]\n\u00a0\n dence that at least was sufficient to go to the jury. It is doubtful whether there was substantial contradiction respecting any of these facts; but this we need not consider.\n From what has been said, it follows that the state courts erred in holding that the Federal act had no application. As the case stands, we are not called upon to determine the validity of the several contentions that were raised by defendant at the trial on the strength of that act, nor to pass upon the mode in which they were raised. Upon these matters, therefore, we express no opinion.\n Judgment reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","157":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nO'SULLIVAN v. FELIX(1914)\nNo. 249\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 318, 319]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. S. Parkerson and E. A. O'sullivan for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Charles S. Rice and R. B. Montgomery for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Action for damages for personal assault upon plaintiff in error, herein called plaintiff, by defendants in error, referred to as defendants, in the sum of $60,000.\n The petition alleges that defendants and others were indicted for violating  5508 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3712). The indictment is set out in the petition, and charges, with the usual verbosity of such instruments, \n\n[233 U.S. 318, 320]\n\u00a0\n that an election was held in the parish of Jefferson, state of Louisiana, on November 3, 1908, for presidential electors, members of Congress, and certain municipal officers, under and in accordance with the laws and Constitution of the United States; that certain named persons were, as defendants well knew, qualified to vote at such election, that such persons were at the polling places with the intention and for the purpose of voting, and, knowing this, the defendants feloniously conspired and confederated with each other and other persons to intimidate and prevent, and did prevent, by the use of deadly weapons, such persons from voting.\n It is alleged that the indictment further charged in a second count, a violation of  5509 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3712), in that the defendants, with other named persons, conspiring to intimidate the voters named in the first count from voting at the election named, 'did then and there, with force and arms, armed with dangerous weapons, to wit: pistols, guns, scissors, wilfully, maliciously, unlawfully, and feloniously and upon' the defendant commit an assault, and with the purpose and in the disposition described, 'with a dangerous weapon, to wit: a pair of scissors, inflict a wound less than mayhem.'\n That the defendants herein were convicted on both counts and sentenced to fine and imprisonment, and upon appeal to the circuit court of appeals the conviction, sentemcs, and fine were affirmed.\n That the defendants conspired to prevent and did prevent the voters named in the indictment from voting, and that in furtherance of the conspiracy plaintiff was maliciously and without cause or provocation 'cut, bruised, beaten, his face and eye blackened, his beard cut, he knocked down senseless, and other indignities were heaped upon him' by the defendants, for which he has suffered damages in the sum of $60,000.\n The plaintiff is sixty-five years of age, has practised \n\n[233 U.S. 318, 321]\n\u00a0\n law and held positions of honor and trust in the state, having been district attorney, state senator, and city attorney for the city of New Orleans.\n The petition recites the injuries plaintiff received in defending himself from the assault upon him, and that he 'was forced to appear in public, in performing his duties, carrying on his person the signs of the degradation and humiliation placed upon him.'\n The items of damages are set out as follows: For the wounding less than mayhem, $25,000; for humiliation, degradation, and public ridicule and pain of mind, $25,000; punitive and exemplary damages, $10,000. Judgment was prayed for $60,000, the sum of these items.\n Exception was filed to the petition on the ground that the damages having, as it is alleged, been inflicted November 3, 1908, more than two years and five months before the filing of the petition, the action is barred 'by the prescription of one year from and after the day on which such damages were sustained, under the provisions of Articles 3536 and 3537 of the Civil Code of the state of Louisiana. Dismissal of the suit was prayed. The plea of prescription was sustained and the sole question pressed by counsel, and which we are called upon to decide, is the application of the state statute to the conceded cause of action. The court, in passing upon the application of the statute of limitations, said that plaintiff conceded that if the action was to be governed by the state statute it was prescribed, but he contended that it was an action for a penalty, and governed by the prescription of five years, established by  1047 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 727). The court was of opinion that the action was for 'remedial damages, and not for a penalty,' and maintained the plea of prescription, citing Campbell v. Haverhill, \n155 U.S. 610\n, 39 L. ed. 280, 15 Sup. Ct. Rcp. 217; Brady v. Daly, \n175 U.S. 148\n, 44 L. ed. 109, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 62, and dismissed the action with costs.\n Judgment of the circuit court was affirmed by the \n\n[233 U.S. 318, 322]\n\u00a0\n circuit court of appeals. The court decided that the action was one for damages, and not for a penalty, and the limitations of five years against penalties or forfeitures ( 1047, Rev. Stat.) was not applicable. It followed, the court said, that the state statute, which prescribes the action in one year, must be applied, citing  3536 and 3537 of the Civil Code of Louisiana. 114 C. C. A. 166, 194 Fed. 88.\n The opinions of the lower courts exhibit the contentions in the case, and the short question presented is whether the action is for damages or for a penalty. If for a penalty,  1047 of the Revised Statutes applies, which provides: 'No suit or prosecution for any penalty or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise, accruing under the laws of the United States, shall be maintained . . . unless the same is commenced within five years from the time when the penalty or forfeiture accrued.' If for damages, the provisions of the Louisiana Code are applicable. They are as follows: Article 3536. 'The following actions are prescribed in one year:\n'Those for injurious words, whether verbal or written, and those for damages caused by animals, or resulting from offenses or quasi offenses.'\n\n And the prescription runs from the day the damage is sustained. Section 3537\n\n\n That the action depends upon or arises under the laws of the United States does not preclude the application of the statute of limitations of the state is established beyond controversy by cases cited by the circuit court and by McClaine v. Rankin, \n197 U.S. 158\n, 49 L. ed. 702, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410, 3 Ann. Cas. 500.\n It is therefore not necessary to pursue in detail the argument of plaintiff based on the postulate that 'the Sovereign alone can limit the right of action,' and that because injury was inflicted on him in the course of violating Federal laws the limitation of the state could not apply. Congress, of course, could have, by specific provision, prescribed a limitation, but no specific provision is ad- \n\n[233 U.S. 318, 323]\n\u00a0\n duced. The limitation of five years is asserted on the ground that the action is for a penalty, and that it is such is deduced from the provisions of title 24 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Com. Stat. 1901, p. 1259), securing equal civil rights to all citizens.\n These provisions secure to all citizens the same rights that white citizens enjoy, and make every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any state or territory, deprives another of the rights secured, liable 'to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.' Section 1979 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1262).\n It is also provided that if a conspiracy be entered into between two or more persons to deprive another of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws, and the persons conspiring to or cause to be done any act in furtherance of the object of the conspiracy whereby another is injured in his person or property, or deprived of having or exercising any right or privilege as a citizen of the United States, the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages, occasioned by such injury or deprivation, against any one or more of the comspirators, Section 1980 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1262).\n Anyone having knowledge of the wrongs conspired to be done, and who, having power to prevent or aid in preventing the commission of the same, neglects or refuses to do so, shall be liable to the party injured or his legal representatives in an action on the case. Any number of defendants may be joined in the action. If the death of any party be caused by such act or neglect, the legal representatives of the deceased shall have an action therefor and may recover not exceeding $5,000 for the benefit of the widow of the deceased, if there be one, and, if there be no widow, then for the benefit of the next of kin. But no action under the provisions of the section can be sus- \n\n[233 U.S. 318, 324]\n\u00a0\n tained which is not commenced within one year after the cause of action accrued. Section 1981 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1263).\n Conspirators to injure, oppress, threaten or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or enjoyment of his rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the same, shall be fined not more than $5,000 and imprisoned not more than ten years; and shall, moreover, be ineligible to office under the United States. Section 5508 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901 p. 3712).\n If, in violating any of the provisions of the two preceding sections, any felony or misdemeanor be committed, the offender shall be punished as provided in the statelaws.\n And every person who, under color of any law, etc., subjects or causes to be subjected any inhabitant of any state or territory to the deprivation of rights under the laws and Constitution of the United States shall be fined not more than $1,000, or be imprisoned not more than one year, or both. Section 5510 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3713).\n There are other criminal provisions not necessary to mention.\n It will be observed, therefore, that the sections of the Revised Statutes which we have quoted provide criminal proceedings and punishment for the public wrong, and actions in law or equity for the redress of any private injury, with a limitation in one instance of the amount of recovery and of the time for commencing the action to one year.\n The penal and remedial provisions are therefore distinct and cannot be confounded. The term 'penalty' involves the idea of punishment for the infraction of the law, and is commonly used as including any extraordinary liability to which the law subjects a wrongdoer in favor of the person wronged, not limited to the damages suffered. United States v. Chouteau, \n102 \nU.S. 603, 611\n, 26 S. L. ed. 246, 249; Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 \nU.S. 666, 667\n, 36 S. L. ed. 1127, 1128, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 224. There is no justification for the contention of plaintiff, therefore, that the \n\n[233 U.S. 318, 325]\n\u00a0\n remedy provided for a penalty and the limitation of time of bringing an action is five years under  1047 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 727). It is very clear that the public wrong is punished by the fines and punishment prescribed, that the private injuries inflicted are to be redressed by civil suit, and the amount of recovery is determined by the extent of the injury received and the elements constituting it. This plaintiff indicates in his pleading, praying damages in the sum of $25,000 'for the wounding less than mayhem,' $25,000 'for the humiliation, degradation, and public ridicule,' and $10,000 'as punitive and exemplary damages.'\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","158":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOCAMPO v. U S(1914)\nNo. 270\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 91, 92]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William R. Harr and Clement L. Bouv e for plaintiffs in error.\n Solicitor General Davis for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n On November 5, 1908, an information was filed in the court of first instance of the city of Manila, charging plaintiffs in error, with others, as editors, proprietors, owners, directors, writers, managers, administrators, printers, and publishers of the newspaper 'El Renacimiento,' with publishing in that city a libel against Dean C. Worcester, then a member of the Philippine Commission. The information was subscribed and sworn to by the acting prosecuting attorney, and appended to it, and likewise sworn to by him, was the following declara- \n\n[234 U.S. 91, 93]\n\u00a0\n tion: 'A preliminary investigation has been conducted under my direction, having examined the witnesses under oath, in accordance with the provisions of  39 of act 183 (Manila charter), as amended by  2 of act 612 of the Philippine Commission.' Both affidavits were made before the judge of the court of first instance, who thereupon issued warrants of arrest, pursuant to which the parties accused were on the same day brought before the court. The information was read to them, and the court allowed them until November 7th to answer. Their attorney, being present, asked that they be furnished with a copy of the information, which request was granted, and a copy was delivered to each of the accused. Thereafter, and on November 7th, before entering any demurrer or answer, they moved to vacate the order of arrest, upon the ground that it was made without any preliminary investigation held by the court, and without any tribunal, was probable cause to believe the defendants having first determined that the alleged crime had been committed, and that there was provable cause to believe the defendants guilty of it; the procedure adopted being, as was claimed, in violation of  12 and 13 of General Orders, No. 58, issued by the military governor April 23, 1910, and of paragraphs 1, 3, 11, and 18 of  5 of the Philippines bill, enacted by the Congress of the United States on July 1, 1902; and it was insisted that  2 of act No. 612 of the Philippine Commission, which took from accused persons in the city of Manila the right to a preliminary investigation, was contrary to the cited paragraphs of the Philippines bill, because it provided that accused persons in that city might be deprived of their liberty without due process of law, denied to the inhabitants of that city the equal protection of the law, deprived persons detained there to answer for a criminal offense of the 'proper judicial proceedings,' and violated the guaranty against arbitrary detention. \n\n[234 U.S. 91, 94]\n\u00a0\n This motion being overruled, defendants moved for an order requiring the prosecuting attorney to submit to the court and to them for examination the proceedings of the preliminary investigation alleged to have been conducted by him. This motion was likewise overruled.\n Defendants then asked the court to hold a preliminary investigation before calling upon them to either demur to or answer the complaint. This motion being denied, demurrers were filed, which were overruled, and the defendants were called upon to plead to the information. They stood mute, and a plea of not guilty was entered for each of them. Upon their request, separate trials were granted. Ocampo was found guilty, and sentenced to six months' imprisonment and to pay a fine of 2,000 pesos and one fifth of the costs of the action. Kalaw was also found guilty, and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment and to pay a fine of 3,000 pesos and one fifth of the costs. Upon their writ of error, the supreme court of the Philippine Islands affirmed the judgment as to Ocampo, and modified the sentence imposed upon Kalaw so as to increase the period of his imprisonment to twelve months. 18 Philippine, 1. The present writ of error was then sued out.\n The insistence is here renewed, that the arrest and trial of plaintiffs in error were without a preliminary finding of probable cause, and therefore in violation of rights secured to them by the Philippine Bill of Rights (act of July 1, 1902,  5, chap. 1369, 32 Stat. at L. 692). This act, following the provisions of certain of the Amendments of the Constitution of the United States, declares, inter alia:\n'See 5. That no law shall be enacted in said islands which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law or deny to any person therein the equal protection of the laws.\n\n ... * * \n\n[234 U.S. 91, 95]\n\u00a0\n 'That no person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law; . . .\n ... * *\n'That no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation. . . .'\n\n Prior to its enactment, and under date April 23, 1900, General Orders, No. 58, had been promulgated by the military governor, amending the Criminal Code of Procedure in certain respects, and providing by  12 and 13 that every person making complaint charging the commission of a crime must inform the magistrate of all persons believed to have any knowledge of its commission, whereupon the magistrate must issue subpoenas requiring them to attend as witnesses, and must examine the informant or prosecutor and the witnesses, and take their depositions in writing, and, if satisfied from the investigation that the crime complained of had been committed, and that there was reasonable ground to believe that the party charged had committed it, the magistrate must issue an order of arrest.\n By  40 of act No. 183 of the Philippine Commission (the Manila charter, enacted August 1, 1901), municipal courts with criminal jurisdiction were established, and were empowered to conduct preliminary examinations, and to release, or commit and bind over, any person charged with an offense, to secure his appearance before the proper court; it being, among other things, provided that 'every person arrested shall, without unnecessary delay, be brought before a municipal court or a court of first instance for preliminary hearing, release on bail, or trial.'\n Section 44 provided for two justices of the peace for the city of Manila, to exercise within the city the civil jurisdiction conferred upon justices of the peace in act No. 136; but they were debarred from exercising any criminal jurisdiction, such jurisdiction within the city being confined to courts of first instance and the municipal courts. \n\n[234 U.S. 91, 96]\n\u00a0\n By act No. 186 (August 5, 1901), the existing courts of justices of the peace in the city of Manila were abolished, and civil actions and proceedings then pending therein were transferred to the courts of justices of the peace established under act No. 183, while pending criminal actions and proceedings were transferred to the municipal courts established under act No. 183.\n Act No. 194 (August 10, 1901), in its 1st section provides: 'Every justice of the peace in the Philippine Islands is hereby invested with authority to make preliminary investigation of any crime alleged to have been committed within his municipality, jurisdiction to hear and determine which is by law now vested in the judges of courts of first instance.' And it is by the same section made the duty of every justice of the peace, when written complaint under oath is made to him that a crime has been committed within his municipality, and there is reason to believe that any person has committed it, or when he has knowledge of facts tending to show the commission of a crime within his municipality by any person, to issue an order for the arrest of the accused, and have him brought before the justice for preliminary examination. Section 2 prescribes the procedure, which accords to the accused the right to examine the complaint and affidavits, to be present and hear and cross-examine the witnesses for the government, to offer witnesses in his own behalf, and give his own testimony if he desires; and 'upon the conclusion of the preliminary investigation, if the justice of the peace is of the opinion that there is reasonable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the accused is guilty thereof, he shall so declare, and shall adjudge that the accused be remanded to jail for safe-keeping to await the action of the judge or court of first instance, unless he give bail, etc. On the other hand, if the justice of the peace be of the opinion that no crime has been committed, or that there is no reasonable ground to \n\n[234 U.S. 91, 97]\n\u00a0\n believe the accused guilty thereof, the justice of the peace shall order the discharge of the accused. Such discharge, however, shall not operate as a final acquittal of the accused, but he may be again arrested and prosecuted for the same offense.'\n It was and is contended by plaintiffs in error that the procedure thus indicated ought to have been followed in their case.\n The prosecution proceeded upon the theory that the above requirements as to preliminary examination and the finding of probable cause were repealed as to the city of Manila by act No. 612 of the Philippine Commission (February 3, 1903),  2 of which provides:\n'In cases triable only in the court of first instance in the city of Manila, the defendant shall have a speedy trial, but shall not be entitled as of right to a preliminary examination in any case where the prosecuting attorney, after a due investigation of the facts, under  39 of the act of which this is an amendment [act No. 183], shall have presented an information against him in proper form: Provided, however, that the court of first instance may make such summary investigation into the case as it may deem necessary to enable it to fix bail or determine whether the offense is bailable.'\n\n Section 39 of the charter act, here referred to, provides:\n'The prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila shall have charge of the prosecution of all crimes, misdemeanors, and violations of city ordinances, in the court of first instance and the municipal courts of the city of Manila. He shall investigate all charges of crimes, misdemeanors, and violations of ordinances, and prepare the necessary informations, or make the necessary complaints against the persons accused, and discharge all other duties in respect to criminal prosecutions enjoined upon provincial fiscals in the general provincial act and the Criminal Code of Pro. cedure. . . . The prosecuting attorney or any \n\n[234 U.S. 91, 98]\n\u00a0\n of his assistants may, if he deems it wise, conduct investigations in respect to crimes, misdemeanors, and violations of ordinances by taking oral evidence of reputed witnesses, and for this purpose may, by subpoena, summon witnesses to appear and testify under oath before him, and the attendance or evidence of an absent or recalcitrant witness may be enforced by application to the municipal court or the court of first instance.'\n\n It was this procedure that was followed in the present case. If act No. 612 is consistent with the Declaration of Rights contained in  5 of the act of Congress of July 1, 1902, there can be no question that it necessarily operates to repeal, with respect to the city of Manila, inconsistent provisions previously in force there, as above mentioned.\n Section 5 of the act of Congress contains no specific requirement of a presentment or indictment by grand jury, such as is contained in the 5th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. And in this respect the Constitution does not, of its own force, apply to the Islands. Hawaii v. Mankichi, \n190 U.S. 197\n, 47 L. ed. 1016, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 787, 12 Am. Crim. Rep. 465; Dorr v. United States, \n195 U.S. 138\n, 49 L. ed. 128, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 808, 1 Ann. Cas. 697; Dowdell v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 325, 332\n, 55 S. L. ed. 753, 757, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 590.\n That the requirement of an indictment by grand jury is not included within the guaranty of 'due process of law' is, of course, well settled. Hurtado v. California, \n110 U.S. 516\n, 28 L. ed. 232, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 111, 292; McNulty v. California, \n149 U.S. 645\n, 37 L. ed. 882, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 959; Dowdell v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 325, 332\n, 55 S. L. ed. 753, 757, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 590; Lem Woon v. Oregon, \n229 \nU.S. 586, 589\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1340, 1341, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 783, and cases cited.\n It is contended that since act No. 612 denies to the inhabitants of Manila the right to a preliminary examination which is accorded to all other people in the Islands, it denies the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the act of Congress. But it was long ago decided that this guaranty does not require territorial uniformity. In Missouri v. Lewis ( Bowman v. Lewis) \n101 \nU.S. 22, 30\n, 25 S. L. ed. 989, 992, this court (by Mr. Justice Bradley) said:\n'The last restriction [of the 14th Amendment], \n\n[234 U.S. 91, 99]\n\u00a0\n as to the equal protection of the laws, is not violated by any diversity in the jurisdiction of the several courts as to subject-matter, amount, or finality of decision, if all persons within the territorial limits of their respective jurisdictions have an equal right, in like cases and under like circumstances, to resort to them for redress. Each state has the right to make political subdivisions of its territory for municipal purposes, and to regulate their local government. As respects the administration of justice, it may establish one system of courts for cities and another for rural districts, one system for one portion of its territory and another system for another portion. Convenience, if not necessity, often requires this to be done, and it would seriously interfere with the power of a state to regulate its internal affairs to deny to it this right. We think it is not denied or taken away by anything in the Constitution of the United States, including the Amendments thereto.'\n\n And see Hayes v. Missouri, \n120 \nU.S. 68, 72\n, 30 S. L. ed. 578, 580, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 350; Chappell Chemical & Fertilizer Co. v. Sulphur Mines Co. \n172 U.S. 474\n, 43 L. ed. 520, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 268; Mallett v. North Carolina, \n181 \nU.S. 589, 598\n, 45 S. L. ed. 1015, 1020, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 730, 15 Am. Crim. Rep. 241.\n It is, however, further contended that act No. 612 only undertakes to deny to the inhabitants of the city the right to a preliminary investigation when the prosecuting attorney sees fit to conduct an ex parte examination, and that it does not cover the subject of probable cause for the arrest of the accused, or affect the right accorded by  12 and 13 of General Orders, No. 58, and by that paragraph of  5 of the act of Congress of July 1, 1902, which declares 'that no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation.' In overruling this contention the supreme court of the Philippine Islands followed its previous rulings in United States v. Wilson, 4 Philippine, 317, 322; United States v. McGovern, 6 Philippine, 621, 623; United States v. Raymundo, 14 Philippine, 416, 436. \n\n[234 U.S. 91, 100]\n\u00a0\n It is insisted that the finding of probable cause is a judicial act, and cannot properly be delegated to a prosecuting attorney. We think, however, that it is erroneous to regard this function, as performed by committing magistrates generally, or under General Orders, No. 58, as being judicial in the proper sense. There is no definite adjudication. A finding that there is no probable cause is not equivalent to an acquittal, but only entitles the accused to his liberty for the present, leaving him subject to rearrest. It is expressly so provided by  14 of General Orders, No. 58, as it is by  2 of act 194, above quoted. Such was the nature of the duty of a committing magistrate in the common-law practice, and it is recognized in Rev. Stat.  1014, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 716. Benson v. McMahon, \n127 \nU.S. 457, 462\n, 463 S., 32 L. ed. 234, 236, 237, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1240; Re Oteiza y Cortes, \n136 \nU.S. 330, 335\n, 34 S. L. ed. 464, 467, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1031, 8 Am. Crim. Rep. 241; Todd v. United States, \n158 \nU.S. 278, 283\n, 39 S. L. ed. 982, 983, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 889. In short, the function of determining that probable cause exists for the arrest of a person accused is only quasi judicial, and not such that, because of its nature, it must necessarily be confided to a strictly judicial officer or tribunal. By  9 of the act of July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 695, chap. 1369), Congress enacted: 'That the supreme court and the courts of first instance of the Philippine Islands shall possess and exercise jurisdiction as heretofore provided and such additional jurisdiction as shall hereafter be prescribed by the government of said Islands, subject to the power of said government to change the practice and method of procedure. The municipal courts of said Islands shall possess and exercise jurisdiction as heretofore provided by the Philippine Commission subject in all matters to such alteration and amendment as may be hereafter enacted by law;' etc. Here we find clear warrant for modifications of the practice and procedure; and since  5 of the same act (quoted above) does not prescribe how 'probable cause' shall be determined, it is, in our opinion, as permissible for the local legislature to confide this duty to a prosecut- \n\n[234 U.S. 91, 101]\n\u00a0\n ing officer as to intrust it to a justice of the peace. Consequently, a preliminary investigation conducted by the prosecuting attorney of the city of Manila, under act No. 612, and upon which he files a sworn information against the party accused, is a sufficient compliance with the requirement 'that no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation.'\n The views above expressed render it unnecessary for us to consider whether the objections thus far dealt with were waived by the plaintiffs in error when they gave bond at the time of their arrest.\n It is next insisted that the conviction of Ocampo was erroneous for want of evidence that he was a proprietor of the newspaper or participated in the publication of the libel. The law is to be found in act No. 277 of the Philippine Commission (Phil. Penal Code 1911, p. 167), of which two sections may be quoted:\n'Sec. 2. Every person who wilfully and with a malicious intent to injure another publishes or procures to be published any libel shall be punished by a fine of not exceeding $2,000, or imprisonment for not exceeding one year, or both.'\n\n'Sec. 6. Every author, editor, or proprietor of any book, newspaper, or serial publication is chargeable with the publication of any words contained in any part of such book or number of each newspaper or serial as fully as if he were the author of the same.'\n\n The evidence abundantly supports the conclusion of the courts below that Coampo was the administrator, manager, and one of the owners of the newspaper known as 'El Renacimiento,' and there was no error in holding him to be a proprietor within the meaning of  6.\n Finally, it is contended that the supreme court of the Philippines had no jurisdiction to increase the punishment of Kalaw. The court was established by act No. 136 of the Philippine Commission (June 11, 1901), with original \n\n[234 U.S. 91, 102]\n\u00a0\n and appellate jurisdiction. By  18 it was given appellate jurisdiction over the courts of first instance; and by  39 it was enacted that 'the existing audiencia or supreme court is hereby abolished, and the supreme court provided by this act is substituted in place thereof.' It is in effect conceded that under the Spanish system the courts of first instance were deemed examining courts, having a sort of preliminary jurisdiction, and that their judgments of conviction or acquittal were not final until the case had been passed upon in the audiencia or supreme court. But it is contended that this was so far changed by General Orders, No. 58,  42, 43, 44, and 50, and by act No. 194 of the Philippine Commission,  4 ( August 10, 1901), that the judgments of the court of first instance are final unless an appeal be taken. And so it was held, with respect to cases other than capital, in Kepner v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 100, 121\n, 49 S. L. ed. 114, 121, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 797, 1 Ann. Cas. 655. But this does not settle the question of the jurisdiction of the supreme court of the Islands where an appeal is taken. In the acts referred to, the right of the government, as well as of the defendant, to appeal from the judgment in a criminal case, was recognized. In the Kepner Case it was held that  5 of the act of Congress of July 1, 1902, in declaring that 'no person for the same offense shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment,' prevented an appeal by the government from a judgment of acquittal in the court of first instance. But in Trono v. United States, \n199 U.S. 521\n, 50 L. ed. 292, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 121, 4 Ann. Cas. 773, where the defendants appealed from a judgment of the court of first instance, which, upon an indictment for murder, had found them guilty of the lower crime of homicide, it was held the supreme court of the Islands had power to reverse the judgment and find the accused guilty of the higher crime of murder; distinguishing the Kepner Case. In Flemister v. United States, \n207 U.S. 372\n, 52 L. ed. 252, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 129, a judgment of the insular supreme court, increasing the sentence imposed by the court of first instance, was affirmed. See \n\n[234 U.S. 91, 103]\n\u00a0\n also Dowdell v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 325, 327\n, 55 S. L. ed. 753, 756, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 590; Pico v. United States, \n228 \nU.S. 225, 230\n, 57 S. L. ed. 812, 814, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 482. In short, the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court of the Philippine Islands in criminal cases is not confined to mere errors of law, but extends to a review of the whole case. And such is the settled practice of that court. United States v. Abijan, 1 Philippine, 83, 85; United States v. Atienza, 1 Philippine, 736, 738.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","159":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOCEANIC STEAM NAV. CO. v.

The facts stated are as follows, with slight abbreviation. The Titanic, a British steamship, which had sailed from Southampton, England, on her maiden voyage for New York, collided on the high seas with an iceberg, on April 14, and sank the next morning, with the loss of many lives and total loss of vessel, cargo, personal effects, mails, and everything connected with the ship except certain lifeboats. The owner, alleging that the loss was occasioned and incurred without its privity or knowledge, filed a petition for limitation of its liability under the laws of the United States (Rev. Stat.  4283-4285, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2943, 2944), and Admiralty Rules 54 and 56. Before it did so a number of actions to recover for loss of life and personal injuries resulting from the disaster had been brought against the petitioners in Federal and state courts. The persons who sustained loss were of many different nationalities, including citizens of the United States. Mellor, a British subject, excepted to the petition, on the ground that 'the acts by reason of which and for which [the petitioner] claims limitation of liability took place on board a British registered vessel on the high seas,' and therefore the law of the United States would not apply. Anderson, a citizen of the United States, excepted on the ground that the law of the United States \n\n[233 U.S. 718, 731]\n\u00a0\n could not and that of England was not shown to apply. The district court dismissed the petition as to these two. 209 Fed. 501. The petitioner appealed, and the circuit court of appeals certified the following questions:\n A. Whether, in the case of a disaster upon the high seas, where (1) only a single vessel of British nationality is concerned and there are claimants of many different nationalities; and where (2) there is nothing before the court to show what, if any, is the law of the foreign country to which the vessel belongs, touching the owner's liability for such disaster,-such owner can maintain a proceeding under  4283-4285, U. S. Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2943, 2944), and the 54th and 56th Rules in Admiralty?\n B. Whether if, in such a case, it appears that the law of the foreign country to which the vessel belongs makes provision for the limitation of the vessel owner's liability, upon terms and conditions different from those prescribed in the statutes of this country, the owners of such foreign vessel can maintain a proceeding in the courts of the United States, under said statutes and rules?\n In the event of the answer to question B being in the affirmative,\n C. Will the courts of the United States in such proceeding enforce the law of the United States or of the foreign country in respect to the amount of such owner's liability?\n The general proposition that a foreign ship may resort to the courts of the United States for a limitation of liability under Rev. Stat.  4283 is established. The Scotland (National Steam Nav. Co. v. Dyer) \n105 U.S. 24\n, 26 L. ed. 1001; La Bourgogne (Deslions v. La Compagnie Generale Transatlantique) \n210 U.S. 95\n, 52 L. ed. 973, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 664. These were cases respectively of collisions between American and English and English and French vessels. See also The Chattahoochee, \n173 U.S. 540\n, 43 L. ed. 801, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 491. The Germanic (Oceanic Steam Nav. Co. v. Aitken) \n196 \nU.S. 589, 598\n, 49 S. L. ed. 610, 614, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 317. But it is argued that there is an exception in a case like this, where only a single foreign ship is concerned. The argument is supported by a quotation from Mr. Justice Bradley in The Scotland, to the effect that if a collision occurred \n\n[233 U.S. 718, 732]\n\u00a0\n on the high seas between two vessels belonging to the same nation, the court would determine the controversy by the law of their flag. For, it is said, if the foreign law would govern in that case, it must govern in this, and therefore, at least, in the absence of allegations bringing the case within the foreign law, the petition must be dismissed. If, in the observation referred to, Mr. Justice Bradley had been speaking of proceedings of this class, it would be important, as sanctioning the view that the United States courts offered a forum concursus for the administration of other systems as well as of our own; but we apprehend that he was speaking of an ordinary collision case, and merely indicating that, in such a case, the principle usually governing foreign torts would apply. That principle may be accepted as equally governing here, but it does not carry us far.\n It is true that the act of Congress does not control or profess to control the conduct of a British ship on the high seas. See American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co. \n213 \nU.S. 347, 356\n, 53 S. L. ed. 826, 832, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 511, 16 Ann. Cas. 1047. It is true that the foundation for a recovery upon a British tort is an obligation created by British law. But it also is true that the laws of the forum may decline altogether to enforce that obligation on the ground that it is contrary to the domestic policy, or may decline to enforce it except within such limits as it may impose. Cuba R. Co. v. Crosby, \n222 \nU.S. 473, 478\n, 480 S., 56 L. ed. 274-276, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 40, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 132; Dicey, Confl. L. 2d ed. 647. It is competent, therefore, for Congress to enact that, in certain matters belonging to admiralty jurisdiction, parties resorting to our courts shall recover only to such extent or in such way as it may mark out. Butler v. Boston & S. S. S. Co., \n130 U.S. 527\n, 32 L. ed. 1017, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 612. The question is not whether the owner of the Titanic by this proceeding can require all claimants to come in, and can cut down rights vested under English law, as against, for instance, Englishmen living in England, who do not appear. It is only whether those who do see \n\n[233 U.S. 718, 733]\n\u00a0\n fit to sue in this country are limited in their recovery irrespective of the English law. That they are so limited results, in our opinion, from the decisions of this court. For on what ground was the limitation of liability allowed in The Scotland or La Bourgogne? Not on their being subject to the act of Congress or any law of the United States in their conduct, but if not on that ground, then it must have been because our statute permits a foreign vessel to limit its liability according to the act when sued in the United States. There may be some little uncertainty in the language of Mr. Justice Bradley in the earlier case. A slight suggestion that the statute is applied because of a vacuum,-the absence of any law properly governing the transaction. But it was no necessary part of his argument that people were to be made liable after the event by the mere choice of forum; and if they were, it would not be because of the act of Congress. That does not impose, but only limits, the liability,-a liability assumed already to exist on other grounds. The essential point was that he limitation might be applied to foreign ships if sued in this country, although they were not subject to our substantive law.\n It is not necessary to consider whether the act of Congress may not limit the rights of shippers or American vessels to recover for injuries in our waters or on the high seas, so that if they sued in a foreign court they could not be allowed to recover more than the act allows, if our construction of the law were followed. A law that limits a right in one case may limit a remedy in another. This statute well might be held to announce a general policy, governing both obligations that arise within the jurisdiction and suits that are brought in the courts of the United States. Emery v. Burrbank, 163 Mass. 326, 328, 28 L.R.A. 57, 47 Am. St. Rep. 456, 39 N. E. 1026. It clearly limits the remedy, as we have shown, in cases where it has nothing to say about the rights. With the explanation that we have made we may repeat here Jus- \n\n[233 U.S. 718, 734]\n\u00a0\n tice Bradley's words: 'The rule of limited responsibility is now our maritime rule. It is the rule by which, through the act of Congress, we have announced that we propose to administer justice in maritime cases.'\n We see no absurdity in supposing that if the owner of the Titanic were sued in different countries, each having a different rule affecting the remedy there, the local rule should be applied in each case. It can be imagined that, in consequence of such diverse proceedings, the owner might not be able to comply with the local requirements for limitation, as it also is conceivable that, if it sought the advantage of an alien law, it might as a condition have to pay more than its liability under the law of its flag in some cases. But the imagining of such possible difficulties is no sufficient reason for not applying the statute as it has been construed, on the whole, it would seem, with good effect.\n It follows from what we have said that the first two questions must be answered in the affirmative, and the third, the law of the United States.\n Answer: A, Yes.\n B, Yes.\n C, The law of the United States.\n Mr. Justice McKenna considers it a proper deduction from The Scotland that the law of the foreign country should be enforced in respect of the amount of the owner's liability. \n\n\n\n","160":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOHIO TAX CASES(1914)\nNo. 642\nArgued: January 7, 1914Decided: February 24, 1914\n\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 576, 578]\n\u00a0\n These suits were brought in the United States district court for the southern district of Ohio (eastern division) by appellants, which are Ohio railroad corporations, to enjoin the certification and collection by appellees of a tax which the state was seeking to enforce upon the privilege of carrying on business in that state. This tax appellants claimed to be in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment, and of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, and also of the preamble and Article 1,  2 and 19 of the Ohio Constitution.\n A restraining order was allowed by the district court, and afterwards appellants' motions for temporary injunctions came on for hearing before three judges, of whom one was a circuit judge, pursuant to  266 of the Judicial Code (36 Stat. at L. 1162, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 236), which went into effect shortly after the bills were filed. The two cases were argued and considered together, upon the facts averred in the bills, which were, for the purposes of the motions, conceded to be true by appellees, and, after consideration, the temporary injunctions were refused. 203 Fed. 537.\n Appellants come direct to this court, under the same section of the Code.\n The tax law in question, the validity of which is attacked generally, and also specially in its application to appellants, was enacted in its present form May 31, 1911. 102 Ohio Laws, 224.\n It created a tax commission, with defined powers, and prescribed various taxes, some upon property and others upon franchises and privileges, with sundry provisions, penal and otherwise, for the collection thereof. Some of \n\n[232 U.S. 576, 579]\n\u00a0\n these taxes were new in Ohio law, others were carried over from previously existing statutes.\n The tax here in question is limited in its operation to certain lines of quasi public business, specifically named in the act and therein referred to as 'public utilities,' including railroads.\n As applied to railroads, the act requires the filing with the tax commission, by each railroad doing business in the state, of a statement, on or before September 1, setting forth, among other things, its 'entire gross earnings, including all sums earned or charged, whether actually received or not, for the year ending on the 30th day of June next preceding, from whatever source derived, for business done within this state, excluding therefrom all earnings derived wholly from interstate business or business done for the Federal government. Such statement shall also contain the total gross earnings of such company for such period in this state from business done within this state.' Sections 81 and 83 of act;  5470 and 5472, General Code of Ohio.\n It is further provided that on the first Monday of October the commission 'shall ascertain and determine the gross earnings as herein provided, of each railroad company whose line is wholly or partially within this state, for the year ending on the 30th day of June next preceding, excluding therefrom all earnings derived wholly from interstate business or business done for the Federal government. The amount so ascertained by the commission shall be the gross earnings of such railroad company for such year.' Section 88 of act;  5477, Gen. Code.\n The act further provides that on the first Monday of November the commission shall certify to the auditor of state the amount of the 'gross earnings so determined' ( 93 of act;  5482, Gen. Code), and that-'in the month of November, the auditor of state shall charge for \n\n[232 U.S. 576, 580]\n\u00a0\n collection, from each railroad company, a sum in the nature of an excise tax, for the privilege of carrying on its intrastate business, to be computed on the amount so fixed and reported to him by the commission, as the gross earnings of such company on its intrastate business for the year . . . by taking 4 per cent of all such gross earnings.' Section 97 of act ;  5486, Gen. Code. The tax is imposed equally and alike on corporations, partnerships, and individuals. Section 39 of act;  5415, Gen. Code.\n Messrs. Robert J. King and F. A.

Hogan, Attorney General of Ohio, for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Pitney:\n\n\n[232 U.S. 576, 586]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n These two cases depend upon practically identical facts, and present the same questions of law.\n The Federal jurisdiction arose because of the Federal questions presented in the record, and did not depend upon diversity of citizenship; and it extends, of course, to \n\n[232 U.S. 576, 587]\n\u00a0\n the determination of all the questions presented, irrespective of the disposition that may be made of the Federal questions.

Rep. 192.\n The right to invoke the equity jurisdiction is clear; for the act specifically makes the tax a lien upon the real estate of appellants, from the cloud of which they sought to free it by the bringing of these actions ( 117 of act;  5506, Gen. Code); and the bills alleged threatened irreparable injury through the enforcement of the penalties and coercive features of the act. Shelton v. Platt, \n139 \nU.S. 591, 598\n, 35 S. L. ed. 273, 277, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 646; Ex parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123\n, 52 L. ed. 714, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441, 14 Ann. Cas. 764.\n The following are the questions to be disposed of:\n First, it is insisted by appellants that under the state Constitution, as construed by the Ohio supreme court in Southern Gum Co. v. Laylin, 66 Ohio St. 578, 64 N. E. 564, the legislature is without power to impose a privilege tax which is in excess of the value of the privilege; that the admitted facts show the present tax upon appellants respectively to be in excess of such value; and that therefore as to them its exaction violates the state Constitution, and amounts to confiscation, and a taking of property without due process of law.\n As to the facts upon which this contention is based, the bill of complaint of the Marietta, Columbus, & Cleveland Railroad Company shows that the tax charged against it for the year 1911 amounts to $2,301.24; that the capital of the company is all, or practically all, invested in its railroad; that this investment was and is a reasonable and proper one; that due care and prudence have been used in the construction, maintenance, and operation of the property and the conduct of the business; that the greatest economy has been and is being practised in the effort to make the railroad yield a fair return upon the investment; but that, notwithstanding these efforts, it has \n\n[232 U.S. 576, 588]\n\u00a0\n never been able to earn, and is now able to earn, from interstate or intrastate business, or both combined, after paying necessary and proper expenses, including taxes other than the excise tax, a return on the investment in its railroad, or on the value thereof, equal to the current rate of return on legitimate high-grade investments at all times readily available in the market; nor have its intrastate earnings, after deducting operating expenses properly attributable thereto, been sufficient to yield a return on that portion of its investment properly attributable to intrastate operations, equal to the current rate of return on legitimate high-grade investments; that, on the contrary, the gross earnings have not been and are not sufficient to pay actual operating expenses, and that this condition will continue to exist during the year which the excise tax is intended to cover.\n The bill of complaint of the Ohio River & Western Railway Company contains similar averments, except as to its inability to pay actual operating expenses. Its tax amounts to $6,653.60.\n The case referred to, Southern Gum Co. v. Laylin, supra, dealt with an act of April 11, 1902, known as the Willis law. The court held it to be an excise or franchise tax, not a property tax, and therefore not subject to the express limitations imposed by the state Constitution upon taxes of the latter kind, but only to such limitations as were to be implied from certain other provisions of the Constitution, respecting which the court said (p. 594):\n'The Constitution was established to 'promote our common welfare.' Preamble to the Constitution. Government is instituted for the equal protection and benefit of the people. Section 2 of the Bill of Rights. Private property shall ever be held inviolate, but subservient to the public welfare. Section 19 of the Bill of Rights. These provisions of the Constitution are implied limitations upon the power of taxation of privileges \n\n[232 U.S. 576, 589]\n\u00a0\n and franchises, and limit such taxation to the reasonable value of the privilege or franchise conferred originally, or to its continued value from year to year. Ashely v. Ryan, 49 Ohio St. 504, 31 N. E. 721; State ex rel. Schwartz v. Ferris, 53 Ohio St. 314, 30 L.R.A. 218, 41 N. E. 579; and Hagerty v. State, 55 Ohio St. 613, 45 N. E. 1046, are examples of taxing the privilege or franchise conferred; while Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Mayer, 28 Ohio St. 521, and Adams Exp. Co. v. State, 55 Ohio St. 69, 44 N. E. 506, are examples of taxing the continued value of the existing privilege or franchise from year to year. These limitations prevent confiscation and oppression under the guise of taxation, and the power of such taxation cannot extend beyond what is for the common or public welfare, and the equal protection and benefit of the people; but the ascertaining and fixing of such values rests largely in the general assembly, but finally in the courts.'\n\n This proposition is carried into the syllabus, which, under the rules of practice of the supreme court, is to be prepared by the judge assigned to prepare the opinion, is to be confined to the points of law arising from the facts of the cause that have been determined by the court, is to be submitted to the judges concurring therein for revisal before its publication, and is to be inserted in the book of reports.\n An examination of the state decisions cited in the Laylin Case, with others referred to in the opinion of the district court and in the briefs of counsel, convinces us that the district court was correct in its conclusion that the state court, in the Laylin Case, dealt with a general law and its operation on all corporations of given classes throughout the state, and not with its effect upon specific financially weak corporations; that it was not intended to hold that the courts as final arbiters might overthrow a law imposing a tax on privileges and franchises merely because in isolated cases such law might impose a hardship, but only that those excise laws whose general operation is confiscatory and oppressive are unconstitutional. \n\n[232 U.S. 576, 590]\n\u00a0\n Nor do we think that from the facts of the present case it is to be inferred that the franchises of plaintiffs in error are valueless merely because it appears that the present earnings of the railroads are not sufficient to pay more than can be derived from legitimate high-grade investment securities that are readily available on the market, or (in the case of one of the roads) are not even sufficient to pay operating expenses. Upon this point we are content to refer to, without repeating, the language employed by Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for this court in State R. Tax Cases, \n92 \nU.S. 575, 606\n, 23 S. L. ed. 663, 670.\n Secondly, it is contended that the act arbitrarily discriminates against plaintiffs in error and other railroad companies in that (a), it does not include all other public utilities carrying on business within the state; those omitted, as is said, being grain elevators, stock yards, ferries, bridge companies, and innkeepers; and (b), the law does not operate uniformly among the utilities that are taxed, since, on electric light, gas, natural gas, water works, telephone, messenger or signal, union depot, heating, coaling, and water transportation companies, the tax amounts to 1.2 per cent of gross intrastate receipts, as to suburban and interurban railroads it is fixed at 1.2 per cent of gross intrastate earnings, and on express and telegraph companies, it is 2 per cent; while on railroads, including plaintiffs in error, it is 4 per cent of such earnings, and the same on pipe line companies.\n Both of these contentions turn upon the familiar question of classification, concerning which so much has been written. We agree with the court below that whether the question be considered in view of the uniformity and equality provisions of the Ohio Constitution, or of the 'equal protection' clause of the 14th Amendment, the result is the same; it cannot be said that the classification rests upon no reasonable and sufficient basis of distinction. State ex rel. Taylor v. Guilbert, 70 Ohio St. 253, 71 N. E. 636, 1 Ann. Cas. 25; Kentucky \n\n[232 U.S. 576, 591]\n\u00a0\n R. Tax Cases, \n115 \nU.S. 321, 337\n, 29 S. L. ed. 414, 419, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 57; Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 33 S. L. ed. 892, 895, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 33; Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Sav. Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 293\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1037, 1042, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 594; Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 U.S. 114\n, 121, et seq. 54 L. ed. 688, 692, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 496.\n In the third place, it is insisted that the act, as applied to railroads, is a burden upon their foreign commerce.\n This contention is rested in part upon the language of  83 and 88, which in terms provide for ascertaining the earnings of the railroad 'from whatever source derived, for business done within this state, excluding therefrom all earnings derived wholly from interstate business or business done for the Federal government.' This, it is argued, has the effect of imposing a tax with respect to the gross receipts from foreign commerce, because such commerce is not expressly excepted. Section 97, however, indicates an intent to take into consideration for the purpose of measuring the excise tax only the earnings upon intrastate business, and it seems clear enough that in the former sections the word 'interstate' was used as meaning 'not intrastate,' rather than in its technically correct signification. Certainly, in the absence of a construction by the state court of last resort to the effect that the receipts from foreign commerce are to be included, and without any attempt on the part of the taxing authorities to include them, the Federal courts ought not to place a construction upon the act that would render it unconstitutional.\n Fourthly, it is contended that the history of the legislation upon the subject shows that the act of May 31, 1911, was really contrived to impose upon the railroad companies a franchise tax proportionate to their interstate commerce, and that such is its actual as well as intended effect.\n It is said that the present act is a reenactment, without material change so far as present purposes are concerned, of an act of March 10, 1910; that prior to the latter act \n\n[232 U.S. 576, 592]\n\u00a0\n a law known as the Cole law was in force, under which each railroad was compelled to pay a tax equal to 1 per centum of its entire gross earnings, computed by multiplying the average gross earnings per mile over the entire system by the number of miles in Ohio; that this act was obnoxious to the 'commerce clause' of the Federal Constitution, for the reasons that entered into the decision of this court in Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Texas, \n210 U.S. 217\n, 52 L. ed. 1031, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638; that after the decision of this case in May, 1908, it was anticipated that the Cole law would probably be held unconstitutional (as it has since been held by an inferior state court in Ohio), and so the legislature contrived the act of March 10, 1910, for the purpose of imposing a tax upon the railroads as heavy as that imposed by the Cole law, while avoiding the form of that enactment; and that for this reason the act of March 10, 1910, increased the percentages in accordance with which the taxes were to be severally determined as follows: Railroads and pipe line companies from 1 to 4 per cent; express and telegraph companies from 1 to 2 per cent; all other utilities from 1 to 1 1-5 per cent; but that instead of taking all the gross earnings, the new percentages were to be applied only to intrastate earnings. It is contended that the increase in the percentages as to railroad and pipe line companies was due to the fact that it was conceived that about three fourths of their business was interstate, and that therefore a tax of 4 per cent on the intrastate earnings would be about equal to a tax of 1 per cent on the total; in other words, that the tax rate was increased fourfold because such utilities were engaged in interstate commerce.\n The tax is, however, in substance as well as in form, an excise or privilege tax. Its reasonableness, unless some Federal right be violated, is within the discretion of the state legislature. We have seen that the classification adopted cannot be deemed illusory; that is, there is no \n\n[232 U.S. 576, 593]\n\u00a0\n apparent violation of the equality provisions of the state Constitution or of the 'equal protection' clause of the 14th Amendment, although railroad and pipe line companies are required to pay at the rate of 4 per cent of the annual intrastate earnings, while other public-service corporations pay a less percentage. It is, of course, entirely settled that a state cannot, consistently with the Federal control of interstate commerce, lay such taxes, either upon property rights or upon franchises or privileges, as in effect to burden such commerce. But the line is not always easily drawn, as recent cases sufficiently show. Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 225\n, 229 S., 52 L. ed. 1031, 1036, 1038, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638; United States Exp. Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 \nU.S. 335, 344\n, 56 S. L. ed. 459, 464, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 211; Williams v. Talladega, \n226 \nU.S. 404, 416\n, 57 S. L. ed. 275, 280, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 116; Baltic Min. Co. v. Massachusetts, \n231 \nU.S. 68, 82\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 15.\n The present act does not on its face manifest a purpose to interfere with interstate commerce, and we are unable to accept the historical facts alluded to as sufficient evidence of a sinister purpose, such as would justify this court in striking down the law. We could not do this without in effect denouncing the legislature of the state as guilty of a conscious attempt to evade the obligations of the Federal Constitution. Assuming the law was changed in 1910 because of a fear that the Cole law would be held unconstitutional, the mere fact that, while excluding interstate earnings from the multiplicand, the multiplier was increased, is not of itself deemed sufficient evidence of an unlawful effort to burden a privilege that is not a proper subject of state taxation.\n Fifthly, it is contended that the act is in effect a double tax upon property, and hence lacking in the uniformity required by the state Constitution. But, as was pointed out by the district court, the exaction of 4 per cent of the gross intrastate earnings is not a property tax, but an excise tax, whose amount is fixed and measured by such earnings; and double taxation in a legal sense does not \n\n[232 U.S. 576, 594]\n\u00a0\n exist unless the double tax is levied upon the same property within the same jurisdiction. Plaintiffs in error pay one tax with respect to property, another with respect to the privilege or occupation; hence the taxation is not double. Bradley v. Bauder, 36 Ohio St. 28, 35, 38 Am. Rep. 547; Southern Gum Co. v. Laylin, 66 Ohio St. 578, 596, 64 N. E. 564.\n The so-called double tax is also laid hold of as a ground for the contention that there is a denial of equal protection within the meaning of the 14th Amendment. This, however, is but another form of the objection to the classification, which has already been disposed of.\n Finally, it is contended that the act is unconstitutional because of the severity of the penalties imposed for withholding the tax. But these actions do not involve any present attempt to enforce the penalties; and the act contains a section (160) which in terms declares: 'The sections of this act, and every part of such sections, are hereby declared to be independent sections and parts of sections, and the holding of any section or part thereof to be void or ineffective shall not affect any other section or part thereof.'

Gladden, Otto Kueffner, and Albert Schaller for petitioner.\n Messrs. William H. Pitzer and William Hayward for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit was brought by the Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey, a corporation of that state, to establish its title to personal property left by Augustin Wirth, deceased, a member of the Order, who died at Springfield, Minnesota, in December, 1901. The defendant Albert Steinhauser as administrator of the estate of the decedent, holding letters from the probate court of Brown county, Minnesota, filed a cross bill asserting ownership in his representative capacity, and praying discovery and account with respect to whatever part of the estate had come into the complainant's possession. The circuit court entered a decree dismissing the cross bill and granting the relief sought by the complainant's bill. 179 Fed. 137. The circuit court of appeals reversed this decree, directing the dismissal of the original bill and the granting of the prayer of the cross bill. 114 C. C. A. 249, 194 Fed. 289. Certiorari was allowed.\n The monastic brotherhood known as the Order of St. Benedict was established by St. Benedict in the early part of the sixth century at Subiaco, Italy, whence it spread over western Europe. It was brought to the United States in 1846. The members of the brotherhood follow what is known as 'the rule of St. Benedict,' a collection \n\n[234 U.S. 640, 642]\n\u00a0\n of mandates essentially unchanged from the beginning. The vows are those of obedience, stability, chastity, and poverty.\n We are not concerned in the present case with any question of ecclesiastical requirement or monastic discipline. The question is solely one of civil rights. The claim in suit rests upon the constitution of the complainant corporation, and the obligations inherent in membership.\n The Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey was incorporated in 1868 by special act of the legislature of that state. The incorporators were described as 'being a society of religious men, living in community, and devoted to charitable works and the education of youth.' The corporation was empowered to hold property and to make by-laws for the government of the Order, provided that these should not be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States or of the state of New Jersey, that the clear yearly income of the real estate should not exceed a sum stated, and that no one should remain an incorporator 'except regular members of said religious society, living in community, and governed by the laws thereof.' Under this charter the Order adopted a constitution, among the provisions of which are the following:\n'Section 11. Membership is lost at once:\n\n'1. By being dismissed according to the disciplinary statutes of the Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey, approved of by Pope Pius IX. for the American Cassinese Congregation of Benedictines.\n\n'2. By voluntary leaving the Order for any purpose whatsoever.\n\n'3. By joining any other order or secret society, or any other religious denominations.\n\n'Section 12. Since the Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey is solely a charitable institution, the real estate of said order and the individual earnings of its members are and must be considered as common property of the \n\n[234 U.S. 640, 643]\n\u00a0\n Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey, from which the members of said Order derive their support, and the balance of which income and property should serve for the following up and carrying out of the charitable objects of the Order.\n\n'It is therefore agreed upon by all the members of the said Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey that no member can or will claim at any time or under any circumstances more than their decent support for the time for which they are members of the Charter of the Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey, and no further.\n\n'And moreover, that each member individually pledges himself to have all property which he now holds or hereafter may hold in his own name conveyed as soon as possible to the legal title of the Order of St. Benedict ofNew Jersey.'\n\n Augustin Wirth was born in Bavaria in 1828. He came to this country in 1851; and, in the next year, he took the solemn vows of the Order at St. Vincent's Abbey in Pennsylvania, and was ordained to the priesthood. For a few years he had charge of a church at Greenburgh, Pennsylvania, near St. Vincent's, and in 1857 he went to Kansas, where he established a college and a church which afterwards became an abbey. He continued his work in Kansas until 1868, and then was sent to Minnesota, where he remained until 1875. He then resumed his pastorate at Greenburgh, Pennsylvania, and later had charge of a parish at Elizabeth, New Jersey, until 1887. It is evident that while in Kansas he had joined the monastery of St. Benedict there established, and in 1887, with the permission of both Abbots, he transferred his stability to St. Mary's Abbey in Newark, New Jersey, the home of the complainant, the New Jersey Order, of which he thus became a member. He remained continuously at this Abbey for about two years, until 1889; he was in illhealth and was taken care of by the Order. He was then sent to a church in Wilmington, Delaware, and after a few \n\n[234 U.S. 640, 644]\n\u00a0\n months he returned to his pastorate in Elizabeth, New Jersey, in which he continued until 1897. After traveling for some time in Europe for his health, visiting Rome and various monasteries, he took a parish, in 1898, at Springfield, Minnesota, with the requisite permission ad tempus from the Abbot of St. Mary's; and there he remained until his death. At the request of the New Jersey Abbot he was buried in the cemetery of the Benedictine Order in Minnesota. The circuit court found that his membership in the complainant Order continued to the last, and this finding was not disturbed by the circuit court of appeals. We regard the fact as satisfactorily established. His absence from the Abbey when engaged in pastoral work was upon the consent of the Abbot, and he was subject to recall at any time.\n Father Wirth published many works on religious subjects. He obtained copyrights for his books, and made his contract with the publishers, in the name of 'Augustine Wirth, O. S. B.' The property here in question consists chiefly of the proceeds received from sales of these books ( including notes and mortgages in which they had been invested), credits on account of sales made before and after his death, and the copyrights. He received the royalties personally during his lifetime; and after his death, until October 17, 1906 (when suit was brought against the publishers by the administrator), the accruing royalties were paid to the complainant. The New Jersey Order also, through the Abbot of St. John's Abbey in Minnesota, collected certain sums on outstanding notes held by the decedent, and paid therefrom the decedent's debts.\n It is clear that, according to the principles of the complainant's organization, Father Wirth was not entitled to retain for his own benefit either the moneys which he received for his services in the various churches with which he was connected, or those which he derived from \n\n[234 U.S. 640, 645]\n\u00a0\n the sale of his books. By the explicit provision of the constitution of the complainant ( 12), it was a necessary consequence of his continued membership, that his gains-from whatever source-belonged to it, and that, as against the complainant, he could not assert title to the property which he received. The claim of the Order, based upon this conception of its rights, is resisted upon the grounds, (1) that the decedent had the permission of the Abbot to retain, as his own property, the proceeds of the sales of his books, and (2) that the obligation sought to be enforced by the complainant is void as being against public policy.\n\n 1. \nWhile there was evidence that Father Wirth was required to account to the Abbot for the salary and perquisites received in his church work, it appeared that the income from his books was treated in a different manner. This income he was allowed to retain and use. When he joined the complainant, in 1887, he did not make a transfer of any property to the Order, although already he had some property as a result of his literary labors. The evidence showed that he made loans and investments; and from the moneys in his hands, he paid his personal expenses, including his outlays on his visit to Europe. Because of his going to Rome without leave, and his expenditures on this trip, he was admonished by the Abbot Primate, O. S. B., who had already written to the Abbot of St. Mary's that Father Wirth should be required to account. But no such account was given, and it would seem that such disagreements as arose between the decedent and his ecclesiastical superiors in this country related to church moneys, and not to the proceeds of book sales. The circuit court of appeals, disagreeing with the finding of the circuit court, concluded that Father Wirth was permitted by the Abbot of St. Vincent's, and by the complainant's Abbot, to retain these proceeds as his own property. \n\n[234 U.S. 640, 646]\n\u00a0\n It is undisputed that the decedent did have a special permission with respect to the use of this income. Originally given by the Abbot of St. Vincent's, it was continued by the Abbot of St. Mary's. It was given in recognition of the fact that his literary work was in addition to the duties which he was normally required to perform. But, as we think, the conclusion of the court below does not give proper weight to the testimony as to the nature and scope of the privilege thus accorded. It was explicitly testified by the Abbot that Father Wirth was permitted to keep the moneys in question, not as his own, but to have their use for charitable purposes with the permission of his superiors. It was this permission which was originally given and which the complainant's Abbot renewed. This testimony was not controverted, and, in view of the constitution of the Order, we find no ground for treating the permission as being of a different character. It is said that it does not appear how the decedent, while in Minnesota, for example, could have expended the money for the charitable purposes of the Order in New Jersey. But the purposes of this Order were broadly charitable and religious; the decedent prosecuted his educational and religious work with the Abbot's consent, and the use of these moneys for charitable purposes, wherever he was located for the time, might well be in furtherance of the objects of the Order. It may have been the concession of a special privilege to permit the decedent to act directly in the distribution of the moneys which he had earned by his additional labors, instead of turning them over to the head of the Order, but we cannot say that it was a permission without restriction, or one which essentially altered his relation to the Order and his fundamental duty while he remained a member of it.\n On the contrary, we agree with the circuit court, not only in its finding of fact that the permission was limited as stated, but also in its holding that, in view of the basic \n\n[234 U.S. 640, 647]\n\u00a0\n law of the organization, there is no warrant for the conclusion that the Abbot had any authority to allow Father Wirth to assert an independent title, or to hold the property as absolutely his own. It is said that the 'Rule of St. Benedict' recognizes the right of the member of the Order to keep whatever the Abbot permits him to have. But this plainly refers to the necessities of life, and not to accumulations in direct antagonism to the principles of the society. Whatever indulgence may have been shown to the decedent with respect to the submission of appropriate accounts, it cannot be said that while his membership continued he had, or could have, the privilege of accumulating an individual estate for his own benefit and free from his obligations to the Order. This could not but be regarded as violative of the constitution of the complainant, and beyond the competency of its official head to grant.\n\n 2. \nWe are thus brought to the question whether the requirement, which lies at the foundation of this suit, is void as against public policy; that is, whether, by reason of repugnance to the essential principles of our institutions, the obligation, though voluntarily assumed, and the trust arising from it, cannot be enforced. In support of this view, it seems to be premised that a member of the Order can be absolved from his vows only by the action of the Head of the Church; and that unless the requisite dispensation is thus obtained the member is bound for life in temporal, as well as in spiritual, affairs. This, it is said, is the necessary import of testimony given by the Abbot. It is thus assumed that the vows in connection with the 'Rule' bind the member in complete servitude to the Order for life, or until the Head of the Church absolves him from his obligations; and it is concluded that an agreement for such a surrender, being opposed to individual liberty and to the inherent right of every person to acquire and hold property, is unenforceable in the civil \n\n[234 U.S. 640, 648]\n\u00a0\n courts, and cannot form the basis for an equitable title in the complainant.\n This argument, we think, disregards the explicit provision of the complainant's constitution as to voluntary withdrawal. It overlooks the distinction between civil and ecclesiastical rights and duties; between the Order of St. Benedict of New Jersey, a corporation of that state, and the monastic brotherhood subject to church authority; between the obligation imposed by the corporate organization and religious vows. As we have said, the question here is not one of canon law or ecclesiastical polity. The requirement of complainant's constitution must be read according to its terms, and its validity must be thus determined. Granted that it is to be examined in the light of that to which it refers, still, obligations which are inconsistent with its express provisions cannot be imported into it. This constitution, as already stated, definitely provides: 'Membership is lost at once:-- 2. By voluntary leaving the Order for any purpose whatsoever' ( 11.) This language cannot be taken to mean other than what it distinctly says. So far as the corporation, and the civil rights and obligations incident to membership therein, are concerned, it leaves no doubt that the member may voluntarily leave the Order at any time. His membership in the corporation, and the obligation he assumes, are subject to that condition. If he severs his connection with the corporation, it cannot be heard to claim any property he may subsequently acquire. His obligation runs with his membership, and the latter may be terminated at will.\n With this privilege of withdrawal expressly recognized, we are unable to say that the agreement expressed in  12 of the complainant's constitution, that the gains and acquisitions of members shall belong to the corporation, must be condemned. These go to the corporation in exchange for the privileges of membership, and \n\n[234 U.S. 640, 649]\n\u00a0\n to further the common purpose to which the members are devoted. No constitutional right is invaded and no statutory restriction is transgressed. The legislature of New Jersey, which, subject to constitutional inhibition, is the arbiter of the public policy of that state, granted the charter by special act to the Benedictine Society of 'religious men living in community,' and it cannot be said that the constitution adopted by the Order was repugnant to the charter provisions, or exceeded the authority plainly intended to be conferred. It would seem to be clear that the obligation assumed, instead of being opposed to the public policy of the state where it was created, was directly sanctioned.\n The validity of agreements providing for community ownership with renunciation of individual rights of property during the continuance of membership in the community, where there is freedom to withdraw, has repeatedly been affirmed. The case of Goesele v. Bimeler, 14 How. 589, 14 L. ed. 554, related to a religious society called Separatists. By an agreement made in 1819, the members of the society agreed to unite in a 'communion of property.' They renounced 'all individual ownership of property, present or future, real or personal.' Amendatory articles of like import were signed in 1824. As to these agreements, the court said: 'The articles of 1819 and 1824 are objected to as not constituting a contract which a court of equity would enforce. . . . What is there in either of these articles that is contrary to good morals, or that is opposed to the policy of the laws? An association of individuals is formed under a religious influence, who are in a destitute condition, having little to rely on for their support but their industry; and they agree to labor in common for the good of the society, and a comfortable maintenance for each individual; and whatever shall be acquired beyond this shall go to the common stock. This contract provides for every member of the \n\n[234 U.S. 640, 650]\n\u00a0\n community, in sickness and in health, and under whatsoever misfortune may occur. . . . By disclaiming all individual ownership of the property acquired by their labor, for the benefits secured by the articles, the members give durability to the fund accumulated, and to the benevolent purposes to which it is applied. No legal objection is perceived to such a partnership.' (Id. pp. 606, 607.) In Schwartz v. Duss, \n187 U.S. 8\n, 47 L. ed. 53, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 4, the controversy related to the property of the Harmony Society, a community in Pennsylvania. It was said that the cardinal principle of the society was 'self-abnegation' which was manifested 'not only by submission to a religious head, but by a community instead of individual ownership of property, and the dedication of their labor to the society.' It had been held by the supreme court of Pennsylvania that the agreements constituting the community were not offensive to the public policy of that state (Schriber v. Rapp, 5 Watts, 351, 30 Am. Dec. 327), and, as to this, it was said by this court: 'The supreme court observed that the point made against the articles as being against public policy was attended with no difficulty, and Chief Justice Gibson said for the court: 'An association for the purposes expressed is prohibited neither by statute nor the common law.\" (Id. p. 26.) In Burt v. Oneida Community, 137 N. Y. 346, 19 L.R.A. 297, 33 N. E. 307, in describing the character of that society, the court of appeals of New York said that its main purpose was the 'propagandism of certain communistic views as to the acquisition and enjoyment of property' and 'the endeavor to put into practical operation an economic and industrial scheme which should embody and illustrate the doctrines which they held and inculcated.' 'Necessarily' said the court, 'the basic proposition of such a community was the absolute and complete surrender of the separate and individual rights of property of the persons entering it; the abandonment of all purely selfish pursuits, and the investiture of the title to their \n\n[234 U.S. 640, 651]\n\u00a0\n property and the fruits of their industry in the common body, from which they could not afterwards be severed or withdrawn except by unanimous consent. It was fashioned according to the pentecostal ideal, that all who believed should be together and have all things common. It was intended to be in fact, as they frequently styled themselves, but a single family upon a large scale, with only one purse, where self was to be abjured and the general good alone considered.' The court, viewing it solely as a business undertaking, held that the organization 'was not prohibited by any statute, or in contravention of any law regulating the possession, ownership, or tenure of property.' See also Speidel v. Henrici, \n120 U.S. 377\n, 30 L. ed. 718, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 610; Gasely v. Separatists Soc. 13 Ohio St. 144; Waite v. Merrill, 4 Me. 102, 16 Am. Dec. 238; Gass v. Wilhite, 2 Dana, 170, 26 Am. Dec. 446; State v. Amana Soc. 132 Iowa, 304, 109 N. W. 894, 8 L.R.A.( N.S.) 909, note, 11 Ann. Cas. 236, note.\n It is said that in these cases, the contracts had been fully performed, and that the effort was made either to partition or distribute the property of the society, or to recover the value of property which had been actually conveyed, or services which had been rendered to it. But the validity of the agreements there in question, against the objection based upon public policy, was distinctly recognized.\n In the present case, there was no infringement of Father Wirth's liberty or right to property. He did not withdraw from the Order. He had agreed, by accepting membership under the complainant's constitution, that his individual earnings and acquisitions, like those of other members, should go into the common fund, and, except as required for the maintenance of the members, should be used in carrying out the charitable objects of the Order. It is not unlikely that the copyrights upon his books derived their commercial value largely, if not altogether, from his membership. Certainly, the equitable ownership of these copyrights, by virtue of his obligation, vested in the com- \n\n[234 U.S. 640, 652]\n\u00a0\n plainant, and the moneys in question when received became in equity its property and were subject to its disposition. As to both, Father Wirth stood in the position of a trustee.\n The further objection that the claim is barred by the statute of limitations was held by the circuit court to be untenable, and we agree with that view. The applicable limitation is six years (Minn. Rev. Laws 1905,  4076), and the bill was filed within six years after Father Wirth's death. There is no such clear evidence of repudiation of the trust as would warrant the conclusion that the statute began to run at an earlier date.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the Circuit Court is affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","162":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOVERTON v.

And this is also true of the contention that there is jurisdiction because the facts establish that the conclusion of guilt could only have been reached by plainly disregarding the proof as to the character of the shipment, thus in fact applying the statute to interstate commerce,1 since the record affords no justification for the assumption upon which the proposition rests.\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Kansas City Southern R.

CO.(1914)\nNo. 181\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1914\n\n\n\n Mr. Walter Bennett for appellants.\n Messrs. James F. Mack and John B. Wright for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action brought by the appellants upon a promissory note for $265,416.72, made by the appellee. The defense is want of consideration, and depends upon the question whether certain payments made by one Moneuse were made by way of loan or for the purchase of stock; the note having been issued as for a loan to the company. The material facts are few. An earlier company, into the shoes of which the appellee has stepped, was in bankruptcy, and Moneuse, a stockholder, was suing certain others for the return to the company of a large part of the stock. On June 4, 1903, a compromise was made, reciting as one ground that the company owned mining claims which in the opinion of all the parties, were of great value, but which the company was in great danger \n\n[232 U.S. 595, 596]\n\u00a0\n of losing unless money was raised to work them. Moneuse agreed to 'provide and supply' enough money to 'pay off and discharge' the company's debts, and to work the company's mines for not more than three years until they paid for working themselves. He was to get the company out of bankruptcy and into possession of its property, subject to certain mortgages. The others were to get 50 per cent of the authorized stock into the treasury, and this amount, less what already was held by Moneuse, the company was to issue and deliver to him 'in consideration of the advance by [him] of the moneys which are to be paid and advanced by him, as above provided for, and without further consideration whatsoever.' Moneuse also was to have control.\n This agreement was carried out and the total disbursements of Moneuse were more than the amount of the note. Nine months after the compromise a stockholders' meeting suthorized a transfer of the company's property to the appellee on the condition, among others, that it should 'assume and discharge the indebtedness of this company to Elie J. Moneuse;' but on February 29, 1904, the characterization of the advance as a loan and the portion of the resolutions quoted were 'withdrawn and rescinded' at the suggestion and with the concurrence and vote of Moneuse. Afterwards, on July 17, 1907, Moneuse being still in control of the company, the note in suit was issued. The case was tried on behalf of intervening minority stockholders without a jury. The trial court found for the defendant, and the judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the territory. 13 Ariz. 406, 114 Pac. 964.\n It cannot be said that the finding was wrong as matter of law. It is true that the agreement speaks of the money that was to be furnished by Moneuse as an 'advance' by him, but it was an advance to pay off the company's debts, not merely to change the creditor. The clause that throws the clearest light upon the meaning is the recitation \n\n[232 U.S. 595, 597]\n\u00a0\n that the company's mining claims were of great value in the opinion of all the parties to the contract. That being so, it was natural that a stockholder who had the money should be willing to pay off certain debts ( about $45,000) as a consideration for getting the greater part of the stock, and should be willing to work the mines for a time if he had the company and the duration of the experiment under his control. It would seem to have been less natural for the other stockholders to part with the larger share in the rights they deemed so valuable simply as a bonus to induce Moneuse to take the former creditors' place and try his hand at the work. There are set forth in the statement some facts that we have not reproduced, because we think it unnecessary, in view of the present position of the case. It is enough to say that, in our opinion, the appellants would not profit by a fuller consideration. The meaning of the arrangement, to which neither company was a party, seems to have been matter for a finding. Rankin v. Fidelity Ins. Trust & S. D.

He brings the case to this court on the ground that the statute is contrary to the 14th Amendment and also is in contravention of the treaty between the United States and Italy, to which latter country the plaintiff in error belongs.\n Under the 14th Amendment the objection is two fold; unjustifiably depriving the alien of property, and discrimination against such aliens as a class. But the former really depends upon the latter, since it hardly can be disputed that if the lawful object, the protection of wild life ( Geer v. Connecticut, \n161 U.S. 519\n, 40 L. ed. 793, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 600), warrants the discrimination, the means adopted for making it effective also might be adopted. The possession of rifles and shotguns is not necessary for other purposes not within the statute. It is so peculiarly appropriated to the forbidden use that if such a use may be denied to this class, the possession of the instruments desired chiefly for that end also may be. The prohibition does not extend to weapons such as pistols that may be supposed to be needed occasionally for self-defense. So far, the case is within the principle of Lawton v. Steele, \n152 U.S. 133\n, 38 L. ed. 385, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 499. \n\n[232 U.S. 138, 144]\n\u00a0\n See further, New York ex rel. Silz v. Hesterberg, \n211 U.S. 31\n, 53 L. ed. 75, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 10; Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, \n226 U.S. 192\n, 57 L. ed. 184, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44.\n The discrimination undoubtedly presents a more difficult question. But we start with the general consideration that a state may classify with reference to the evil to be prevented, and that if the class discriminated against is or reasonably might be considered to define those from whom the evil mainly is to be feared, it properly may be picked out. A lack of abstract symmetry does not matter. The question is a practical one, dependent upon experience. The demand for symmetry ignores the specific difference that experience is supposed to have shown to mark the class. It is not enough to invalidate the law that others may do the samething and go unpunished, if, as a matter of fact, it is found that the danger is characteristic of the class named. Lindsley v. National Carbonic Gas Co. \n220 \nU.S. 61, 80\n, 81 S., 55 L. ed. 369, 378, 379, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912 C, 160. The state 'may direct its law against what it deems the evil as it actually exists without covering the whole field of possible abuses.' Central Lumber Co. v.

Barrett v. Indiana, \n229 \nU.S. 26, 29\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1050, 1052, 33 Sup. Ct.

Milwaukee, \n228 \nU.S. 572, 583\n, 57 S. L. ed. 971, 977, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 610. If we might trust popular speech in some states it was right; but it is enough that this court has no such knowledge of local conditions as to be able to say that it was manifestly \n\n[232 U.S. 138, 145]\n\u00a0\n wrong.

Cas. 514.\n The defense under the treaty with Italy of February 26, 1871 (17 Stat. at L. 845), appears to us to present less difficulty. The provisions relied upon are those in article 2, giving to citizens of Italy the right to carry on trade and to do anything incident to it upon the same terms as the natives of this country; in article 3, assuring them security for persons and property, and that they 'shall enjoy in this respect the same rights and privileges as are or shall be granted to the natives, on their submitting themselves to the conditions imposed upon the natives;' and in article 24, promising to the Kingdom of Italy the same favors in respect to commerce and navigation that may be granted to other nations. We will say a word about each.\n The last article is supposed to make applicable a convention with Switzerland providing against more burdensome conditions being imposed upon the residence of Swiss than upon that of citizens. But article 24 refers only to commerce and navigation, and the case must stand wholly upon articles 2 and 3. As to article 2, it will be time enough to consider whether the statute can be construed or upheld as precluding Italians from possessing a stock of guns for purposes of trade when such a case is presented. The act was passed for an object with which possession in the way of trade has nothing to do, and well might be interpreted as not extending to it. There remains, then, only article 3. With regard to that it was pointed out below that the equality of rights that it assures is equality only in respect of protection and security for persons and property. The prohibition of a particular kind of destruction and of acquiring property in instruments intended for that purpose establishes no inequality in either respect. It is to be remembered that the subject of this whole discussion is wild game, which the state may preserve for \n\n[232 U.S. 138, 146]\n\u00a0\n its own citizens if it pleases. Geer v. Connecticut, \n161 \nU.S. 519, 529\n, 40 S. L. ed. 793, 797, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 600.

PHILADELPHIA & R R CO(1914)\nNo. 469\nArgued: December 3, 1913Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[231 U.S. 675, 676]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George Demming for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. William Clarke Mason and Charles Heebner for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Action for $50,000 damages brought by plaintiff in error, herein called plaintiff, against defendant in error, the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company, herein called defendant, in the district court of the United States, eastern district of Pennsylvania. It was tried to a jury which, under the direction of the court, rendered a verdict for defendant. Judgment was duly entered upon the verdict and it was affirmed by the eircuit court of appeals.\n Defendant is a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce. The intestate of plaintiff was employed by it in the capacity of fireman on one of its locomotives, and, it is alleged, came to his death by the failure of defendant to comply with the requirements of the safety appliance acts of Congress and the rules and directions of the Interstate Commerce Commission for mulated and proclaimed thereunder, in that defendant failed to affix between the locomotive and its tender an automatic coupling device. The action is prosecuted under the act of April 22, 1908 [35 Stat. at L. 66, chap. 149], as amended April 5, 1910 [36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1324], relating to the liability of common carriers by railroad engaged in interstate commerce to their employees while so engaged.\n The train was composed of forty-four cars, some loaded and some empty, and the engine, tender, and caboose. The coupling between the cars was automatic, that between the engine and the tender was a drawbar and pin. The pin broke in consequence of the air hose breaking or parting between the first and second cars from the caboose, thereby setting the brakes on the whole train. By the \n\n[231 U.S. 675, 677]\n\u00a0\n breaking of the coupling between the tender and the engine, Pennell, plaintiff's intestate, was thrown from the train upon the track and killed on December 31, 1911. The train at the time of the accident was going about 15 miles an hour.\n The act of Congress provides: 'It shall be unlawful for any such common carrier [railroad engaged in interstate commerce] to haul or permit to be hauled or used on its line any car used in moving interstate traffic, not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars.' [27 Stat. at L. 531, chap. 196,  2, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3174.]\n The first contention of plaintiff is that the primary object of the act is, quoting from its title, 'to promote the safety of employees and travelers upon railroads;' and that therefore the language of the act 'should be so applied and construed in matters relating to the protection of railroad workmen as to specific railroad accidents.' In other words, the purpose of the act, it is contended, is to protect all employees, of whatever class, and the mere absence of an automatic coupler, if accident and injury result to an employee, is enough for liability. But plaintiff does not quote all of the title. The complete title is, 'An Act to Promote the Safety of Employees and Travelers upon Railroads by Compelling Common Carriers Engaged in Interstate Commerce to Equip Their Cars with Automatic Couplers and Continuous Brakes, and Their Locomotives with Driving-Wheel Brakes, and for Other Purposes.' The provisions of the act correspond to the purpose declared in the title, and may be applied distributively to the protection of employee or traveler, or to employees, according to their employment.\n But even if the act has the broad purpose asserted, which we need not decide, we are brought to the question, Is the tender of a locomotive a car within the meaning of the statute? \n\n[231 U.S. 675, 678]\n\u00a0\n Plaintiff asserts the affirmative of the question and cites Johnson v. Southern P. Co. \n196 U.S. 1\n, 49 L. ed. 363, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 158, 17 Am. Neg. Rep. 412, and a number of state decisions. The case does not so decide. It does decide that the locomotive is a car within the meaning of the act. No distinction was made between it and the tender; the latter was deemed integral with the locomotive. In other words, tender and engine were considered as constituting the locomotive. Necessarily a locomotive thus constituted was decided to be a 'car' within the meaning of the act, and necessarily had to be coupled with the cars, which constituted the train. And in this necessity the dangers to employees would occur which the act was intended to prevent. Any other construction would have left the act denuded of some of its value. In other words, there would have been only a partial enforcement of its protection in instances where protection was oftenest needed. To omit the locomotive, composed of engine and tender-and it was considered as so composed in the cited case-was to omit part of a train which was within all the mischiefs of the act, and therefore covered by its remedies. No such conditions exist in the present case. Engine and tender are a single thing; separable, it may be, but never separated in their ordinary and essential use. The connection between them, that is, between the engine and tender, it was testified, was in the nature of a permanent coupling, and it was also testified that there was practically no opening between the engine and tender, and that attached to the engine was a drawbar which fitted in the yoke of the tender, and the pin was dropped down to connect drawbar and yoke. The necessary deduction from this is that no dangerous position was assumed by an employee in coupling the engine and tender for the reason that the pin was dropped through the bar from the tank of the tender. The case at bar, therefore, is not brought either within the mischief or the remedy of the act. \n\n[231 U.S. 675, 679]\n\u00a0\n The evidence established that it is not the custom of railroads to use an automatic coupler between the engine and tender. Some roads, however, use two additional or supplemental drawbars, called radial bars, one on each side of the main bar, while on other roads it is almost the standard practice, instead of the supplemental bars, to use chains secured to the back heads of the locomotive and hooked to the tender on each side of the center. The record does not disclose whether there were either such bars or chains connecting the engine and tender. But even if their absence may be inferred, it is not relied on as a ground of negligence.\n It is further contended by plaintiff that the necessity of an automatic coupler between engine and tender is determined by the amendment of the act of 1893, enacted in 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 943, chap. 976, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1314). It may be necessary, it is said, under the statute of 1893, to 'bring the word 'tender' within the definition of the word 'car,\" but that this 'is totally unnecessary when we come to consider and apply the subsequent statutes, because here we find the word 'tender' specifically used, and used, too, in evident contradistinction to the words 'locomotives' and 'cars.\" The amendment repeats the title of the prior acts, provides that their provisions 'shall apply in all cases, whether or not the couplers brought together are of the same kind, make, or type,' and that their provisions and requirements, including automatic couplers, 'shall be held to apply to all trains, locomotives, tenders, cars, and smaller vehicles on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce.' But this act does not destroy the integrity of the locomotive and tender. It is entirely satisfied by requiring the automatic coupler between the tender and the cars constituting the trian, that is, to the rear end of the tender. And this requirement fulfils the purpose of the statute, which, we have seen, does not regard the \n\n[231 U.S. 675, 680]\n\u00a0\n strength of the connections between the cars, even if it may be supposed that an automatic coupler is the stronger, but does regard safety in making and unmaking the connections. This being kept in mind, the construction of the statute is not difficult. And the construction of the statute is the main concern. If it is not mandatory, as we think it is not, of an automatic coupler between the engine and the tender, the contentions of plaintiff are without foundation. We need not refer to them with further detail except to say that the custom of the railroads could not, of course, justify a violation of the statute, but that custom, having the acquiescence of the Interstate Commerce Commission, is persuasive of the meaning of the statute.\n Under the various safety appliance acts the Commission is charged with the duty of prosecuting violations of them which come to its knowledge, and by the sundry civil appropriation act of June 28, 1902 [32 Stat. at L. 419, chap. 1301], the Commission was authorized to employ inspectors to execute and enforce the requirements of the acts. It is of special significance, therefore, that in its order under the act of April 14, 1910 [36 Stat. at L. 298, chap. 160, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1327], which was supplemental of the other acts, designating the number, dimensions, location, and manner of application of certain appliances, it provided as follows: 'Couplers: Locomotives shall be equipped with automatic couplers at rear of tender and front of locomotive.' That is, couplers were required where danger might be incurred by the employees.\n The state decisions cited by plaintiff to sustain her definition of a car, we do not think it is necessary to review. They are all cited in Johnson v. Southern P. Co. supra. They applied the principle which we have applied, and construed the states passed on according to the objects which the statutes were intended to secure.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","166":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPENNINGTON v.

Stat.  1262, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 896. To develop the questions to be decided, we chronologically arrange the facts alleged and somewhat abbreviate their statement, omitting nothing, however, relevant to the issues.\n Stating the petitioner to be a brigadier general on the retired list, the petition alleged the period of his military service from 1855, when he entered the Military Academy, up to and including 1899, when, as a brigadier general, he was placed upon the retired list. The arms of the military establishment in which the services of the petitioner were rendered, during the period stated, as well as the various grades through which, by promotion, he passed, were enumerated, the whole period embracing service in the regular Army except a brief time between the 1st of October, 1864, and the 1st day of August, 1865, when it was alleged he served as an officer of the volunteer service. It was charged that:\n'During the entire period of his service as second lieutenant, first lieutenant, and captain aforesaid, the practice of the War Department and of the accounting officers of the Treasury Department was not to count service as a cadet in the United States Military Academy in reckoning the term of five years of service for purposes of the additional ration provided by the act of July 5, 1838, or for longevity increase of pay under  1262 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 896).' \n\n[231 U.S. 631, 633]\n\u00a0\n The following averments were then made:\n\n'It was decided by the Supreme Court of the United States on the 27th day of October, 1884, in the case of United States v. Morton, 112 U. S. p. 3, 28 L. ed. 613, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1, and on the 11th day of March, 1889, in the case of United States v. Watson, 130 U. S. p. 80, 32 L. ed. 852, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 430, that officers of the United States Army were entitled, in computing their rations under said act of July 5, 1838, and in computing their longevity pay under  1262 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 896), to be credited with their service as cadets in the United States Military Academy.\n\n Notwithstanding said decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, the Second Comptroller of the Treasury, on June 20, 1890, decided that he would not allow any claim for additional rations under  15 of the act of July 5, 1838, aforesaid, and for increase of longevity pay under  1262 of the Revised Statutes on account of any service not theretofore admitted as forming a proper subject of credit by the previous practice of the Treasury Department as aforesaid.'\n Although the date when the claim was presented was not stated, it was averred that 'after the decisions of the Supreme Court aforesaid in the Morton and Watson Cases, a claim was presented by this claimant to the Second Auditor of the Treasury for additional rations and longevity pay due under the acts aforesaid in accordance with the decisions of the Supreme Court aforesaid, and said claim was disallowed [on December 13, 1890] by the Second Auditor in accordance with the decision of the Second Comptroller of the Treasury of June 20, 1890, as hereinbefore set forth, and no consideration was given by said Auditor to the interpretation of said statutes made by the Supreme Court in said cases.'\n It was alleged that on the 4th day of March, 1907, 'a provision of law was passed by Congress as a portion \n\n[231 U.S. 631, 634]\n\u00a0\n of the annual sundry civil appropriation bill (34 Stat. at L. 1356, chap. 2918, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 58),' which provision was quoted in full in the petition. It was further alleged:\n'That on the 18th day of May, 1908, the Comptroller of the Treasury decided . . . that in the future the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States in the cases aforesaid would be followed by the accounting officers of the Treasury in claims for additional rations and longevity pay aforesaid, based upon service as a cadet at the Military Academy of West Point, but it was decided by said Comptroller in various cases that . . . the accounting officers of the Treasury would not reopen any claim as aforesaid in which a settlement or adjudication had once been made by their predecessors.'\n\n Following the enactment by Congress of the provision above referred to, it was averred:\n'Your petitioner applied to the Auditor for the War Department in July, 1909, for all arrears of pay then due on account of his service aforesaid, particularly for additional rations and longevity pay on account of his service aforesaid as a cadet in the Military Academy. The Auditor for the War Department refused to consider said claim because of the settlement aforesaid, dated December 13, 1890, by the Second Auditor then in office, disallowing said claim.'\n\n Referring to the provision in the sundry civil appropriation act of 1907, it was then alleged:\n'Your petiuoner respectiully represents that by said provision of statute, there was granted to your petitioner a right to be paid additional rations under said act of 1838, and additional longevity pay under said  1262 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 896), for the reason that the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and of the court of claims of the United States, aforesaid, held that such rations and longevity pay were due in a similar case, and such decisions should have been followed by said \n\n[231 U.S. 631, 635]\n\u00a0\n accounting officers notwithstanding the former settlement or adjudication by one of their predecessors as aforesaid. The refusal of the accounting officers of the Treasury aforesaid to state a balance in favor of your petitioner on account of the former settlement aforesaid deprived your petitioner of a right granted under said act of Congress, for which there is no remedy except by action in this court.'\n\n Plainly, under this pleading the only ground upon which the right to a recovery was based was the provision in the sundry civil appropriation act which was counted upon as conferring a substantive new and independent right. The text of the proviso upon which the case depends is this:\n'Back pay and bounty: For payment of amounts for arrears of pay of two and three year volunteers, for bounty to volunteers and their widows and legal heirs, for bounty under the act of July twenty-eighth, eighteen hundred and sixty-six [14 Stat. at L. 322, chap. 296], and for amounts for commutation of rations to prisoners of war in rebel states, and to soldiers on furlough, that may be certified to be due by the accounting officers of the Treasury during the fiscal year nineteen hundred and eight , $200,000: Provided, That in all cases hereafter so certified the said accounting officers shall, in stating balances, follow the decisions of the United States Supreme Court or of the court of claims of the United States after the time for appeal has expired, if no appeal be taken, without regard to former settlements or adjudications by their predecessors.'\n\n The complaint that the court below held that this provision does not 'include the claim of the appellant' is the single matter assigned as error, and what is urged to be the correct meaning of the provision is thus stated in argument:\n'1. That the above proviso in the act of March 4, 1907, is an acknowledgment of the indebtedness of the United States to all persons whose claims are therein de- \n\n[231 U.S. 631, 636]\n\u00a0\n scribed. and, as a new promise, takes their claims out of the operation of the statute of limitations.\n\n'2. That upon the refusal of the accounting officers to allow a claim as directed by this proviso, an action may be maintained upon the claim in the court of claims because it is a claim 'founded upon . . . any law of Congress' (Judicial Code,  145, 1st [36 Stat. at L. 1136, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1981].'\n\n It is apparent that the construction which the proposition affixes to the proviso does not confine its operation to the character of claims here involved, but extends it so as to embrace all claims of every nature if hereafter it be asserted that a prior administrative determination against the validity of the claim was reached without following the decisions of this court or of the court of claims. The foundation principle contended for by which the result just stated is brought about is that, by the effect of the proviso, a new cause of action is conferred upon the holder of every claim arising against the government from its foundation, however remote may have been the time when an adverse ruling was made, and however otherwise statutes of limitation would be applicable.\n The arguments advanced to sustain the proposition make it clear that such is its scope. For instance, it is insisted that 'Congress has by the proviso enacted that in all cases' 'the administrative rule of res judicata shall not prevail against a judicial decision,' and that the purpose of the provision was to remove the bar of all statutes of limitations as to every case to which the enactment relates. The extreme result of the proposition is thus made apparent. That its assertion is not academic becomes obvious when it is observed that maintaining it is essential to meet the requirements of the case, since without the asserted doctrine of new promise and the contention as to the removal of the bar of statutes of limitation the claim sued on would not be justiciable, and could be barred by limitations. \n\n[231 U.S. 631, 637]\n\u00a0\n Coming to test the proposition by the text of the provision it is seen that it consists simply of an item in a general appropriation act applying a designated sum to pay an enumerated class of cases, of which this is not one, accompanied with a proviso concerning the steps to be taken to ascertain and pay the claims appropriated for. This makes it clear that the sole ground upon which the proposition rests is a disregard of all that portion of the provision which precedes the word 'provided,' thus treating the latter part of the whole clause as distinct and independent legislation.\n In other words, the only avenue of approach for the proposition is through a gateway created by wrenching the provision asunder. We are of opinion that this may not be done. (White v. United States, \n191 U.S. 545\n, 48 L. ed. 295, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 171; Georgia R. & Bkg. Co. v. Smith, \n128 \nU.S. 174, 181\n, 32 S. L. ed. 377, 380, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 47. But it is insisted that the words following the word 'provided' do not technically amount to a proviso, and therefore the clause must be divided into two independent parts, consisting the one of that portion which goes before the word 'provided,' and the other, that portion which follows it. And when this is done the argument is that the word 'all' in the latter portion renders it necessary to give to that portion the far-reaching significance claimed. Conceding for argument's sake that the latter part of the provision, that is, the portion which follows the word 'provided,' may not be technically a proviso, nevertheless the fact that the two provisions are united in enactment is one and the same clause, giving no intrinsic manifestation of a legislative purpose to separate them, causes the concession to be without influence in determining the proper construction of the provision. It is, however, urged that at the time of the enactment of the clause there were pending before Congress various bills concerning the action of the executive departments in failing to apply the rulings of this court \n\n[231 U.S. 631, 638]\n\u00a0\n as to longevity pay, and therefore the provision must have been intended to remedy the evil by the adoption of a general provision accomplishing the results here claimed. The premise, if conceded, serves to refute, instead of to sustain, the proposition based on it, for if it be that the purpose of Congress was to unsettle the entire past administrative action as to all claims against the government, and to confuse the entire administration for the future, it cannot be conceived that such a radical intent would have been expressed in such an obscure and uncertain manner. And this leads us finally to examine the contention that, as in modern practice it has become common to adopt independent legislation on appropriation bills by what is called a 'rider,' therefore the provision here involved should be treated as having that character, and be accordingly independently interpreted as claimed. But whatever be the new habit, it can in no respect serve to relieve the judiciary, when called upon to consider a statute, of the old duty of correctly interpreting it. Indeed, the very suggestion of the practice of 'riders' admonishes that things may not be so associated as one for the purpose of securing the enactment of legislation upon the theory that they are one, and when enacted be disassociated for the purpose of judicial construction so as to cause them to be wholly independent one of the other.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","167":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPEOPLE OF PORTO RICO v.

Brown, Attorney General of Porto Rico, for appellants.\n Mr. Federico Degetau for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was commenced July 23, 1908, in the United States district court for Porto Rico by Pierre Emmannuel, Baron du Laurens d'Oiselay, a citizen of the Republic of France and a resident thereof, against the People of Porto Rico. His complaint alleged that he was the owner of an estate composed of 4,133 cuerdas of land situate in the municipality of Lares, acquired by him as a legacy from the Duchess de Mahon Crillon, who died in France in April, 1899; that, until the year of her death, the Duchess had been paying the taxes and receiving from her colonists a considerable annual income; that on September 4, 1900, the defendant, through the treasurer of Porto Rico, decided that said property belonged to the treasury of Porto Rico, and ordered, among other things, that the Duchess \n\n[235 U.S. 251, 253]\n\u00a0\n be immediately eliminated from the assessment of the property, that the 'terratenientes' (landholders or colonists) be made to appear in the assessments instead of the Duchess, and 'that they proceed to deliver the deeds or titles of concessions that they might possess which gave them the right to the use and fruits of the land to be sent to the treasury;' and that by these means defendant 'wrongfully deprived your plaintiff of his ownership over said property and its rents, the said property having been recorded in the name of the People of Porto Rico, the defendant herein, without having heard your petitioner, or even summoned him to be heard;' that, in view of this action, plaintiff, after having vainly tried to obtain satisfaction from defendant, was obliged to establish the validity of his titles before the courts; that he instituted a suit in the district court of San Juan on January 30, 1901, against the defendant, and that court on August 1, 1902, decided that the lands referred to were the property of plaintiff, and ordered that the inscription made in the registry in the name of the People of Porto Rico be canceled; that the People took an appeal to the supreme court of Porto Rico, and that court affirmed the decisions and confirmed the findings of the district court by its opinion of May 23, 1904 (2 Castro P. R. Dec. 103; 7 P. R. R. 216); that after the question of title was decided, the People of Porto Rico did nothing to put plaintiff in possession of the property, the colonists were not willing to again pay rents to him, and he was obliged to resort to the courts to be put in possession of the lands; that by such litigation he did obtain possession, but that he was entitled to recover from defendant the fruits of which he had been deprived by defendant's action from the time he was unjustly deprived of his ownership until his property was delivered back to him; the period mentioned being from September, 1900, to December, 1905. \n\n[235 U.S. 251, 254]\n\u00a0\n By demurrer and answer the People of Porto Rico interposed a number of defenses, and, among others, that the action was prescribed by virtue of the provisions of  1869 of the Civil Code.\n The cause came on for trial on the merits before the court without a jury, pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, with the result that judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff for $7,450. 5 Porto Rico Fed. Rep. 89. A motion for a new trial was denied (5 Porto Rico Fed. Rep. 362), and defendant appealed to this court.\n In view of appellee's motion to dismiss, we may begin by saying that at the time the appeal was taken the act of April 12, 1900, known as the Foraker act, was in force (31 Stat. at L. 77, 85, chap. 191), by  35 of which it was enacted that 'writs of error and appeals from the final decisions of the supreme court of Porto Rico and the district court of the United States shall be allowed and may be taken to the Supreme Court of the United States in the same manner and under the same regulations and in the same cases as from the supreme courts of the territories of the United States,' etc. Writs of error and appeals from the supreme courts of the territories were regulated by the act of April 7, 1874 (Stat. at L. 27, chap. 80), by the 1st section of which the separate exercise of the common- law and chancery jurisdictions in the territorial courts was dispensed with, and the several codes and rules of practice adopted in the territories respectively, in so far as they authorized a mingling of said jurisdictions or a uniform course of proceeding in all cases, whether legal or equitable, were confirmed; and by the 2d section it was enacted: 'That the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States over the judgments and decrees of said territorial courts in cases of trial by jury shall be exercised by writ of error, and in all other cases by appeal according to such rules and regulations as to form and modes of proceeding as the said Supreme Court have pre- \n\n[235 U.S. 251, 255]\n\u00a0\n scribed or may hereafter prescribe: Provided, that on appeal, instead of the evidence at large, a statement of the facts of the case in the nature of a special verdict, and also the rulings of the court on the admission or rejection of evidence, when excepted to, shall be made and certified by the court below, and transmitted to the Supreme Court, together with the transcript of the proceedings and judgment or decree.'\n Under this system (since superseded by  244 of the Judicial Code of March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. at L. 1087, 1157, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 229), our jurisdiction was, and in the present case is, confined to determining whether the facts found by the supreme court of Porto Rico support its judgment, and whether there was material and prejudicial error in the admission or rejection of evidence manifested by exceptions properly certified. In the absence of a bill of exceptions, questions respecting the admissibility of evidence are, of course, excluded from our consideration, and the review is confined to what appears upon the face of the pleadings and the findings. Rosaly v. Graham y Fraser, \n227 \nU.S. 584, 590\n, 57 S. L. ed. 655, 657, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 353, and cases cited.\n The motion to dismiss is in part based upon the ground that the bill of exceptions herein was not settled and signed until after the expiration of the term in which the new trial was denied, and that certain orders of the court, relied upon by appellant as extending the time for settling the exceptions, have no legal validity. We have examined the grounds upon which this contention rests, and have reached the conclusion that it must be overruled. We spend no further time upon it, since, in the view we take of the merits, the rulings on evidence shown by the bill of exceptions may be disregarded.\n The motion to dismiss is based upon the further ground that the case, being an action at law, should have been brought to this court by writ of error, and not by appeal. But the provisions of the act of 1874, above mentioned, \n\n[235 U.S. 251, 256]\n\u00a0\n render it clear that in legal as well as in equitable actions the proceedings for review must be by appeal, unless there was a trial by jury. The motion to dismiss is therefore denied.\n Coming to the merits, the facts certified are as follows: In the year 1900, shortly after the American occupation of Porto Rico, the then treasurer of the Island, Mr. J. H. Hollander, reached the conclusion that the land in question did not belong to plaintiff, who claimed to have inherited it from the Duchess de Mahon Crillon of France, but was public property, and he therefore, as treasurer, caused the tenants living upon the land to be so notified and the property to be registered in the registry of property as belonging to the People of Porto Rico. Plaintiff protested vigorously against this, but without immediate result. In a short time, however, he produced such evidence of title to Mr. Hollander that the latter wrote him that he had better begin a suit against the People of Porto Rico and have the matter judicially determined. Plaintiff did file such a suit in the district court at San Juan. The attorney general of the island and his assistant appeared and contested the action, but the decision was for the plaintiff. The attorney general, on the part of the People, took an appeal to the supreme court of the island, and that court, in June, 1904, decided in favor of the plaintiff, affirming the decision of the lower court. 2 Castro P. R. Dec. 103; 7 P. R. R. 216. From the time Mr. Hollander registered the property in the name of the People of Porto Rico until plaintiff was again put in possession of the land in the latter part of the year 1905, the tenants refused to pay rent to plaintiff, and the entire sum was lost to him except a few hundred pesos which he managed to collect after much expensive litigation against the tenants. The court found that Mr. Hollander was a special agent of the state for the purpose of the transactions in question, within the meaning of  1804 of the \n\n[235 U.S. 251, 257]\n\u00a0\n Civil Code of 1902; and further, that his action was ratified by the government of Porto Rico by refusing to restore plaintiff's land to him, by requesting and obliging him to bring a suit to establish his rights, and then by defending this suit to final judgment and appealing from that judgment to the supreme court of the island. That the government of the island never actually received any rent, profit, or usufruct from the land or any portion of it; but that it injured plaintiff by depriving him of the right to the use and enjoyment of his property for about five years, in consequence of the deliberate but unauthorized registry of the land in the name of the People of Rorto Rico, and by that action inducing his tenants to thereafter desist and refuse, as they did, from paying him his usual rents. The court found that the insular authorities caused damage to the plaintiff in at least the sum of $7,450, and for this amount judgment was entered, as already mentioned. It will be observed that there is nothing to show that the government of Porto Rico, through its officers or otherwise, was at any time in possession of any part of the lands in question, and there is a distinct finding that the government itself never actually received any rent, profit, or usufruct from the land or any portion of it.\n We have recently decided that the government of Porto Rico is of such nature as to come within the general rule exempting a government, sovereign in its attributes, from being sued without its consent (Porto Rico v. Rosaly y Castillo, \n227 U.S. 270\n, 57 L. ed. 507, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 352). Upon the face of the present record it may be doubtful whether defendant fairly raised in the pleadings the question of its general immunity from action, or whether, on the other hand, its pleadings, construed as a whole, did not rather amount to a consent to litigate the merits. But upon the facts as pleaded and found we think the learned judge of the district court very properly held that if plaintiff can legally recover, it must be by virtue of  1804 of the Civil Code, which is cited also \n\n[235 U.S. 251, 258]\n\u00a0\n as manifesting the government's consent to be sued. The section must be read together with  1803, with which it is inseparably connected. Both are set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[235 U.S. 251, 259]\n\u00a0\n Assuming, however, that the facts certified in the findings, taken by themselves, show a liability on the part of the People of Porto Rico under these sections, still defendant, both by demurrer and by answer, set up prescription by virtue of the provisions of  1869 of the Civil Code. That section, which is one of a series of sections relating to the prescription of actions, reads as follows:\n'Section 1869-The following prescribe in one year:\n\n'1.-Actions to recover or retain possession.\n\n'2.-Actions to demand civil liability for grave insults or calumny, and for obligations arising from the fault or negligence mentioned in  1803, from the time the aggrieved person had knowledge thereof.'\n\n It seems to us clear that an action against the state, based upon the pertinent clause of  1804, is an action to demand civil liability 'for obligations arising from the fault or negligence mentioned in  1803,' within the meaning of  1869. Section 1804 by its very terms imposes upon the principal, with respect to the acts of the representative, not any different obligation, but the same obligation imposed by the preceding section. We say this, notwithstanding the somewhat peculiar form of expression in that part of  1804 which exempts the state from liability when the damage is caused by the official to whom properly it pertained to do the act performed, viz.; the clause, 'in which case the provisions of the preceding section shall be applicable.' This cannot reasonably be interpreted as excluding the liability of the state under  1803 in other cases, but is evidently intended to impose upon the official himself, in respect to damages \n\n[235 U.S. 251, 260]\n\u00a0\n caused in the performance of his ordinary duties, a personal liability under the provisions of  1803, leaving the state liable in the sense of that section when it acts through a special agent. No reason is suggested for limiting the prescription to one year in the case of a default or negligence attributable to defendant personally, and leaving the action unlimited when it is attributable to the fault of defendant's representative or agent.\n Section 1869 being thus found to be applicable to such an action as the present, it only remains to ascertain and compare the pertinent dates. From his complaint herein and from the findings of the trial court it is plain that plaintiff had full knowledge of the wrongful acts of defendant's representative at least as soon as the time of the commencement of his former action against the People of Porto Rico, which was on January 30, 1901, and that the damage resulting from that wrongful conduct, and to recover which his present action is brought, was complete before the end of the year 1905. Evidently the damage was of such a character as to carry notice with it. As already mentioned, the present action was commenced in July, 1908. There is nothing in the record or the findings to explain or excuse this delay or to interrupt the prescription.\n We are not advised of the grounds upon which the court below overruled the plea of prescription. In its opinion it simply said: 'We are also of the belief that, under the circumstances, the court ought not to hold that the claim is barred by the one year statute of limitations, and of course no other is applicable to the facts.' Counsel for appellee has not suggested any ground for avoiding the prescription-indeed, has made no argument upon the subject. We deem it clear that  1869 applies, and that the action is therefore prescribed, and it follows that the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. \n\n[235 U.S. 251, 261]\n\u00a0\n Under the facts of the case it is unnecessary to consider whether the period of prescription began to run when plaintiff first had knowledge of the alleged wrongful acts of Hollander, or only when he had knowledge of the damage consequent thereon. Upon this point, therefore, we express no opinion. Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Section 1803. A person who, by an act or omission, causes damage to another when there is fault or negligence, shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\n'Section 1804.

In Walton's 'Civil Law in Spain,' p. 458, the following version is given: 'The state is liable, in this sense, when it acts through a special agent, but not when the damage has been caused by the official to whom properly it pertains to do the act already done, in which case the provision of the preceding article shall apply.'

RAMOS(1914)\nNo. 390\nArgued: Decided: March 16, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 627, 628]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Felix Frankfurter for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Frank Antonsanti and Frederick S. Tyler for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Action in ejectment for certain described lands in Porto Rico, brought by defendant in error, a citizen of Porto Rico, against Eduardo Wood, a subject of Great Britain.\n Defendant in error alleged in his complaint that he was the owner, possessed and entitled to the possession of the lands, and that Wood, claiming that the property belonged to the estate of Eliza Kortright, of which he was the duly appointed administrator, without right or title entered upon the lands and ejected defendant in error therefrom. Restitution of the lands was prayed and damages in the sum of $5,000.\n The complaint was filed November 12, 1909, and process duly issued thereon. On November 19, 1909, the defendant, Wood, filed a paper entitled, 'Motion to make the People of Porto Rico a Party Defendant, and for an \n\n[232 U.S. 627, 629]\n\u00a0\n Extension of Time to Plead.' It was alleged in the motion that the people of Porto Rico had been declared and adjudged to be the sole heir of Eliza Kortright by an order made by the district court in and for the judicial district of San Juan, she having died intestate and without leaving any legal heirs.\n That the people of Porto Rico, by virtue of such declaration of heirship, have an interest in the result of the suit, and ought to be joined as codefendants.\n That the defendant desired an extension of time to file a demurrer or answer to the complaint, as he might be advised, to the 2d of December, 1909\n\n\n An order was prayed making the people of Porto Rico a party, for service upon them, and that time for pleading be extended.\n Subsequently defendant filed an answer denying each and every material allegation of the complaint, and prayed a dismissal of the action.\n The case, by consent, was subsequently set for trial and a jury empaneled. Thereupon Harvey M. Hutchinson, representing the attorney general of Porto Rico, petitioned the court for a continuance of the trial for time to enable him to ascertain if the people of Porto Rico should be made a party defendant to the cause. In pursuance of the petition the court continued the case. Upon the date to which the cause was continued, Hutchinson again, as representing the attorney general of Porto Rico, appeared in behalf of the people of Porto Rico, and represented to the court that the people of Porto Rico were interested parties to the action. The court thereupon ordered the people of Porto Rico to be made a party. The jury was excused, the cause continued, and the plaintiff (defendant in error) was 'directed to amend his complaint so as to show the people of Porto Rico to be a party defendant.'\n An amended complaint was filed December 15, 1910. \n\n[232 U.S. 627, 630]\n\u00a0\n It alleged the plaintiff to be a citizen of Porto Rico and the defendant 'a body politic created by the Congress of the United States, being a citizen thereof.' That plaintiff was the owner of a 'rustic estate,' describing it, and in possession thereof, and that one Eliza Kortright, since deceased, ejected plaintiff therefrom and continued in possession thereof up to her death. That therefore her estate was placed under judicial administration under the direction of Eduardo Wood, as judicial administrator, which judicial administration ceased during the month of November, 1910, and the administrator discharged. That therefore the defendant, the People of Porto Rico, was adjudged by the district court of San Juan the only heir to the estate of Eliza Kortright, as she left no heirs. That the people of Porto Rico, as such heir, continues to possess the land without right or title thereto, against the will of plaintiff, and to his damage in the sum of $6,000, which sum was prayed as rents and profits, together with restitution of the land.\n Upon motion of the attorney general of Porto Rico, his name was entered as counsel for the people of Porto Rico, and leave granted to file a demurrer.\n The demurrer recited that the attorney general appeared specially for the sole purpose of challenging the jurisdiction of the court in the case, and demurred to the amended complaint for the following reasons: (1) Because the suit was one between plaintiff, a citizen of Porto Rico, and the people of Porto Rico as sole defendant, and that both plaintiff and defendant, being citizens of Porto Rico within the meaning of the act of Congress conferring jurisdiction on the court, the court had no jurisdiction. (2) Because the people of Porto Rico, as a recognized entity, was so far a sovereign as to be exempt from suit at the instance of private individuals.\n The demurrer was overruled and on the 11th of January, 1911, an answer was filed in which defendant in- \n\n[232 U.S. 627, 631]\n\u00a0\n sisted and pleaded that it 'had such attributes of sovereignty' as exempted it from suit. The rest of the answer denied the allegations of the complaint, and set up judgments obtained in two separate suits brought by Eliza Kortright against defendant in error, in which it was adjudged against him that she was the owner of the lands sued for by plaintiff in the present action.\n The action was tried to a jury which found for plaintiff (defendant in error) and assessed damages at $6,000, in accordance with which judgment was entered. A new trial was moved and denied, and this writ of error granted.\n But one contention is argued, that is, that the district court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit against Porto Rico 'without its consent and against its active opposition.' Porto Rico v. Rosaly y Castillo, \n227 U.S. 270\n, 57 L. ed. 507, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 352, is cited to sustain the contention. It was said in that case that the government 'established in Porto Rico is of such a nature as to come within the general rule exempting a government sovereign in its attributes from suit without its consent.' This case, however, is not within the rule. In that case Porto Rico was a defendant in the first instance. In this case it voluntarily petitioned to be made a party, asserting rights to the property in controversy, and, against the opposition of the plaintiff (defendant in error), it was made a party defendant. And this action was not improvident. Its attorney general took time to consider. He applied for and obtained a continance of the case to determine the best course to secure the interests of the people of Porto Rico,-whether to assert its rights in the then litigation, or attempt to keep them under the immunity of its sovereignty from attack. His decision had the support of substantial reasons. The property came to Porto Rico as an escheat, and came therefore as it was held by Eliza Kortright and Wood. If held in wrong by them, it was held in wrong by it, and the attorney general may have considered it well worth \n\n[232 U.S. 627, 632]\n\u00a0\n while to face the controversy rather than remit it to some other proceeding that the plaintiff might institute, fortified, perhaps, by a decision in his favor. United States v. Lee, \n106 U.S. 196\n, 27 L. ed. 171, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240; Stanley v. Schwalby, \n147 U.S. 508\n, 37 L. ed. 259, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 418. But, whatever his reasons, he certainly asked for time, as we have seen, 'to enable him to ascertain if the people of Porto Rico should be made a party defendant' in the cause; and having been granted the time, he appeared again in the cause and represented to the court that Porto Rico was an interested party to the action, and the court, having heard the arguments of opposing counsel, ordered Porto Rico to be made a party, and directed plaintiff to amend his complaint in execution of the order. Porto Rico, therefore, through its attorney general, not only gave its consent to be a party to the cause, but invoked and obtained the ruling of the court against the resistance of the plaintiff to make it a party to the cause.\n The complaint having been amended as moved and directed, and nearly a year having elapsed, there came a change of view; but the immunity of sovereignty from suit without its consent cannot be carried so far as to permit it to reverse the action invoked by it, and to come in and go out of court at its will, the other party having no right of resistance to either step.\n In placing our decision upon the consent of Porto Rico to be made a party defendant under the circumstances presented by this case, we do not wish to imply that Porto Rico could not have been made a party without its consent, the property being an escheat. As to that we express no opinion.\n There is an assignment of error based on the proposition that by the amendment of the complaint the plaintiff and Porto Rico became the sole parties to the action, and they, being citizens of Porto Rico, the court lost jurisdiction of it. The proposition is not urged by plaintiff in error in its brief, and if the proposition did not raise a question of \n\n[232 U.S. 627, 633]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction, we might pass it without comment. It is, however, enough to say of it that the original defendant, Wood, was properly sued, he then being a subject of Great Britain, and in possession of the land. Porto Rico, subsequently becoming a party, did not oust the jurisdiction. Phelps v. Oaks, \n117 U.S. 236\n, 29 L. ed. 888, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 714; Hardebergh v.

Stat. 1901, p. 1567], Congress passed an act for the sale of lands of the United States in the territory northwest of the Ohio river and above the mouth of the Kentucky river, by  9 of which act it was provided that all navigable rivers within the territory to be disposed of by virtue of the act should be deemed to be and remain public highways. Subsequently there was separated from such territory by an act of Congress, dated May 7, 1800 [ 2 Stat. at L. 58, chap. 41], the portion thereof which now embraces the states of Illinois and Louisiana, to be called Indiana territory. On March 26, 1804 [2 Stat. at L. 277, chap. 35], Congress, acting under the Constitution of 1787, passed an act for the disposal of the public lands in Indiana territory, by which it was provided that all the navigable rivers, creeks, and waters within that territory should be deemed to be and remain public highways.\n By an act of February 3, 1809 [2 Stat. at L. 514, chap. 13], Congress divided the Indiana territory and constituted that portion of it which now comprises the state of Illinois a separate territory, to be called Illinois, and provided that its inhabitants should be entitled to and enjoy all and singular the rights, privileges, and advantages \n\n[234 U.S. 497, 512]\n\u00a0\n granted and secured to the people of the Northwest territory by the ordinance of July 13, 1787\n\n\n On the 18th of April, 1818 [3 Stat. at L. 428, chap. 67], Congress passed an act to enable the people of Illinois to form a constitution and state government for admission into the Union upon an equality with other states, and provided that the government should be republican, and not repugnant to the ordinance of July 13, 1787. A constitution was adopted, and Congress, on the 3d of December, 1818 [3 Stat. at L. 536], declared the admission of the state into the Union, that its constitution and government was republican and in conformity to the provisions of the articles of compact between the original states and the people and the states in the territory northwest of the River Ohio, passed on July 13, 1787.\n The river Des Plaines is situated in the Northwest territory, rises in Wisconsin, and flows southerly into the state of Illinois (its course is given), in all a distance of about 96 miles.\n The river Kankakee rises in Indiana and flows westerly into Illinois and unites in Grundy county with the Des Plaines, forming with it the Illinois, which flows thence westerly and southwesterly through several counties in Illinois into the Mississippi river. Wherefore, by reason of the fact that the Des Plaines river is wholly within the Northwest territory, and that it empties its waters into the Mississippi, and by reason of the other facts set forth, it is subject to the provisions of the acts of Congress set out.\n It is shown by early explorations and discoveries that the Des Plaines river was navigable from a point near where is now situated the city of Chicago to its mouth, and was used as a highway for commercial purposes, and commerce was carried on over it and over the Chicago river, located in Cook county, Illinois, and connection therewith made by a short portage between the two \n\n[234 U.S. 497, 513]\n\u00a0\n rivers near the site of what is now the city of Chicago and was in use as a highway of commerce leading from Lake Michigan and the waters emptying into the St. Lawrence river, on the one hand, and the waters of the Mississippi river, on the other, thenceforward from the time of said first use up to and at the time when the ordinance of 1787 and the several acts of Congress were respectively enacted.\n Afterward the state of Illinois, by and through its legislature, and in obedience to the several acts of Congress set forth, assumed charge of the river, and in 1839 gave permission for the building of a toll bridge across the river, and subsequently, by an act passed in 1839, amending the several laws in relation to the Illinois and Michigan canal, it was provided that no stream of water passing through the canal lands should pass by the sale so as to deprive the state of the use of such water if necessary to supply the canal without charge for the same; and it was further provided that the lands situated upon the streams which have been meandered by the surveys of public lands by the United States should be considered as bounded by the lines of those surveys, and not by the streams. In the same year an act was passed declaring the river a navigable stream, and providing that it should be deemed and held a public highway, and should be free, open, and unobstructed from its point of connection with the canal to its utmost limit within the state for the passage of all boats and water craft of every description.\n In 1845 the state authorized the construction and continuance of the milldam across the river with reservation of the right to the state of improving the dam and of using the water for the canal, and for any other purpose; and in 1849, authorized the building of a bridge at Lockport. The state, by certain acts of its legislature (they are set out), created the Sanitary District of Chicago, under the provision of which a channel was constructed connecting Lake Michigan with the Des Plaines river, at a point \n\n[234 U.S. 497, 514]\n\u00a0\n some 16 miles above the site of the dam in question, and through which about 300,000 cubic feet of water per minute are drawn through the Chicago river and the Sanitary District drainage channel, and discharged in the Des Plaines river.\n It was provided that the channel when completed should be a navigable stream, and that when the general government should improve the river, it should have full control over the same for navigation purposes, but not to interfere with its control for sanitary drainage purposes.\n On the 6th of December, 1907, the legislature passed an act, which is as follows:\n'Sec. 1. Be it enacted by the people of the state of Illinois, represented in the general assembly: That the Des Plaines and Illinois rivers throughout their courses from below the water power plant of the main channel of the Sanitary District of Chicago in the township of Lockport, at or near Lockport, in the county of Will, are hereby recognized as and are hereby declared to be navigable streams, and it is made the special duty of the governor and the attorney general to prevent the erection of any structures in or across said streams without explicit authority from the general assembly, and the governor and attorney general are hereby authorized and directed to take the necessary legal action or actions to remove all and every obstruction now existing in said rivers that in anywise interferes with the intent and purpose of this act.'1\n\n The relator, Charles S. Deneen, is the governor referred to in the act, and that, by virtue of the statute, his office and constitutional duty, he has a special interest and responsibility in the matters set forth.\n The purchasers from the state in  25 and other similarly situated lands with reference to the Des Plaines river did not take and did not claim to take under their several purchases that portion of the lands lying between \n\n[234 U.S. 497, 515]\n\u00a0\n the meander line and the water of the river, and that the lands so lying have never been used by any individual under any claim of authority or right vested in the purchasers from the state of Illinois, save and except as claimed by defendant. Lands so lying, therefore, together with the bed of the stream of the river in said quarter section, and other lands similarly situated with reference to the river, have not passed by any purchase of adjoining lands from the state of Illinois, but the same and every part thereof is owned by the state, and held for the benefit of its people and of the people of the United States as a public highway for commerce.\n The trustees of the Illinois and Michigan canal executed and delivered to one Charles E. Boyer a deed bearing date October 22, 1860, to land in  25, excepting and reserving so much as was occupied by the canal and its waters, and a strip 90 feet wide on either side of the canal, containing 196 62-100 acres, the tract being a portion of the land granted by the United States to the state to aid the state in opening a canal to connect the waters of the Illinois river with those of Lake Michigan, and by the state granted to the board of trustees of the canal for the purposes set forth in the act of February 21, 1843.\n The defendant derives its title by mesne conveyances from Boyer and certain contracts and leases entered into between the canal commissioners and one Harold F. Griswold and assigned to defendant, and, in pursuance of the claim of right thus obtained, defendant commenced the construction of a dam across the river, but that the said several leases, deeds, and contracts are ineffectual to confer any right to build or maintain the dam.\n The legislature of the state, by a proper resolution passed on the 16th of October, 1907, has proposed the building of a deep waterway commencing at the southern end of the Chicago drainage canal and extending along the Des Plaines river, to be submitted to a vote of the people \n\n[234 U.S. 497, 516]\n\u00a0\n of the state, and, if the same is built, as incident thereto locks and dams will necessarily be constructed across the deep waterway at or near the S. E. 1\/4 of section 25, which dams will incidentally afford water power of the value of several millions of dollars to the state, which will be lost to the state if the defendant be permitted to construct the dam in question.\n The 90-foot strip along the line of the Illinois and Michigan canal constitutes an integral part of the canal, and the trustees of the canal and the canal commissioners of the state had no right or authority under the law to convey the same by deed, lease, or otherwise. Wherefore the defendant acquired no right to such strip, and said deeds, leases, contracts, and other agreements are void so far as they pertain to the bed of the stream of the river, and to the lands lying outside the meander line.\n By virtue of the several acts of Congress set forth, the state is the owner of such lands and other lands similarly situated. The defendant, claiming to own such lands and other lands in section 25, has actually begun the erection of the dam referred to; the attorney general, therefore, on the 12th of December, 1907, served notice upon the defendant to desist from the erection of the dam and from further trespassing upon the lands owned by the state, and to remove any and all obstructions placed thereon. Defendant has ignored the notice, and, unless prevented by injunction, will complete the dam, to the great impairment of navigation, and to the great and irreparable damage to the people of the state.\n There are other allegations in regard to the leases and contracts from the canal commissioners which are not necessary to be given.\n The prayer of the information was for an injunction in accordance with the allegations.\n Defendant in error summarizes its answer as follows: It denied that the Des Plaines river was or ever had been \n\n[234 U.S. 497, 517]\n\u00a0\n navigable, and alleged that it never had been navigated for the purpose of commerce; and also that it had, from the earliest times, been completely obstructed by various bridges and dams built without legislative authority, and that the state itself had constructed and for many years maintained, and still maintains, a dam entirely across the river at Joliet. It set out correspondence with the War Department of the United States before the construction of the dam was begun, from which it appeared that the plans of the proposed structure were submitted to that Department for the purpose of ascertaining whether the project would be in harmony with the work of the improvement of the river proposed-but never decided upon-by the government, and that the officers of the Department stated not only that it would be so in harmony, but, if carried out, it would save the government large sums of money. The correspondence also stated that the river had never yet been considered a navigable stream of the United States, and that it was not subject to the provision of  9-13 of the act of March 3, 1899 [30 Stat. at L. 1151, 1152, chap. 425, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 3540-3542], or to other similar United States legislation.\n The answer further alleged that subsequently defendant in error acquired the property, and that a large sum of money had been expended and heavy obligations incurred by it in carrying out the project of building the dam.\n Upon the issues thus made, evidence was taken, which composes three large volumes, upon which the courts below decided against plaintiffs in error; and we are to consider whether, in so doing, any Federal right was passed upon or denied it.\n To sustain the contention that such right was passed upon and denied, it is said 'that at the time the information in equity was filed, and for over six years before the defendant in error became a riparian owner, the Des Plaines river, irrespective of the question of its naviga- \n\n[234 U.S. 497, 518]\n\u00a0\n bility, was a navigable river of the United States at the point where the dam was erected,' and this because of the 'concurrent action of the state and Federal governments by the construction of the Chicago Sanitary ship canal, the connection of it with the Chicago river and Lake Michigan on the northeast, and the discharge of the water into Lake Michigan from it into Des Plaines and Illinois on the southwest.'\n It is further contended that the state court did not decide this question adversely to plaintiffs in error, but, on the contrary, excluded the admitted fact as being immaterial because that condition was artificially created. And this because defendant in error urged in that court that the navigability of the river could not be determined by its capacity as improved by the addition of the water of the Sanitary District. The court, in its decision, therefore, it is the final contention, denied the rights arising from the condition of navigability thus created by state and Federal action, and plaintiffs in error insist that 'if artificial navigability can create a public right which is entitled to protection against the acts of one who purchases riparian property after that condition was created, then, on the conceded law, the judgment of the state court was erroneous. And if those public rights are created or protected by Federal law, this court has jurisdiction to reverse the judgment.'\n The inquiry immediately occurs, How did the so-called public right arise? From the mere addition of water to the river or by the conditions upon which it was admitted? The bill alleges the enactment of many laws and a complex system of improvements by virtue of them, rights asserted by the state to the lands bordering on the river, and rights to the bed of the river, conveyances, leases, and contracts by public officers constituted by laws which verbally, at least, confer authority upon them, and rights asserted by defendant in error arising from the execution \n\n[234 U.S. 497, 519]\n\u00a0\n of such authority. But all of the questions hence arising are state questions, whether depending upon law or fact, which it is not in our province to review. It would seem, therefore, at the outset, that one of the elements of the Federal right asserted is absent. However, let us see what the supreme court of the state has decided.\n Mr. Justice Vickers, delivering the opinion of the court, says: 'Appellant [the state] bases its claim to relief on three propositions-as follows: (1) That the state of Illinois owns the bed of the river at the point where it is proposed to build said dam; (2) that the Des Plaines river is a navigable stream, and that the proposed dam would constitute an obstruction to navigation; (3) that certain contracts executed by the commissioners of the Illinois and Michigan canal, under which appellee [ defendant in error] claims certain rights in connection with the construction of said dam, are void, and that no rights were acquired by or can be asserted under said contracts.' [241 Ill. 309, 89 N. E. 760.]\n The first and third propositions manifestly involve state questions and were decided adversely to plaintiffs in error. They might be put out of discussion except so far as they may have bearing on the second proposition. By the second proposition the navigability of the river is presented as a question of fact, and of it the court said that it had received the most exhaustive treatment by counsel, and that if the dismissal of the bill by the court below had been without prejudice to renew the application for injunction, the action of the court could be sustained because of the utter failure of the plaintiffs in error to prove that the construction of the proposed dam would be an obstruction to the then navigation of the river. 'There is no proof,' the court said, 'that the river is now being used as a public highway for commerce. On the contrary, the evidence not only shows that the river is not being so used, but it shows affirmatively that, \n\n[234 U.S. 497, 520]\n\u00a0\n owing to the presence of numerous other dams and some fifty or more bridges which span the river, it would be impossible, under existing conditions, to navigate the stream. There being at present no navigation whatever upon the river, obviously the dam in question cannot be said to be an obstruction to navigation that has no existence in fact.' The trial court not making the indicated reservation, but having rendered a decree based on the finding that the river was not navigable, thus settling the question for all time, the supreme court considered the question as presented on the merits. After a review of the evidence and the contentions of the parties, it decided that the river was not navigable in a state of nature, and declared that there was not in the entire record a well authenticated instance in which a boat engaged in commerce navigated the waters of the Des Plaines river. Referring to the testimony, the court said: 'Whatever may be thought of the preponderance of it one way or the other, it can have but little weight as against the uncontroverted fact that the river has never been used as a public highway for commerce.' And again, 'After the most careful consideration of this question we are of the opinion that the Des Plaines river in its natural condition is not a navigable stream, and that the rights of parties to this suit must be determined upon that basis.' The court besides rejected the contention that the Sanitary District act declared the river to be navigable. The contention, it was said, was 'based on a sentence in  24 of said act, as follows: 'When such channel shall be completed, and the water turned therein, to the amount of 300,000 cubic feet of water per minute, the same is hereby declared a navigable stream.' Appellant's [the state] contention, under this statute, is thus stated in its brief: 'The same means that the water flowing in that channel is a navigable stream. The water so turned in was navigable in fact, and it does not lose its naviga- \n\n[234 U.S. 497, 521]\n\u00a0\n bility in passing out of the artificial channel into the channel of the Des Plaines river. The water is just as navigable one-half mile southwest of Joliet as it is one-half mile northeast of Joliet.' The argument is based upon an erroneous construction of the word 'same.' That term refers to the channel of the Sanitary District, and has on reference to the water after it leaves the channel.'\n The court, however, said that even if the legislature had declared in unequivocal language that the river was navigable, as it did by the act of 1907 [the act under which the information was filed], the declaration could not affect the rights of defendant in error, they being protected by the Constitution of the state, which forbids private property from being taken for public use without just compensation previously made, for which the court cited a number of cases and Cooley on Constitutional Limitations , *591. And it was added that none of the legislative acts had the primary purpose of permitting a deep-water channel from the Lakes to the Gulf by means of improving the channel of the Des Plaines river, nor did the various acts passed in the interest of the Illinois and Michigan canal nor the Sanitary District act include a general scheme for the improvement of that river. 'Up to this time,' it was further said, 'no general plan for the deep waterway has been adopted by the state or nation,' and whether any such enterprise will ever be adopted, and whether it will include the Des Plaines river, 'are all legislative questions with which the courts have no concern.' If it be done, the court continued, it must be done 'with due regard to the rights of every citizen, however humble and insignificant those rights may seem in contrast with the great public consummation.'\n We have already seen that the contention of the plaintiff in error that the bed of the river was in the state, and \n\n[234 U.S. 497, 522]\n\u00a0\n not in the riparian owners, among whom is defendant in error, by force of the act of the legislature of the state of February 26, 1839, in relation to the Illinois and Michigan canal, was held untenable, and it was further held that the contracts of the canal commissioners under which defendant in error claims rights were valid. And the court further decided that the legislation of the state did not intend nor contemplate the improvement of the Des Plaines river from a condition of non-navigability to navigability, and no act, except that of 1907, had declared it to be navigable, and that no act could do so and affect private rights under the Constitution of the state. The supreme tribunal of the state has therefore decided that plaintiffs in error have no elements of right against defendant in error.\n It is said, however, as a foundation of a right under the acts of Congress alleged, that the river, although it was not navigable in its natural state, became so by the addition of water from the Sanitary District. This contention was rejected by the supreme court, the court deciding, as we have seen, that the navigability of the river was to be determined by its natural condition, and not by its condition created by artificial means. In resistance to this conclusion of the court, and in assertion of a Federal right, plaintiffs in error cite, besides the acts of Congress referred to in the information, certain acts of Congress passed in 1899, 1900 [31 Stat. at L. 580, chap. 790], and 1902 [32 Stat. at L. 364, chap. 1079], appropriating money for 'a survey and estimates of cost for the improvement of the upper Illinois and lower Des Plaines rivers in Illinois, with a view to the extension of navigation from the Illinois river to Lake Michigan,' and adduce, besides, other recognitions by Congress of the navigability of the river, and contend that therefore, the rights of the state are based on Federal laws, and 'that in its sovereign right, and as parens patrios and of its citizens, and on behalf of the citizens of all of the United States [italics counsel's], it had \n\n[234 U.S. 497, 523]\n\u00a0\n the right under those Federal laws to prevent the accomplishment by defendant of an act destructive of the navigability of the stream.'\n Plaintiffs in error state their contention another way. They say the acts of the two sovereignties, state and national, in furtherance therance of a common object, are so interwoven and related that the rights and questions arising from them, and the construction of their effect, necessarily create Federal questions.\n But we have seen that the supreme court of the state decided there was no concurrence of the state in furtherance of the so-called common object; that is, that the various acts in regard to the Illinois and Michigan canal or the Sanitary District did not include any general scheme for the improvement of the Des Plaines river, and it was certainly within the competency of the court to so determine. The court was also of the view that, under the Constitution of the state, the state did not have the 'sovereign right, and as parens patrioe,' to restrain the acts of defendant in error.\n The court seemed to consider that it had decided all of the contentions of the state when it had decided the question of the navigability of the river both in its natural condition and its condition after the addition of the waters of the Sanitary District. The fact was and is pivotal. The ordinance for the government of the Northwest territory and the subsequent acts of Congress set out in the information do not determine navigability of the streams, but only define rights which depend upon its existence. Passing the question, therefore, whether the ordinance or the acts refer to physical obstructions or to political regulations, and also passing the question whether they were of force after the admission of the state into the Union (on both questions see Willameete Iron Bridge Co. v. Hatch, \n125 U.S. 1\n, 31 L. ed. 629, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 811), the fact of navigability having been decided against the state by the state court, there is no Federal \n\n[234 U.S. 497, 524]\n\u00a0\n right left to review. Crary v. Devlin, \n154 U.S. 619\n, and 23 L. ed. 510, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1199; Cameron v. United States, \n146 U.S. 533\n, 36 L. ed. 1077, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 184; Egan v. Hart, \n165 U.S. 188\n, 41 L. ed. 680, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 300. In the latter case it was decided that the question of navigability is purely one of fact.\n It is said, however, that by the acts of 1899, 1900, and 1902, Congress has taken jurisdiction of the Des Plaines river. If so, the state is not the instrument through which the jurisdiction can be exercised. United States v. Bellingham Bay Boom Co. \n176 U.S. 211\n, 44 L. ed. 437, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 343; Willamette Iron Bridge Co. v. Hatch, supra; Cleveland v. Cleveland Electric R. Co. \n201 U.S. 529\n, 50 L. ed. 854, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 513.\n But the cited acts are not appropriations for improvements undertaken, but for improvements which may be undertaken; not a jurisdiction exercised, but a jurisdiction to be exercised. And, as we have seen, it is alleged in the answer, and the allegation is sustained by the evidence, that the plans of defendant in error's structure were submitted to the War Department, and it was declared by that Department, 'The work proposed is in general harmony with the work of improvement recommended by the board of engineers appointed under the authority of the rivers and harbors act of June 13, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 331, 334, chap. 1079).' But the Department, inasmuch as Congress had not authorized the improvement of the river, did 'not deem it expedient to take further and definite action in the matter of approving the plans.' It is manifest, therefore, that the state has no right under Federal laws which it may assert for itself or 'on behalf of the citizens of all of the United States,' and the motion to dismiss must be granted.\n Dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Expiration of term of office of Charles S.

This reservation was created by the treaty of April 19, 1858 ( 11 Stat. at L. 743), for the use of the Yankton tribe of Sioux Indians, and originally embraced 400,000 acres. A considerable part of it was allotted in severalty to the members of the tribe under the act of February 8, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 388, chap. 119), and the amendatory act of February 28, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 794, chap. 383), the allotments being in small tracts scattered throughout the reservation. By an agreement ratified and confirmed by Congress August 15, 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 286, 314, chap. 290), the tribe ceded and relinquished to the United States all the unallotted lands. In the 17th article of the agreement it was stipulated: 'No intoxicating liquors nor other intoxicants shall ever be sold or given away upon any of the lands by this agreement ceded and sold to the United States, nor upon any other lands within or comprising the reservations of the Yankton Sioux or Dakota Indians, as described in the treaty between the said Indians and the United States, dated April 19th, 1858, and as afterwards surveyed and set off to the said Indians. The penalty for the violation of this provision shall be such as Congress may prescribe in the act ratifying this agreement.' And in the ratifying act it was provided: 'That every person who shall sell or give away any intoxicating liquors or other intoxicants upon any of the lands by said agreement ceded, or upon any of the lands included in the Yankton Sioux Indian Reservation as created by the treaty of April nineteenth, eighteen hundred and fifty-eight, shall be punishable by imprisonment for not more than two \n\n[232 U.S. 478, 481]\n\u00a0\n years and by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars.' [p. 319.]\n Conformably to  5 of the act of 1887, each allottee was given a trust certificate declaring that the United States would hold the land embraced in his allotment, for the period of twenty-five years, or such extended period as the President might direct, in trust for him, or, in case of his decease, for his heirs, but without power in him or them to convey or make any contract touching the land during the trust period, and at the expiration of that period would issue to him or them a patent conveying the title in fee, discharged of the trust. Some of the allotted lands were subsequently disposed of pursuant to express authority from Congress, and those remaining approach 100,000 acres, occupied by more than 1,500 Indians. Rep. Com. Ind. Affairs, 1911, p. 72. The trust period has not expired, nor has the tribal relation of the Indians been dissolved. An agent or superintendent remains in charge of their affairs and they are still wards of the government. Hallowell v. United States, \n221 U.S. 317\n, 55 L. ed. 750, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 587; United States v. Sandoval, \n231 U.S. 28\n, 58 L. ED. --, 34 SUP. CT. rep. 1.\n The ceded lands, excepting some small tracts retained by the government as sites for an Indian agency, Indian schools, and the like, were opened to disposition under the homestead and townsite laws, May 21, 1895 (29 Stat. at L. 865), and have largely passed into private ownership.\n The place at which the intoxicating liquors were sold was within the defendant's own prcmises in the town of Dante, an organized municipality located upon a part of the ceded lands then held in private ownership by the inhabitants, none of whom was an Indian. The defendant is a white man, but whether the persons to whom the liquors were sold were white or Indian does not appear, and is immaterial under the statutory provision before quoted, upon which the prosecution was founded.\n The objections urged in the district court against the \n\n[232 U.S. 478, 482]\n\u00a0\n conviction, and now renewed, call in question the validity of that statutory provision, and are, first, that the power to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors upon all ceded lands rests exclusively in the state; and, second, that if Congress possesses any such power, it necessarily is limited to what is reasonably essential to the protection of the Indians occupying the unceded lands, and that this limitation is transcended by the provision in question because it embraces territory greatly in excess of what the situation reasonably requires, and because its operation is not confined to a designated period, reasonable in duration, but apparently is intended to be perpetual.\n The power of Congress to prohibit the introduction of intoxicating liquors into an Indian reservation, wheresoever situate, and to prohibit traffic in such liquors with tribal Indians, whether upon or off a reservation and whether within or without the limits of a state, does not admit of any doubt. It arises in part from the clause in the Constitution investing Congress with authority 'to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes,' and in part from the recognized relation of tribal Indians to the Federal government.

United States, supra; Ex parte Webb, \n225 \nU.S. 663, 683\n, 691 S., 56 L. ed. 1248, 1256, 1259, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 769; United States v. Wright, \n229 U.S. 226\n, 57 L. ed. 1160, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 630; United States v. Sandoval, supra. 'These Indian tribes are the wards of the Nation. They are communities dependent on the United States. . . . From their very weakness and helplessness, so largely due to the course of dealing of the Federal government with them and the treaties in which it has been promised, there arises the duty of protection, and with it the power. This has always been recognized by the Executive and by Congress, and by this court, whenever the question has arisen.' United States v. Kagama, \n118 \nU.S. 375, 383\n, 30 S. L. ed. 228, 231, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1109. \n\n[232 U.S. 478, 483]\n\u00a0\n Whether this power to protect the government's Indian wards against the evils of intemperance, of which they are easy victims, is sufficiently comprehensive to enable Congress, when securing the cession of part of an Indian reservation within a state, to prohibit the sale of intoxicants upon the ceded lands, if, in its judgment, that is reasonably essential to the protection of the Indians residing upon the unceded lands, is the real question presented by the first of the defendant's objections. We say it is the real question, because if Congress possesses power to do this it follows that the state possesses no exclusive control over the subject, and that the congressional prohibition is supreme. United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 419, 18 L. ed. 186.\n The stipulation before quoted shows that when the Indians and the commissioners representing the United States agreed upon a cession of the unallotted lands, among which the allotted tracts were interspersed, both were of opinion that due regard for the welfare of the Indians required that traffic in intoxicants upon the ceded lands be interdicted, as it was before the cession; and Congress, evidently being of a like opinion, inserted in the ratifying act the provision making it a punishable offense for any person to sell or give away any intoxicating liquors or other intoxicants upon any of the ceded lands. Stipulations and provisions of this character are not new, but have occasionally appeared in Indian treaties and legislation for more than fifty years. The case of United States v. 43 Gallons of Whiskey (United States v. Lariviere), \n93 U.S. 188\n, 23 L. ed. 846, arose out of a treaty with the Chippewas in 1863 (13 Stat. at L. 668), wherein a considerable portion of a reservation in the state of Minnesota was ceded to the United States. The treaty contained a stipulation that the laws of the United States, then in force or thereafter enacted, prohibiting the introduction and sale of spirituous liquors in the Indian country, should be operative throughout the ceded lands \n\n[232 U.S. 478, 484]\n\u00a0\n until Congress or the President should direct otherwise; and the principal question in the case was whether this stipulation encroached upon the power of the state and upon its equal footing with the original states. This court puheld the stipulation, and in the course of the opinion, after observing that the power of Congress to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes is 'as broad and as free from restrictions as that to regulate commerce with foreign nations,' said (p. 195): 'As long as these Indians remain a distinct people, with an existing tribal organization, recognized by the political department of the government, Congress has the power to say with whom, and on what terms, they shall deal, and what articles shall be contraband. If liquor is injurious to them inside of a reservation, it is equally so outside of it; and why cannot Congress forbid its introduction into a place near by, which they would be likely to frequent? It is easy to see that the love of liquor would tempt them to stray beyond their borders to obtain it; and that bad white men, knowing this, would carry on the traffic in adjoining localities, rather than venture upon forbidden ground.' And again (p. 197): 'The chiefs doubtless saw, from the curtailment of their reservation, and the consequent restriction of the limits of the 'Indian country,' that the ceded lands would be used to store liquors for sale to the young men of the tribe; and they well knew that, if there was no cession, they were already sufficiently protected by the extent of their reservation. Under such circumstances, it was natural that they should be unwilling to sell until assured that the commercial regulation respecting the introduction of spirituous liquors should remain in force in the ceded country, until otherwise directed by Congress or the President. This stipulation was not only reasonable in itself, but was justly due from a strong government to a weak people it had engaged to protect. . . . Based as it is exclusively on the Federal \n\n[232 U.S. 478, 485]\n\u00a0\n authority over the subject-matter, there is no disturbance of the principle of state equality.' The case came here a second time and the views before expressed were reaffirmed. \n108 U.S. 491\n, 27 L. ed. 803, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 906.\n The case of Dick v. United States, \n208 U.S. 340\n, 52 L. ed. 520, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 399, is even more in point. There the Nez Perc e tribe, by an agreement ratified by Congress, had ceded to the United States a large portion of their reservation in the state of Idaho, and in the agreement was a stipulation subjecting the ceded lands, for a period of twenty-five years, to the Federal laws prohibiting the introduction of intoxicants into the Indian country. The major part of the unceded lands was allotted in severalty to members of the tribe under the acts of 1887 and 1891, supra, and the ceded lands were opened to disposition under the public- land laws. In regular course, some of the ceded lands were patented to white men and came to be the site of a town. Under the stipulation, Dick was prosecuted for introducing intoxicating liquors into the town, and was convicted; whereupon he brought the judgment here for review, his chief contention being that, in view of Idaho's position as a state, Congress was without constitutional power to authorize or ratify the stipulation. Upon full consideration this court affirmed the judgment, and, following United States v. 43 Gallons of Whiskey, supra, and other cases, held that the stipulation was a valid regulation, and not subject to objection on constitutional grounds. See also Bates v. Clark, \n95 \nU.S. 204, 208\n, 24 S. L. ed. 471, 472; Clairmont v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 551, 558\n, 56 S. L. ed. 1201, 1204, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 787.\n We could not sustain the defendant's first objection without departing from the principles announced and applied in those cases, and this we have no disposition to do, for we regard them as embodying a right conception of the power of Congress in dealing with the Indian wards and adopting measures for their protection.\n We come, then, to the objection that the prohibition in \n\n[232 U.S. 478, 486]\n\u00a0\n the act of 1894 covers an unnecessarily extensive territory, and is not limited in duration, and so transcends the power of Congress.\n As the power is incident only to the presence of the Indians and their status as wards of the government, it must be conceded that it does not go beyond what is reasonably essential to their protection, and that, to be effective, its exercise must not be purely arbitrary, but founded upon some reasonable basis. Thus, a prohibition like that now before us, if covering an entire state when there were only a few Indian wards in a single county, undoubtedly would be condemned as arbitrary. And a prohibition valid in the beginning doubtless would become inoperative when, in regular course, the Indians affected were completely emancipated from Federal guardianship and control. A different view in either case would involve an unjustifiable encroachment upon a power obviously residing in the state. On the other hand, it must also be conceded that, in determining what is reasonably essential to the protection of the Indians, Congress is invested with a wide discretion, and its action, unless purely arbitrary, must be accepted and given full effect by the courts.\n The claim that the territory covered by this prohibition is so excessive as to make it purely arbitrary is devoid of merit. The original reservation embraced 400,000 acres,-a district practically 25 miles square. The allotments are in small tracts scattered throughout this district, and aggregate nearly 100,000 acres. The number of Indians affected is upwards of 1,500, and they are more or less in a state of transition from an unsettled to a settled life. In this situation, and having some regard to the weakness of Indians in respect of the use of intoxicants, we are far from believing that Congress exceeded the limits of its discretion in applying the prohibition to all the ceded lands. \n\n[232 U.S. 478, 487]\n\u00a0\n Of the claim that the prohibition is not expressly limited in its duration it is enough to observe that this objection cannot be of present avail. The conditions justifying the prohibition remain substantially the same as when it was adopted. The trust period has not expired, the tribal relation has not been dissolved, and the wardship of the Indians has not been terminated. See Marchie Tiger v. Western Invest. Co. \n221 \nU.S. 286, 315\n, 55 S. L. ed. 738, 749, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 578; act May 8, 1906, 34 Stat. at L. 182, chap. 2348; United States v. Pelican (decided this day [\n232 U.S. 442\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 396]). The fact that the conditions may become so changed in the future as to render the prohibition inoperative affords no reason for condemning it now. Unless sooner repealed, it will continue in force as long as the presence and status of the Indians sustain it as a Federal regulation.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","171":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPIERCE v.

The firm credited the estate at cost, $ 20,584.67, but the courts below found that it was worth $80,000, charged the difference, $59,415.33, as profit, and credited the appellee with $5, 941.53. They likewise found that the profit on the crops was much greater than the appellee's estimate, and therefore allowed him the $2,000 claimed in his complaint.\n It may be that we should adopt a different rule from that followed by the courts below if the question came here as a pure question of law.

A copy of such duplicate surveys, certified to, must be filed with the owners of the adjoining properties and with the inspector of the district in which the mine or property is situated.'\n\n Art. 18, under the head of 'Definition of Terms,' contains, inter alia, the following:\n The term 'owners' and 'operators' means any person or body corporate who is the immediate proprietor or lessee or occupier of any coal mine or colliery or any part thereof. The term 'owner' does not include a person or body corporate who merely receives a royalty, rent, or fine from a coal mine or colliery or part thereof, or is merely the proprietor of the mine, subject to any lease, grant, or license for the working or operating thereof, or is merely the owner of the soil, and not interested in the minerals of the mine or any part thereof. But any 'contractor' for the working of a mine or colliery, or any part or district thereof, shall be subject to this act as an operator or owner, in like manner as if he were the owner.'\n The record shows that the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Company and the Plymouth Coal Company are respectively the lessees or owners of adjoining coal properties \n\n[232 U.S. 531, 534]\n\u00a0\n situate at Plymouth, in Luzerne county, Pennsylvania; that on August 31, 1909, Mr. Davis, the inspector of mines of the district in which the properties are located, wrote a letter to the president of the Plymouth Coal Company which reads as follows:\n Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Aug. 31, '09.

There was a prayer for a preliminary and perpetual injunction to restrain defendant from working its mine without leaving a barrier pillar of coal of the thickness or width of at least 30 feet in each seam or vein worked by it along the line of the adjoining property. Defendant answered, admitting the truth of the averments of the bill without qualification, except that it denied that any barrier was necessary for the safety of the employees of either mine in case \n\n[232 U.S. 531, 536]\n\u00a0\n the other mine should be abandoned. At the same time it averred that the act of June 2, 1891, upon which the bill was based, 'is confiscatory, unconstitutional, and void.' There was a preliminary injunction, restraining defendant from working its mine without leaving a barrier pillar at least 70 feet wide. This was continued until the final hearing, which resulted in a decree continuing the injunction, but without prejudice to defendant's 'to apply to the court for a dissolution or modification thereof, upon showing to the satisfaction of the court that the proper mine inspector and the engineers of the defendant company and the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Company have, upon due investigation and consultation, determined that a barrier pillar of less width than that stated in the injunction (that is, less 70 feet on defendant's property) is sufficient for the protection of the men employed in the mines of either company in case the mine of the other should be abandoned and allowed to fill with water, and have made duplicate surveys and filed copies of the same as required by law, or, upon such investigation and consultation shall have decided that no such barrier pillar is necessary to the safety of the employees of either company in the event aforesaid.'\n Upon appeal the supreme court of Pennsylvania affirmed the decree ( 232 Pa. 141, 81 Atl. 148), and the case comes here by virtue of  237, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, U.

It applies to every anthracite coal mine in the commonwealth employing more than ten persons; divides the anthracite coal region into eight inspection districts, with a mine inspector for each district, who is appointed by the governor of the commonwealth upon the recommendation of a board of examiners composed of three reputable coal miners and two reputable mining engineers, all to be selected by judges of the county courts, and the inspector thus appointed must be a citizen of Pennsylvania, more than thirty years of age, having a knowledge of the different svstems of working coal mines, and at least five years practical experience in anthracite coal mines of Pennsylvania, including experience in mines where noxious and explosive gases are evolved. Each inspector is to reside in the district for which he is appointed, and is to give his whole time and attention to the duties of his office. He is to examine all the collieries in his district as often as may be required, see that every necessary precaution is taken to secure the safety of the workmen, and that the provisions of the act are observed and obeyed, and is to keep the maps and plans of the mines and the records thereof with all the papers relating thereto. The act contains a multitude of provisions looking to the safety of the men employed in and about the \n\n[232 U.S. 531, 540]\n\u00a0\n mines, and deals apparently with every branch of the work and every source of danger.\n That the business of mining coal is attended with dangers that render it the proper subject of regulation by the states in the exercise of the police power is entirely settled. Holden v. Hardy, \n169 \nU.S. 366, 393\n, 42 S. L. ed. 780, 791, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 383; Consolidated Coal Co. v. Illinois, \n185 \nU.S. 203, 207\n, 46 S. L. ed. 872, 875, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 616; Barrett v. Indiana, \n229 \nU.S. 26, 29\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1050, 1052, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 694.\n Legislation requiring the owners of adjoining coal properties to cause boundary pillars of coal to be left of sufficient width to safeguard the employees of either mine in case the other should be abandoned and allowed to fill with water cannot be deemed an unreasonable exercise of the power. In effect it requires a comparatively small portion of the valuable contents of the vein to be left in place, so long as may be required for the safety of the men employed in mining upon either property.\n All of this is very frankly admitted by plaintiff in error, and the criticism upon  10 of the act is confined to the single ground that the method of fixing the width of the barrier pillar is so crude, uncertain, and unjust as to constitute a taking of property without due process of law.\n So far as the record discloses, this particular objection was not brought to the attention of the state courts as a ground for holding the section in question to be unconstitutional. The very general objection raised by plaintiff in error in its answer has been stated. The court of common pleas in its opinion, not treating the mode of defining the pillar as having any bearing upon the constitutional question, but dealing with it as a matter of interpretation, said:\n'If the constitutionality of this provision be conceded for the purpose of discussion, and if the question of the necessity for any barrier pillar at all between these properties may be regarded as an open one, the decision of that question would seem to be committed by the statute \n\n[232 U.S. 531, 541]\n\u00a0\n to the tribunal of experts thereby constituted; viz., the mine inspector and the engineers of the owners of the adjoining coal properties. The purpose of the enactment is to secure the safety of the workmen in the mines. The law declares that 'it shall be obligatory' on the mine owners to leave such a barrier pillar as the tribunal of mine experts referred to shall determine to be sufficient for that purpose. It is for them to fix its width. Until they say that none at all is needed for the safety of the men, the obligation imposed by the statute remains. . . . If, therefore, we may apply the maxim that the law does not require a vain thing, there is room for the construction that, in vesting in the inspector and engineers the power to determine how wide the barrier pillar should be to secure safety, the intent of the law-making power was to also empower them to say, if such be the fact, that the safety of the men does not require a barrier pillar of any width at all. But, be that as it may, it is evident that the act does not warrant a mine owner in refusing to permit his engineer to participate in determining the question of the width of, or the need for, a barrier simply because he, the mine owner, does not consider one necessary. In our opinion, the law requires such a pillar to be left, unless the inspector and engineers, after due examination of the premises and consideration of the subject, determine that none is needed to secure the safety of the men employed in either mine in case the other should be abandoned and allowed to fill with water.'\n\n The same view was repeated in the 'Conclusions of Law' at the close of the opinion, and evidently afforded the reason for inserting in the final decree a clause reserving to defendant the right to apply for a dissolution or modification of the injunction after action by the statutory tribunal. The supreme court affirmed the decree on the opinion of the court of common pleas. \n\n[232 U.S. 531, 542]\n\u00a0\n In a later case, Curran v. Delano, 235 Pa. 478, 485, 84 Atl. 452, it was held, in effect, that the tribunal created by the statute was to be composed of 'two mining engineers and a mine inspector;' or, as was said, 'three mine experts;' that its jurisdiction was exclusive; and that even the act of one property owner in removing the coal from its mine up to the boundary line could not deprive the statutory tribunal of its autherity, or confer jutisdiction upon a court of equity to determine the width of the boundary barrier. And see Sterrick Creek Coal Co. v. Dolph Coal Co. 11 Lack. Jur. 219.\n Although the act has been upon the statute book for over twenty years, the cases just cited are, it seems, the only ones wherein the state courts have placed an authoritative construction upon the pertinent section.\n The objections of plaintiff in error to the method of fixing the width of the barrier pillar are based upon the supposed uncertainty and want of uniformity in the membership of the statutory tribunal, and upon the fact that the statute does not expressly provide for notice to the parties interested, that the procedure is not prescribed, and that there is no right of appeal.\n The legislature has not defined with precision the width of the pillar, and it is very properly admitted that, in the nature of things, this would have been impossible, because the width necessary in each case must be determined with reference to the situation of the particular property. From this it necessarily results that it was competent for the legislature to lay down a general rule, and then establish an administrative tribunal with authority to fix the precise width or thickness of pillar that will suit the necessities of the partieular situation, and constitute a compliance with the general rule. United States v. Grimaud, \n220 U.S. 506\n, 517-522, 55 L. ed. 563, 567-569, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 480. Administrative bodies with authority not Essentially different are a recognized governmental institution. Commissions for \n\n[232 U.S. 531, 543]\n\u00a0\n the regulation of public service corporations are a familiar instance. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. \n167 \nU.S. 479, 495\n, 42 S. L. ed. 243, 251, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 896. And it has become entirely settled that powers and discretion of this character may be delegated to administrative bodies, or even to a single individual. Re Kollock, \n165 \nU.S. 526, 536\n, 41 S. L. ed. 813, 816, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 444; Wilson v. Eureka City, \n173 U.S. 32\n, 43 L. ed. 603, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 317; Gundling v. Chicago, \n177 \nU.S. 183, 186\n, 44 S. L. ed. 725, 728, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 633; Fischer v. St. Louis, \n194 \nU.S. 361, 371\n, 372 S., 48 L. ed. 1018, 1023, 1024, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 673; Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 \nU.S. 11, 25\n, 49 S. L. ed. 643, 649, 25 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 144.\n But it is insisted that under the language of the act before us the tribunal lacks uniformity and there is uncertainty respecting the manner of its constitution. It is said that on one side of the property line there might be but a single owner, while on the other side there might be several owners, and the engineers representing the latter might outnumber and combine against the representative of the single owner, and compel him to leave a barrier pillar of an unreasonable width. This objection is for present purposes sufficiently disposed of by the decisions of the supreme court of Pennsylvania, which establish that the tribunal is composed of three; namely, the inspector and two engineers. We see no difficulty in working this out in practice. The owner on each side has a single engineer in the make-up of the body; and if there be a subdivision of the property on one side of the line, there would no doubt be separate findings with respect to the frontage of each subdivision.\n It is objected that the act presupposes a condition which does not always exist; viz., that the owners of coal properties have engineers in their employ; whereas it is insisted that there are many coal owners who employ no engineer; especially among the lessors of coal property. But it cannot be seriously doubted, the business under regulation being so dangerous, that it is within the power of the state to declare that coal mining shall not be conducted \n\n[232 U.S. 531, 544]\n\u00a0\n without the employment of an engineer; and we deem it to be within the competency of the law-making power to require, also, that notice of such a proceeding be given to the lessee actually in charge of the mining operations, leaving the lessor's interest to be represented by him. It is the lessee whose conduct is to be controlled. The lessor's interest is not so directly involved, and for the purpose in hand is not opposed to that of the lessee. It is not a judicial but a quasi legislative proceeding. And if the lessor desires to participate, it is not to be supposed that he would have difficulty in obtaining a hearing.\n A requirement of reasonable notice to the lessee seems to be implied in the language of the section. There is to be a 'determination' by a tribunal of which the lessee's representative is a member. Assuming, as we do, that for constitutional reasons there must be a fair though summary hearing, it requires no very clear expression to justify such a construction of the section as will render notice obligatory. Certainly this court ought not to adopt a contrary construction in the absence of something in the state decisions to require it.\n Respecting this and some of the other objections, it should be said that the difficulties suggested are hypothetical rather than practical. Plaintiff in error had actual notice in fact, and made no objection on the score of lack of sufficient notice. Its lessor is not objecting. Plaintiff in error presumably has an engineer competent to represent it, or could readily employ one. It refused to enter the conference for other reasons, and the refusal can be justified in law only upon the theory that the section is wholly void.\n We may once more repeat what has been so often said, that one who would strike down a state statute as violative of the Federal Constitution must show he is within the class with respect to whom the act is unconstitutional, and must show that the alleged unconstitutional feature \n\n[232 U.S. 531, 545]\n\u00a0\n injures him, and so operates as to deprive him of rights protected by the Federal Constitution. Southern R. Co. v. King, \n217 \nU.S. 524, 534\n, 54 S. L. ed. 868, 871, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 594; Standard Stock Food Co. v. Wright, \n225 \nU.S. 540, 550\n, 56 S. L. ed. 1197, 1201, 32 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 27.\n It is to be presumed, until the contrary appears, that the administrative body would have acted with reasonable regard to the property rights of plaintiff in error; and certainly if there had been any arbitrary exercise of its powers its determination would have been subject to judicial review. New York ex rel. Lieberman v. Van De Carr, \n199 \nU.S. 552, 562\n, 50 S. L. ed. 305, 310, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 144; Bradley v. Richmond, \n227 \nU.S. 477, 483\n, 57 S. L. ed. 603, 605, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 318.\n Indeed, the statute seems to contemplate some judicial control, for it prescribes no penalty for a violation of the findings of the engineers and inspector, nor any mode of enforcing their determination except by a suit for injunction under art. 15 of the act. In such a suit a party deeming himself aggrieved because of arbitrary action by the statutory tribunal may presumably have his opportunity to be heard with respect to this as well as other fundamental defenses.\n It is objected that the act does not state whether the tribunal must be unanimous in order to reach a determination, or what shall be done in case of disagreement; and it is argued that in case of such disagreement the solution of the question to be determined might be delayed for such a length of time as to embarrass the mining operations and throw the workmen out of employment. Here, again, plaintiff in error seems to be unnecessarily borrowing trouble, but we will deal with the point on its merits. This particular objection does not seem to be met by the decision of the state court, either in the present case, or in that of Curran v. Delano, 235 Pa. 478, 84 Atl. 452. They seem to hold simply that the tribunal is made up of three, without deciding what function is to be performed by the respective members, nor how a conclusion is to be reached. That \n\n[232 U.S. 531, 546]\n\u00a0\n being so, it is not incumbent upon us to construe the statute in this regard; but rather, to say merely whether the section admits of any reasonable construction that will sustain its constitutionality.\n For in cases other than such as arise under the contract clause of the Constitution, it is the appropriate function of the court of last resort of a state to determine the meaning of the local statutes. And in exercising the jurisdiction conferred by  237, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 227], it is proper for this court rather to wait until the state court has adopted a construction of the statute under attack than to assume in advance that a construction will be adopted such as to render the law obnoxious to the Federal Constitution. Bachtel v. Wilson, \n204 \nU.S. 36, 40\n, 359 S., 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 243; Adams v. Russell, \n229 \nU.S. 353, 360\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1224, 1227, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 846.\n And, even aside from the consideration just adverted to, it is a general and fundamental rule that if a statute be reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, one of which would render it unconstitutional and the other valid, it is the duty of the courts to adopt that construction which will uphold its validity; there being a strong presumption that the law-making body has intended to act within, and not in excess of, its constitutional authority. Sinking Fund Cases, \n99 \nU.S. 700, 718\n, 25 S. L. ed. 496, 501; Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623, 661\n, 31 S. L. ed. 205, 210, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 273; Knights Templars' & M. Life Indemnity Co. v.

Rep. 527.\n Approaching the subject from this point of view, we observe first the language of the section-'such width of pillar to be determined by the engineers of the adjoining property owners, together with the inspector of the district in which the mine is situated.' Attention has already been called to the qualifications of the inspector, and the safeguards surrounding the mode of his appointment. The statute confers upon him most important powers, and gives him access to complete information \n\n[232 U.S. 531, 547]\n\u00a0\n respecting the problems that come before him. There is provision, also, for his removal if neglectful or incompetent, or if guilty of malfeasance in office.\n In the clause in question, we think it is quite reasonable to interpret the words 'together with the inspector of the district' as meaning that the inspector shall be of the quorum,-shall participate in any determination that is made. But the matter is 'to be determined by the engineers . . . together with the inspector.' The phrase, of course, admits of the interpretation that if the engineers agree, the added approval of the inspector shall end the matter. We think it not an unreasonable construction that if the engineers disagree they shall submit their differences to the inspector, and that a determination agreed to by one of them in conjunction with the inspector shall fulfil the requirements of the act. It must be remembered that this tribunal is to settle, not a private property right, but a matter affecting the public safety; hence, in the absence of clear language to the contrary, the section is open to the construction that, as in other public matters, a majority of the referees or arbitrators may act. Omaha v. Omaha Water Co. \n218 \nU.S. 180, 192\n, 54 S. L. ed. 991, 996, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1084, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 615.\n It is further objected that the statute provides for no appeal from the determination of the tribunal. But in such cases the right of appeal on other than constitutional grounds may be conferred or with held, at the discretion of the legislature. As already pointed out, an appeal on fundamental grounds in this instance seems to inhere in the very practice prescribed by the statute for the enforcement of the determination of the statutory tribunal. Were this not expressed in the act, it would none the less be implied, at least so far as pertains to any violation of rights guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. Yick Wo v.

HUDSON COUNTY(1914)\nNo. 225\nArgued: March 4, 1914Decided: June 8, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 317, 318]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frank Bergen for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 317, 320]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James J. Murphy for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error, Port Richmond & Bergen Point Ferry Company, was incorporated in 1848 by special act of the legislature of New York for the purpose of maintaining a ferry across the Kill von Kull from Port Richmond, Staten Island, New York, to Bergen Point, Hudson county, New Jersey. \n1\n This act prescribed rates of ferriage, as did also the amendatory acts of 1857 (chap. 692) and 1868 (chap. 778).\n The ferry is not operated in connection with any railroad.\n In July, 1905, the board of chosen freeholders of the county of Hudson, New Jersey, passed two resolutions \n\n[234 U.S. 317, 321]\n\u00a0\n fixing the rates to be taken at the ferry of this company within the county of Hudson for the transportation of foot passengers for single trips to the New York terminal, and for round trips to that terminal and return, respectively. This action was taken under the authority of an act of the legislature of New Jersey, passed in 1799, providing as follows: 'That the board of chosen freeholders shall be, and they hereby are, empowered and directed to fix the rates to be taken at the several ferries within their respective counties, and the same, from time to time, to revise, alter, amend, or make anew at their discretion.' Comp. Stat. (N. J .) p. 2308. On certiorari, the supreme court of the state of New Jersey sustained the validity of these resolutions against the objection that they were repugnant to the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution (80 N. J. L. 614, 77 Atl. 1046), and its judgment was affirmed by the court of errors and appeals. 82 N. J. L. 536, 82 Atl. 729. This writ of error is prosecuted.\n The plaintiff in error contends that the action of the board is void for the reason that the transportation is interstate, and the fixing of rates therefor is a direct regulation of interstate commerce.\n At common law, the right to maintain a public ferry lies in franchise; in England such a ferry could not be set up without the King's license; and, in this country, the right has been made the subject of legislative grant. Blissett v. Hart, Willes, Rep. 508; Re Fay, 15 Pick. 243, 249, 253; New York v. Starin, 106 N. Y. 1, 10, 11, 12 N. E. 631; 3 Kent, Com. 458; 2 Washb. Real Prop. 4th ed. 292. The states have been accustomed to grant such franchises not only for ferries wholly intrastate, but also for those to be operated from their shores to other states. Coolly, Const. Lim. 740. They have fixed the rates for such ferriage; and this has been done both directly by the legislature and also through designated courts and local boards acting under legislative sanction. The prac- \n\n[234 U.S. 317, 322]\n\u00a0\n tice has had continuous illustration in a great variety of instances, from the foundation of the government to the present day. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The court of errors and appeals of New Jersey in the case of Hudson County v. State (1853) 24 N. J. L. 718, sustained the authority of the board to prescribe ferry rates between New Jersey and New York. Speaking through Elmer, J., the court thus described conditions existing at the time of the passage of the above-mentioned act of 1799 and its purpose: 'When the act was passed, long before the invention of steamboats, ferries were generally the property of one or two individuals, established for the public convenience and private gain, by the owners of the shore, sometimes by virtue of a grant or law, and sometimes without any public authority. The owner or keeper resided on the one bank or the other of the river over which the ferry passed, and kept his boats and other apparatus where he resided. The ferry was commonly known and designated by the name of the place from which it started, and where such owner resided, as Paulus Hook ferry; or from the name of the \n\n[234 U.S. 317, 323]\n\u00a0\n owner or keeper, as Dunk's ferry, Corriel's ferry, etc. In many cases, where the river was not too wide, a bell or horn, or some other signal was established on the side of the river opposite to that where the owner lived, so that persons coming there who desired to pass over, could make known their wishes. Probably but few, if any, of the keepers, had a boat constantly running, or started at any particular hour. In some cases, there were ferry owners on both sides of the river; but the ferry or ferries on each side were considered and spoken of as distinct ferries, and had distinct owners\n___ and specially refer to the different acts . . . it is sufficient to say, that they show a course of legislation, commencing in 1714, and continued till near the passage of the act of 1799, by which the ferries over the waters dividing this state from the adjoining states were regulated by the laws of New Jersey, in those cases where ferry establishmenta were with this state. . . . To effect this object [i. e., of the act] the word 'ferries' must be interpreted to mean, what in those laws it had obviously included, ferries the owners or keepers of which resided in this state, or which had one of their termini where fares were demanded, in this state, and not merely ferries in the technical meaning, of an entire passage across a river or other water. . . . It set up without public authority, it [the ferry] was liable at any time to be stopped, or, in the discretion of the legislature, to be regulated. . . . It is sufficient, to authorize these rates, that it is a public ferry, and that there is no law prescribing rates for it, inconsistent with the exercise of the power by the board of chosen freeholders.' Supra, pp. 721-724, 726. This decision was followed by the state court in the present case. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[234 U.S. 317, 324]\n\u00a0\n In view of the extended consideration which the decisions of this court bearing upon the questions involved have received in recent opinions ( St. Clair County v. Interstate Sand & Car Transfer Co. \n192 U.S. 454\n, 48 L. ed. 518, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 300; New York C. & H. R. R. Co. v. Hudson County, \n227 U.S. 248\n, 57 L. ed. 499, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269), it is not necessary to review them at length. The authority of the state to grant franchises for ferries to be operated from its shores across boundary waters was distinctly recognized in Fanning v. Gregoire, 16 How. 524, 14 L. ed. 1043; Conway v. Taylor, 1 Black, 603, 17 L. ed. 191; and Wiggins Ferry Co. \n\n[234 U.S. 317, 325]\n\u00a0\n v. Fast St. Louis, \n107 U.S. 365\n, 27 L. ed. 419, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 257. While in Fanning v. Gregoire, supra, the plaintiff's license for a ferry across the Mississippi river from Dubuque, Iowa, was held, under the terms of the grant, not to be exclusive as against the subsequent licensee, the court said that the commercial power of Congress did not 'interfere with the police power of the states in granting ferry licenses.' In Conway v. Taylor, supra, the court upheld a judgment which restrained the appellants ( the owners of a ferry from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Newport, Kentucky) from conducting the ferry from the Kentucky shore to Ohio in violation of the rights of the appellees under their Kentucky franchise. Referring to the latter, the court said:\n'The franchise in confined to the transit from the shore of the state. The same rights which she claims for herself she concedes to others. . . . It was shown in the argument at bar that similar laws exist in most, if not all, the states bordering upon those streams. They exist in other states of the Union bounded by navigable waters.' With respect to 'ordinary commercial navigation,' the authority of the appellants to transport persons and property from the Kentucky shore was undoubted. The owners of the Kentucky franchise, it was said, had no right to exclude or restrain those who were prosecuting 'the business of commerce in good faith, without the regularity or purposes of ferry trips,' but, as the appellants' boat was run 'openly and avowedly as a ferryboat,' as 'that was her business,' the injunction was sustained. After referring to the commerce clause, the opinion concluded: 'Undoubtedly, the states, in conferring ferry rights, may pass laws so infringing the commercial power of the nation that it would be the duty of this court to annul or control them. . . . There has been now nearly three-quarters of a century of practical interpretation of the Constitution. During all that time, as before the Constitution had its birth, the states have exercised \n\n[234 U.S. 317, 326]\n\u00a0\n the power to establish and regulate ferries; Congress never. We have sought in vain for any act of Congress which involves the exercise of this power. That the authority lies within the scope of 'that immense mass' of undelegated powers which 'are reserved to the states respectively,' we think too clear to admit of doubt.' These cases were cited with approval in Wiggins Ferry Co. v. East St. Louis, \n107 U.S. 365\n, 27 L. ed. 419, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 257. There, the ferry company was an Illinois corporation and held a franchise granted by the legislature of that state for the operation of a ferry from East St. Louis, Illinois to St. Louis, Missouri. The payment of a license tax imposed upon the company in Illinois, for the privilege of conducting the ferry, was resisted under the commerce clause, but the contention was overruled, the court holding that 'the levying of a tax upon vessels or other water-craft, or the exaction of a license fee by the state within which the property subject to the exaction has its situs, is not a regulation of commerce within the meaning of the Constitution.' ( Id. p. 373.)\n\n It is manifest, however, that the transportation of persons and property from one state to another is none the less interstate commerce because conducted by ferry; and it is not open to question that ferries maintained for that purpose are subject to the regulating power of Congress. It necessarily follows that whatever may properly be regarded as a direct burden upon interstate commerce, as conducted by ferries operating between states, it is beyond the competency of the states to impose. This was definitely decided in Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 U.S. 196\n, 29 L. ed. 158, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 382, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 826. The commonwealth of Pennsylvania had imposed a tax upon the ferry company, based upon the estimated value of its capital stock, upon the ground that it was doing business within the state.\n The company was incorporated in New Jersey and maintained a ferry from Gloucester, in that state, to Philadelphia. Save for the wharf that it leased at the latter place, its \n\n[234 U.S. 317, 327]\n\u00a0\n property, including its boats, had its situs in New Jersey; and its entire business consisted in ferrying. The tax upon the 'receiving and landing of passengers and freight at the wharf in Philadelphia,' which was a necessary incident to the transportation across the Delaware river, was a tax upon that transportation; and in this view the tax was held to be void as one laid upon interstate commerce. 'The only interference of the state with the landing and receiving of passengers and freight, which is permissible,' said the court, 'is confined to such measures as will prevent confusion among the vessels, and collision between them, insure their safety and convenience, and facilitate the discharge or receipt of their passengers and freight, which fall under the general head of port regulations.' Id. p. 206. It was said that the statement of Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbs v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 203, 6 L. ed. 23, 71, had relation to ferries entirely within the state. 'Ferries,' continued the court, 'between one of the states and a foreign country cannot be deemed . . . beyond the control of Congress under the commercial power. . . . neither are ferries over waters separating states.' And it was pointed out that Congress had passed various laws respecting international and interstate ferries, the validity of which was not open to question (Rev. Stat.  2792, 4233 (Rule 7), 4370, 4426).\n But, it view of the nature of the subject and the diversified regulation which was necessary, it was recognized that the states were entitled to exercise a measure of regulatory power not inconsistent with the Federal authority. The court said: 'It is true that, from the earliest period in the history of the government, the states have authorized and regulated ferries, not only over waters entirely within their limits, but over waters separating them; and it may be conceded that in many respects the states can more advantageously manage \n\n[234 U.S. 317, 328]\n\u00a0\n such interstate ferries than the general government; and that the privilege of keeping a ferry, with a right to take toll for passengers and freight, is a franchise grantable by the state, to be exercised within such limits and under such regulations as may be required for the safety, comfort, and convenience of the public. Still the fact remains that such a ferry is a means, and a necessary means, of commercial intercourse between the states bordering on their dividing waters, and it must therefore be conducted without the imposition by the states of taxes or other burdens upon the commerce between them. Freedom from such impositions does not, of course, imply exemption from reasonable charges, as compensation for the carriage of persons, in the way of tolls or fares, or from the ordinary taxation to which other property is subjected, any more than like freedom of transportation of land implies such exemption.' (Id. p. 217.)\n In Covington & C. Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, \n154 U.S. 204\n, 38 L. ed. 962, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 649, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1087, the question related to the power of the state of Kentucky to regulate tolls upon an interstate bridge built pursuant to the concurrent action of Kentucky and Ohio. The power was denied under the commerce clause. Reviewing the authorities, the opinion was expressed that the principle involved was identical with that applied in Wabash, St. L. & P. Co. v. Illinois, \n118 U.S. 557\n, 30 L. ed. 244, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 31, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 4, with respect to interstate railroad rates, and that (at least, in the absence of mutual action) it was impossible for either state to fix a tariff of charges. It was said that it did not follow that because a state might 'authorize a ferry or bridge from its own territory to that of another state,' it might 'regulate the charges upon such bridge or ferry.' It was pointed out, however, that the state of Kentucky, by the statute in question, attempted 'to reach out and secure for itself a right to prescribe a rate of toll applicable not only to persons crossing from Kentucky to Ohio, but from Ohio to Kentucky,'-a right which practically nullified \n\n[234 U.S. 317, 329]\n\u00a0\n the corresponding right of Ohio to fix tolls from her own state.' (Id. p. 220.) And this was an adequate basis for the judgment. Four of the justices of the court, concurring in the judgment, announced their view that 'the several states have the power to establish and regulate ferries and bridges, and the rates of toll thereon, whether within one state, or between two adjoining states, subject to the paramount authority of Congress over interstate commerce.'\n In Louisville & J. Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, \n188 U.S. 385\n, 47 L. ed. 513, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 463, where a Kentucky corporation conducting a ferry across the Ohio river between Kentucky and Indiana held ferry franchises from both states, it was decided that the franchise from Indiana could not be taxed by Kentucky. The court said that the franchises were distinct; that each was 'property entitled to the protection of the law;' and that the Indiana franchise must be regarded as an incorporeal hereditament, having its situs in that state, and hence, as beyond the jurisdiction of Kentucky. The case of St. Clair County v. Interstate Sand & Car Transfer Co. \n192 U.S. 454\n, 48 L. ed. 518, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 300, involved the right of a county in Illinois to recover statutory penalties for carrying on, without a ferry license, the transportation of cars across the Mississippi river between points in Illinois and Missouri. Conceding, arguendo, that the police power of a state extends 'to the establishment, regulation, and licensing of ferries on a navigable stream, being the boundary between two states,' it was held that the business of transporting railroad cars was not a ferry business in the proper sense; and that the requirements of the ordinance in question made it a direct burden upon interstate commerce. The ordinance was therefore held to be invalid. In New York C. & H. R. R. Co v. Hudson County, \n227 U.S. 248\n, 57 L. ed. 499, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 269, the question concerned the authority of the New Jersey board to fix rates for a ferry between Weehawken, New Jersey, and New York city. \n\n[234 U.S. 317, 330]\n\u00a0\n It appeared that the ferry was operated in connection with a railroad, and it was concluded that the action of Congress with respect thereto (act to regulate commerce,  1, 24 Stat. at L. 379, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3154) had the effect of freeing the subject from state control.\n Coming, then, to the question now presented,-whether a state may fix reasonable rates for ferriage from its shore to the shore of another state,- regard must be had to the basic principle involved. That principle is, as repeatedly declared, that as to those subjects which require a general system or uniformity of regulation, the power of Congress is exclusive; that, in other matters, admitting of diversity of treatment according to the special requirements of local conditions, the states may act within their respective jurisdictions until Congress sees fit to act; and that, when Congress does act, the exercise of its authority overrides all conflicting state legislation.

It is this principle that is applied in holding that a state may not impose direct burdens upon interstate commerce, for this is to say that the states may not directly regulate or restrain that which, from its nature, should be under the control of the one authority, and be free from restriction save as it is governed by valid Federal rule. Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 U.S. 204\n, 29 L. ed. 162, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 382, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 826. It was this principle which governed the decision in Wabash, St. L. & P. R. Co. v. Illinois, \n118 U.S. 557\n, 30 L. ed. 244, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 31, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 4, as to interstate railroad rates. Considering the conditions of interstate railroad trans- \n\n[234 U.S. 317, 331]\n\u00a0\n portation, which might extend not only from one state to another, but through a series of states, or across the continent, and the consequences which would ensue if each state should undertake to fix rates for such portions of continuous interstate hauls as might be within its territory, the conclusion was reached that 'this species of regulation' was one 'which must be, if established at all, of a general and national character,' and could not be 'safely and wisely remitted to local rules.' (Id. p. 557.)\n But, in the case of ferries, we have a subject of a different character. We dismiss from consideration those ferries which are operated in connection with railroads, and cases, if any, where the ferriage is part of a longer and continuous transportation. Ferries, such as are involved in the present case, are simply means of transit from shore to shore. These have always been regarded as instruments of local convenience, which, for the proper protection of the public, are subject to local regulation; and where the ferry is conducted over a boundary stream, each jurisdiction with respect to the ferriage from its shore has exercised this protective power. There are a multitude of such ferries throughout the country, and, apart from certain rules as to navigation, they have not engaged the attention of Congress. We also put on one side the question of prohibitory or discriminatory requirements, or burdensome exactions imposed by the state, which may be said to interfere with the guaranteed freedom of interstate intercourse, or with constitutional rights of property. The present question is simply one of reasonable charges. It is argued that the mere fact that interstate transportation is involved is sufficient to defeat the local regulation of rates, because, it is said, that it amounts to a regulation of interstate commerce. But this would not be deemed a sufficient ground for invalidating the local action without considering the nature of the regulation and the special subject to which it relates. Quarantine and pilotage \n\n[234 U.S. 317, 332]\n\u00a0\n regulations may be said to be quite as direct in their operation, but they are not obnoxious when not in conflict with Federal rules. The fundamental test, to which we have referred, must be applied; and the question is whether, with regard to rates, there is any inherent necessity for a single regulatory power over these numerous ferries across boundary streams; whether, in view of the character of the subject and the variety of regulation required, it is one which demands the exclusion of local authority. Upon this question we can entertain no doubt. It is true that in the case of a given ferry between two states there might be a difference in the charge for ferriage from one side, as compared with that for ferriage from the other. But this does not alter the aspect of the subject. The question is still one with respect to a ferry, which necessarily implies transportation for a short distance, almost invariably between two points only, and unrelated to other transportation. It thus presents a situation essentially local, requiring regulation according to local conditions. It has never been supposed that because of the absence of Federal action the public interest was unprotected from extortion, and that in order to secure reasonable charges in a myriad of such different local instances, exhibiting an endless variety of circumstance, it would be necessary for Congress to act directly, or to establish for that purpose a Federal agency. The matter is illuminated by the consideration of this alternative, for the point of the contention is that, there being no Federal regulation, the ferry rates are to be deemed free from all control. The practical advantages of having the matter dealt with by the states are obvious, and are illustrated by the practice of one hundred and twenty-five years. And in view of the character of the subject, we find no sound objection to its continuance. If Congress at any time undertakes to regulate such rates, its action will, of course, control.\n If the state may exercise this power, it necessarily \n\n[234 U.S. 317, 333]\n\u00a0\n follows that it may not, in its exercise, derogate from the similar authority of another state. The state power can extend only to the transactions within its own territory and the ferriage from its own shore. It follows that the fact that rates were fixed by New York did not preclude New Jersey from establishing reasonable rates with respect to the ferry establishment maintained on its side.\n With respect to the rates for round trips, we do not construe the ordinance as requiring the company to issue round-trip tickets at its office in New Jersey. We may not look into the testimony, and it does not appear that such a construction has been placed upon the ordinance by the state court. Viewed as a limitation upon rates charged for such round-trip tickets, when sold by the company in New Jersey, we think that the ordinance is valid, being one relating to the transactions of the company in New Jersey, and the charges there enforced. Whether it would be competent for the state, through the local board, to require the company to issue round-trip tickets, is a question not presented by the record, and we express no opinion upon it.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See also Laws of New York, 1857, chap. 692; 1860, chap. 266; 1864, chap. 290; 1868, chap. 778; 1873, chap. 300; 1881, chap. 652. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] A few of these instances may be cited:\n New York.-Across Lake Champlain: Laws of 1803, chap. 37; 1810 chap. 61; 1812, chap. 60.

This was the case with most, if not all, the ferries between Philadelphia and what is now called Camden; and the ferries on each side were regulated and governed by the laws of the state in which such owner or keeper resided. Sail and rowboats, and flats or scows, were the vessels in use, as is manifest from the act itself. . . . The act meant to authorize, and did authorize, the boards of freeholders in the several counties, to regulate the fares to be taken at the ferry situate within that county; that is, at the ferry establishment of the owner of keeper. . . . Even if it might happen, upon this construction, that one board might establish one set of rates at one side, and another board another set on the other side, or that each state might have different regulations, where the ferry was over one of the rivers forming the boundary between this and another state, I do not see that there would be any important conflict of authority. Each power regulated what was done within its own jurisdiction, and left to others to regulate what was done in theirs. Existing ferries between this state and New York, and this state and Pennsylvania, are now, in numerous instances, regulated by the laws of this state, without the occurrence of any difficulty. . . .

BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF TOWN OF LAS VEGAS(1914)\nNo. 218\nArgued: Decided: March 9, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 604, 605]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John D. W. Veeder for appellants.\n Messrs. Charles A. Spiess and S. B. Davis, Jr., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Action for mandamus brought by appellants in the district court of the county of San Miguel, then in the territory of New Mexico, against appellees as trustees of the town of Las Vegas, to require them to execute a deed or deeds to the property described in the petition. The appellees filed an answer to the petition and also a counterclaim. Those papers set out the history of the Las Vegas grant, preceding and subsequent to its confirmation by the act of Congress hereinafter referred to and the final patent to the town. Motions to strike them out were overruled, and demurrers to them were also overruled. An answer having been filed to the counterclaim by appellants, portions of which were struck out by the court \n\n[232 U.S. 604, 606]\n\u00a0\n on motion of appellees, after hearing judgment was rendered dismissing the petition. The judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the territory.\n The petition alleges appellants to be the owners in fee simple and holders of a perfect title to the land described therein, and that it lies within the boundaries of 'the Las Vegas grant.' That they acquired the title thereto between the 4th of October, 1888, and the 1st of July, 1894, by purchase from the then owners and occupants of the several portions comprising the tract, and obtained deeds of conveyance therefor, and afterwards instituted proceedings in the district court of San Miguel county against certain named persons 'and all of the unknown claimants of interests in the lands and premises' adverse to appellants, to quiet their title to the lands, and that on September 15, 1894, a decree was duly entered in the cause confirming and establishing in them an estate in fee simple, absolute, against any and all and every adverse claim of all persons whomsoever, and quieting and setting at rest the title to the land against appellees. A copy of the decree is attached to the petition.\n The petition also alleges that the Las Vegas grant was confirmed by act of Congress on June 21, 1860 [12 Stat. at L. 71, chap. 167], to the town of Las Vegas, and became thereby segregated from the public domain and the property of the grantee and its privies.\n That Jefferson Reynolds, Eugenio Romero, Charles Ilfeld, Elisha V. Long, Isidor V. Gallegos, Felix Esquibel, and F. H. Pierce are the trustees of the town, duly appointed by the district court of San Miguel county under and by virtue of an act of the legislative assembly of the territory of New Mexico, entitled, 'An Act to Provide for the Management of the Las Vegas Grant, and for Other Purposes,' approved March 12, 1903, and that it was made the duty of the board of trustees to make, execute, and deliver deeds of conveyance to all persons who held a \n\n[232 U.S. 604, 607]\n\u00a0\n title to any lands of the grant, which became or was perfect or entitled them to the possession thereof at the time of the acquisition of New Mexico, under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, or at any time subsequent thereto.\n That appellants made application to the board of trustees to execute and deliver a deed to them of the tract of land described, the title to which had become perfected by the decree hereinbefore specified, but the board declined to recognize the title of appellants and to issue the deed of conveyance asked for.\n Mandamus, directed to the board, was prayed.\n The ground of appellants' petition, therefore, is that they possess a perfect title established by the suit and decree referred to which entitled them to a deed from the trustees under the act of the legislative assembly of March 12, 1903. Laws of New Mexico, 1903, p. 72. That act becomes a factor for consideration. By it the district court of San Miguel county is vested with jurisdiction to manage, control, and administer the land grant. In the exercise of such jurisdiction power is conferred to appoint a board of trustees from among the residents upon the grant. Provision is made for their organization, and the court is empowered to exercise the same control over their acts as courts of equity exercise over receivers. And it is provided that 'this act shall not interfere with or prejudice any vested rights in and to any of the lands embraced within the bounds of said Las Vegas grant, or preclude a judicial examination or adjustment thereof, and it is hereby made the duty of said board of trustees to make, execute, and deliver deeds of conveyance to any and all persons who hold a title to any such lands, which became or was perfect or entitled them to the possession thereof at the time of the acquisition of New Mexico, under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo [9 Stat. at L. 922], or at any other time subsequent thereto.'\n By  9 the board has power, under the direction of the \n\n[232 U.S. 604, 608]\n\u00a0\n court, to lease, sell, or mortgage any part or parts of the grants, the proceeds to be used 'for such purpose as said board and court may deem to be for the best interests of the community for the benefit of which such grant was made.'\n It will be seen, therefore, that the statute makes it the duty of the trustees, it may be under the direction of the court, to execute and deliver deeds of conveyance to anyone having the kind of title described; that is, which had become or was perfect, or entitled such person to land which he claimed at the time of the acquisition of New Mexico, under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, or at any other time subsequent thereto. Appellants rely upon such title, as we have seen, as established by the suit to quiet title and the decree rendered therein. A consideration of this suit and decree, therefore, becomes necessary.\n The suit was brought in the district court of San Miguel county, territory of New Mexico, by appellants against certain named defendants and 'all unknown claimants of interests in the premises and lands' which were described. The complaint alleged that appellants were owners in fee simple and the occupants and possessors of the land, that it lay within the exterior boundaries of a grant of land made by the Mexican government to certain named parties in the year 1835 'for the use and benefit of the inhabitants and settlers of the town of Las Vegas;' that the grant was known in the archives of the surveyor general of New Mexico as private land claim number 20, and, as such, on June 21, 1860, duly confirmed by act of Congress of the United States to the town of Las Vegas, and thereby became segregated from the public domain. That the land described in the complaint as belonging to appellants was taken possession of by them and their grantors under and by virtue of the terms and provisions of the said Las Vegas grant, and the laws of the territory of New Mexico applicable thereto, more than \n\n[232 U.S. 604, 609]\n\u00a0\n ten years prior to the commencement of the suit, and that they and their grantors from whom they claim title and from whom they have deeds of conveyance have been in the actual, exclusive, open, and uninterrupted adverse possession under claim of title, and have therefore a good and indefeasible title in fee simple to the land, and are entitled to occupy and hold possession thereof.\n It was alleged that certain persons, naming them, made some claim adverse to the complainants in the suit (appellants here), but what the nature and extent of their claim was complainants were unable to state. And it was alleged that there were certain unknown successors of the Fairview Town Company who made some claim of interest in and title to the land, but the nature and extent of the claim were unknown.\n Then the following was alleged: 'That your orators are credibly informed and believe that certain unknown persons designated in this bill as 'unknown claimants of interests in the premises adverse to your orators' also make some claim of interest and title in and to the said tract of land adverse to the estate of your orators, but what the nature and extent of the said claim of said unknown persons in and to said tract of land is, is likewise to your orators unknown.'\n It was finally alleged that all of the claims and pretenses of the defendants in the suit, known and unknown, adverse to the estate of complainants, were of no avail against their title, and constituted a cloud upon it. It was prayed that the title of complainants be established against all of the defendants, and that it be forever quieted and set at rest, and process was prayed.\n An affidavit for publication of process was filed in which it was recited, among other things, 'that the place of residence is unknown and the whereabouts cannot be discovered of any and all of the defendants designated as unknown claimants of interest in the premises and lands \n\n[232 U.S. 604, 610]\n\u00a0\n described in the bill of complaint, who claim adversely to the complainants, George E. Priest, Melvin W. Quick, and Charles M. Benjamin.'\n Publication was made. There was no appearance on the part of any of the defendants, and the bill of complaint was ordered to be taken as confessed; and it was decreed that all of the defendants were brought before the court by proper process, and that the court had jurisdiction of them, whether known or unknown, and jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the suit; that the land lay within the exterior boundaries of the Las Vegas grant, as described, was confirmed by Congress as alleged, and that in consequence of the grant and confirmation the land was segregated from the public domain and became and was the private property of the grantees and their privies. That the complainants in the suit and their grantors from whom they claimed and from whom they had deeds of conveyance were in the adverse possession of the land as alleged, and that as a consequence thereof complainants were entitled to the relief for which they prayed. And it was decreed that the right, title, and interest of complainants was an estate in fee simple absolute, and that the same be established in them, and that the defendants be barred and estopped from having or claiming or asserting any right, title, or interest whatsoever adverse to the complainants or any of them, and that their title to the land, and each and every part thereof, be forever quieted and set at rest.\n It will be observed that the title set up by appellants in the suit to quiet title, and sustained by the decree, depended upon adverse possession,-in other words, upon the statute of limitations; and the trial court in the case at bar considered that aspect of the case and decree only, and found that the statute did not begin to run until after the passage of the act of 1903 and the appointment of the board of trustees; and that possession of appellants \n\n[232 U.S. 604, 611]\n\u00a0\n and their predecessors in title for a period of ten years prior to the act and the appointment of the trustees could not ripen any title against appellees.\n The court, therefore, adjudged that the decree in favor of appellants of September 15, 1894, quieting title in them, was not binding upon appellees, and the petition herein was dismissed.\n The supreme court, however, considered this position untenable, saying that if 'the court had jurisdiction, as against defendants, to render the decree of 1894, all the findings upon which that decree proceeds are likewise conclusive against it, and it avails nothing to inquire, as did the trial court, into whether such findings were as a matter of fact properly made.' And the court said: 'The whole question, therefore, is whether the proceedings of 1894 bind the present defendants,' the board of trustees of the town of Las Vegas.\n The court answered the question in the negative, basing the answer on the provisions of the laws of the territory. Sections 4010 and 4011 of the Complied Laws of 1897 of the territory, the court said, provide for an action to quiet title to real property, and permit the complainant to make parties, 'by their names as near as can be ascertained,' those who claim an interest adverse to him, the unknown heirs of any deceased person who made claim in his lifetime, 'and all unknown persons who may claim any interest or title adverse to plaintiff, . . . unknown heirs by the style of unknown heirs of such deceased person, and said unknown persons who may claim any interest or title adverse to plaintiff by the name and style of unknown claimants of interests in the premises adverse to the plaintiff, and the service of process on, and notice of said suit against, defendants, shall be made in the same manner as now provided by law in other civil \n\n[232 U.S. 604, 612]\n\u00a0\n suits.' Service by publication, the court said, is provided by  2964, and may be ordered upon a sworn pleading or affidavit 'showing that the defendant, or any one or more of them in said cause, resides or has gone out of the territory, has concealed himself within it, has avoided service of process on him, or is in any other manner so situated that process cannot be served upon him or them, or that his or their names, or place of residence, is unknown, or that his or their whereabouts cannot be discovered.' [16 N. M. 695, 696, 120 Pac. 894.]\n The provisions of these sections, appellants contended, were pursued by them in their suit to quiet title, and, after citing them, as we have said, and the allegations of the bill of complaint therein, the court considered the effect of the decree therein upon the board of trustees of the town of Las Vegas, appellees herein, and said: 'The board was not eo nomine a party, nor indeed was it in existence in 1894. Any effect of the decree upon it must therefore result from its holding under some party to the cause. That it is not holding under any of the individuals named is conceded. That it is not affected by the futile provisions of the decree quieting title against 'any person whatsoever' is evident. The only remaining alternative is that it is bound because of the fact that 'all the unknown claimants of interests in the premises adverse to complainants' [are named in the complaint] were cited in the publication, and were decreed against in the court's disposition of the case, and that this was a binding adjudication against the defendant under  4011, Comp. Laws above quoted. But in 1894, were the owners of the Las Vegas grant, whom defendant now represents, unknown owners? The complainants certainly knew the exact status of the matter, for their complaint, as we have seen, in terms alleged that the premises were a part of the Las Vegas grant 'on June 21, 1860, duly confirmed by act of Congress of the United States to the town of Las Vegas.' \n\n[232 U.S. 604, 613]\n\u00a0\n 'The complainants thus knew that the town of Las Vegas was the confirmee of the grant, and that if complainants' title had, by adverse possession, been wrested from anyone, it was from such confirmee. Knowing this, we are of opinion that it was their duty to have made the town of Las Vegas a party, and that the term 'unknown owners' could not be utilized to devest title from what the act of Congress, no less than plaintiffs' conceded knowledge, told them was the true ownership of the property.' The court commented upon the abuse which may be made of statute providing for constructive service, and the necessity to so construe them as 'to hold that where the real owner may be brought into court by name, his property may not be taken by an advertisement against unknown owners,' and that where, 'as in this case, the locus of the title is definitely declared of record, and such is confessedly known to the complainant, it is but an exaction of good faith that the holder of such title should be summoned by name in order that he may appear and defend. To exact less is to open the doors wide to insidious attacks upon property rights, and, indeed, to ignore the statute which in terms provides (Comp. Laws,  4011) that persons claiming interests 'may be made parties defendant by their names, as near as the same can be ascertained.\"\n To the contention that the designation of ownership of the Las Vegas grant as 'unknown claimants' was justified because the town of Las Vegas, as used in the act of confirmation, was a mere aggregation of people without corporate organization, and that the suit became one practically against the individuals residing on the grant, and that as to these the designation of unknown owners was necessary and proper, the court said it was not impressed, nor by the other contention that there was no officer upon whom process could have been served, and replied to the first contention, as it said it was replied in \n\n[232 U.S. 604, 614]\n\u00a0\n Maese v. Herman, \n183 U.S. 572\n, 46 L. ed. 335, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 91, that 'the town and its inhabitants were certainly substantial entities in fact, and were recognized by Congress as having rights, and directed such rights to be authenticated by a patent of the United States.' To the second contention the obvious answer was that under  2964, supra, then in force, service by publication could have been made, 'since in that event the defendant 'was so situated that process could not otherwise be served upon it.\"\n We have quoted thus at length from the opinion of the supreme court because necessarily the contention of appellants that the town was properly impleaded and properly served under the designation of 'unknown claimants of interests' depends upon the local statutes, to the construction of which by the supreme court we have repeatedly decided we refer. In this case the deference is the more justified, if indeed it is not compelled, by the subsequent construction of the statutes in the same way by the supreme court of the state in Rodriguez v. La Cueva Ranch Co. 134 Pac. 228, in which case  3181 of the Compiled Laws of New Mexico was considered. By that section it is provided that in suits for partition all persons interested in the premises 'whose names are unknown may be made parties to such partition by the name and description of unknown owners or proprietors of the premises, or as unknown heirs of any person who may have been interested in the same.' Persons who were in actual possession had not been made parties by name, and the question was whether they were made parties under the designation of 'unknown owners.' The question was determined in the negative, the court holding 'that it was not the intention of the legislature to provide for the making of parties by the name of unknown owners, and for the service of process upon them by publication, when they in fact were in the open and notorious adverse possession of a part of the \n\n[232 U.S. 604, 615]\n\u00a0\n premises.' The court further said that the complainants in the suit had the means and it was their duty to ascertain the names of all persons actually holding adverse possession, and that it was not the intention of the legislature to allow the rights of claimants to land in such circumstances 'to be foreclosed of their rights by a proceeding in which they are not named, and in which the only service obtained upon them was by publication.' The court cited the decision in the case at bar in support of its conclusion, saying, after noting certain differences which strengthened that decision: 'In principle we can see no difference between the two cases. In that case the court was construing the statutes of the territory in regard to proceedings to quiet title, which are in substance and effect the same as the partition statute in regard to proceedings against unknown owners, and held that such statutes must be strictly construed, and that the decree in that case was unavailing as against the town of Las Vegas.' Other cases were cited, among them being American Land Co. v. Zeiss, \n219 U.S. 48\n, 55 L. ed. 83, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 200. It is not necessary to review them, as the construction of the court of the local statute is that it requires the parties defendant in an action to quiet title to be designated 'by their names, as near as they can be ascertained,' and permits parties defendant to be designated as 'unknown claimants' only when their names cannot be ascertained. In other words, requires them to be unknown in fact, not merely in designation. Any other conclusion would make the statute not a facility for removing clouds from titles, but for putting clouds upon them; and the accommodation of the law of its process to an exceptional condition could be perverted, and rights devested by a semblance of notice of adverse claims to them.\n It is contended, however, that the distinction which the supreme court of the territory made between the findings of the trial court in the proceedings of 1894, as to \n\n[232 U.S. 604, 616]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction, and findings as to other matters in issue, is without foundation, and that 'the question of the jurisdiction of the defendants through service by publication having been adjudicated in the decree of 1894' is conclusive, 'and not subject to attack in this collateral proceeding, whether as a matter of fact it was in issue or not.' To sustain the contention Thompson v. Thompson, \n226 U.S. 552\n, 57 L. ed. 348, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 129, is cited. The case was concerned with the faith and credit to be given to a decree of divorce rendered upon service by publication. The publication was attacked because based on an affidavit made on information and belief, and it was hence contended that the court had not acquired jurisdiction. The contention was held untenable, the court saying that if the affidavit could be regarded as defective, it was not in the omission to state a material fact, but in the degree of proof; and that therefore the resulting judgment could not be said to be void on its face. The principle was declared, however, to be established that the full faith and credit clause and the statute enacted thereunder do not apply to judgments rendered by a court having no jurisdiction of the parties or subject-matter, or of the res in proceedings in rem.\n The case at bar is therefore clearly distinct from that case. The town of Las Vegas at the time of the institution of the suit to quiet title and of the publication of process was, whether regarded as an entity separate from its inhabitants, or collectively, as composed of them, either not intended to be made a party under the designation 'unknown claimants of interest,' or the designation was untrue.\n But it is further contended that service by publication was not an issue in this case, the pleadings and the decision of the trial court being based upon the view 'that the status of the town was such that no rights by limitation could be adjudicated against it, because of the impossibility of serving it with legal process' and that the supreme court having found against appellants on that \n\n[232 U.S. 604, 617]\n\u00a0\n contention, there was nothing left but to reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the cause, with instructions to grant the writ prayed for. The supreme court could not, it was further contended, go outside of the record, and of its own motion raise the issue as to the sufficiency of the service upon the defendants, that issue being in express language excluded by appellees from the court's consideration. The answer is immediate. We know of no rule which precludes an appellate court deciding a case for other reasons than those expressed by the trial court, and the contention that the sufficiency of the service was withdrawn from the consideration of the court by appellees is not justified. It is based upon the averment of the town that neither at the time of the confirmation of the grant nor at any time subsequent thereto did it have a representative upon whom legal process could have been served, until the 9th of December, 1902, when the board of trustees was appointed.\n The supreme court dealt with the fact, and, as we have seen, ascribed a different effect to it than that ascribed by the trial court. The supreme court said, there being no officer of the town upon whom process could have been served, service by publication could have been made, 'since in that event the defendant 'was so situated that process could not otherwise be served upon it.\" But the court was of the view, as we have seen, that such fact did not authorize the town to be made defendant under the name of 'unknown claimants,' or cited as such by publication, and the town having been so named, the decree of 1894 was not binding upon it.\n The next contention of appellants is that the inhabitants of the town and appellees are privies in estate, and are bound by the decree quieting title. In other words, that there was such identity of interest between the defendants in the suit to quiet title and the present appellees, the board of trustees, that the latter is bound by the decree. \n\n[232 U.S. 604, 618]\n\u00a0\n The argument is that the town was the mere representative of the inhabitants, and that the nonappointment of someone to represent it 'cannot operate to suspend either the institution or prosecution of legal proceedings against the trust estate, or to discharge either the trust estate or the beneficiaries from the effect of the judgment rendered, when the latter have been made parties and served with legal process.' In other words, if we understand the contention, it is that the proceedings of 1894, being against some of the inhabitants of the town, bind all of the other inhabitants, considered as an entity or collectively. We need not pause to consider the soundness of the countention. If justified at all, it would seem to make necessary the present petition. It puts out of view besides the effect of the confirmation to the town. We said, in Maese v. Herman, \n183 U.S. 572\n, 46 L. ed. 335, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 91: 'The town and its inhabitants were certainly substantial entities in fact, and were recognized by Congress as having rights, and directed such rights to be authenticated by a patent of the United States.' The town was the confirmee and represented, it may be, individual interests, but collective interests as well. It was because of the grant to the town that the act of March 12, 1903, supra, was enacted, giving the district court of San Miguel county, 'jurisdiction to manage, control, and administer' the grant. It was in the execution of this jurisdiction that the appellees, trustees, of the town, were appointed and goven the power to make conveyances to individuals if they had the character of title described.\n But the town also had rights, and, as we have seen, by  9 of the act of March 12, 1903, the trustees were given power 'to lease, sell, or mortgage any part or parts of the grant.' See, as to rights which towns had under the Mexican law, United States v. Pico, 5 Wall. 536, 18 L. ed. 695; Townsend v. Greeley, 5 Wall. 326, 18 L. ed. 547; United States v. Santa F e, \n165 U.S. 675\n, 41 L. ed. 874, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 472.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","178":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPRONOVOST v.

Upon the trial, the jury found the defendant guilty, and a judgment of conviction followed, to reverse which he sued out this direct writ of error. No brief or argument has been submitted in his behalf, and the grounds upon which he seeks a reversal are not made clear.\n It appears that the jurisdiction of the district court was challenged upon some ground, not disclosed in the record, and that the objection was overruled. The indictment is in the usual form, gives January 2, 1911, as the date of the offense, describes the liquors as consisting of designated quantities of whisky, wine, and beer, and charges that they were introduced by the defendant into the Flathead Indian Reservation, in the state of Montana, the same 'then and there being an Indian country.' A brief bill of exceptions recites that the government produced evidence in support of the charge, and that the defendant admitted the introduction of the liquors 'as charged in the indictment.' Nothing more appears respecting what was shown at the trial.\n An act of Congress makes the introduction of liquors, such as whisky, wine, and beer, into the Indian country, an offense against the United States, and prescribes its punishment. 29 Stat. at L. 506, chap. 109. \n\n[232 U.S. 487, 489]\n\u00a0\n This act embraces Indian country within the limits of a state.

An Indian reservation is Indian country (Clairmont v. United States, \n225 U.S. 551\n, 56 L. ed. 1201, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 787), and we take judicial notice that on the date named there was an Indian reservation in the state of Montana known as the Flathead Indian Reservation. Treaty of July 16, 1855, 12 Stat. at L. 975, art. 2; acts April 23, 1904, 33 Stat. at L. 302, chap. 1495,  12, and March 3, 1905, 33 Stat. at L. 1048, 1080, chap. 1479,  9; Rep. Com. Ind. Affairs, 1911, p. 83. Subject to exceptions not here material, the jurisdiction of the district court, as prescribed by law, embraced all offenses against the United States committed within the state of Montana. Rev. Stat.  563, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 455; 25 Stat. at L. 676, 682, chap. 180,  21.\n Thus we see not only that the grounds upon which the court's jurisdiction was challenged are not disclosed by the record, but also that, so far as appears, the offense charged in the indictment and shown at the trial was manifestly cognizable in the district court.\n The bill of exceptions contains a further recital that the defendant, at the conclusion of the evidence, requested the court to direct a verdict of acquittal upon the ground that the town of Polson was incorporated under the laws of Montana and subject to the state's police power, and that the subject-matter of the case was not within the control of the United States. In this there may have been an indirect assertion that the liquors were introduced into the town of Polson, not into the Flathead Indian Reservation, and that the offense, if any, was not one against the United States. But, even if so, the assertion has no other support in the record. The indictment makes no mention of the town of Polson, and neither does the recital respecting what was shown at the trial. The latter, as we have seen, states that the government pro- \n\n[232 U.S. 487, 490]\n\u00a0\n duced evidence in support of the charge, and that the defendant admitted the introduction of the liquor 'as charged in the indictment.' The natural import of this is that the liquors were introduced into the Flathead Indian Reservation. In this situation the reference to the town of Polson cannot be regarded as a factor in the case. But, as bearing upon the possible status of the lands occupied by the town, see Perrin v. United States, \n232 U.S. 478\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 387; 34 Stat. at L. 354, chap. 3504,  17; 35 Stat. at L. 795, chap. 263,  21.\n As no real question of the District Court's jurisdiction is involved, nor any constitutional or treaty question, there is no basis for the direct writ of error.

Hartridge for appellant.\n Mr. Thomas F. West, Attorney General for Florida, for appellee.\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 23, 25]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n These are suits to prevent the collection of a tax on gross receipts for different years, derived from business done by the appellant in the state of Florida, and to have the laws under which the tax would be assessed declared contrary to the 14th Amendment. The bills are like those stated in \n231 U.S. 571\n, 58 L. ed. 375, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 182, and aver the following facts: Chapter 5597 of the Laws of Florida for 1907, now  44 of chapter 6421 of the Laws of 1913, imposes a license tax, which has been paid. Section 46 of chapter 5596 of the Laws of 1907, imposes a tax ad valorem, which also has been paid, with immaterial exceptions. Up to 1907 this property tax had not existed, but sleeping and parlor car companies had been required to make a return of gross receipts from business done between points within the state, and to pay a percentage upon such returns, which it paid in lieu of all other taxes. But by  47 of said chapter 5596 ( now  45 of chapter 6421 of the Laws of 1913), the last-mentioned tax was continued in force alongside of the new ad valorem tax of  46, and the appellant contends that after the levying of a property tax the tax on gross returns became void. An application for a preliminary injunction was heard before three judges and was denied, whereupon this appeal was taken and a supersedeas was granted upon payment of the sum in dispute into court.\n The cases come here upon an alleged infringement of the Constitution of the United States, but are argued mainly upon the Constitution of the state. Of course the latter is not taken up into the 14th Amendment. Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 U.S. 674\n, 42 L. ed. 622, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 229; Burt v. Smith, \n203 \nU.S. 129, 135\n, 51 S. L. ed. 121, 126, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 37. It can be considered only because the cases come from the district court upon the other ground. We will deal with the Federal question first. It is suggested that there is an arbitrary classifica- \n\n[235 U.S. 23, 26]\n\u00a0\n tion because the tax is confined to sleeping and parlor car companies, and does not fall upon railroads operating their own sleeping and parlor cars. If otherwise this were a valid objection, as to which we need express no opinion, it is enough to say that a tax is not to be upset upon hypothetical and unreal possibilities, if it would be good upon the facts as they are. Keokee Consol. Coke Co. v. Taylor, \n234 U.S. 224\n, 58 L. ed. 1288, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 856. It does not appear that any railroad in Florida does operate its own sleeping or parlor cars, and the attorney general of the state denies that such a case exists.\n The other objection urged is that the taxpayer is not given a hearing. The statute, as we have said, requires the companies to make a report and fixes a percentage ($1.50 per $100) to be paid. If the report is not made, the comptroller is to estimate the gross receipts and add 10 per cent of the amount of the taxes as a penalty. If the companies do as required there is nothing to be heard about. They fix the amount and the statute establishes the proportionto be paid over. Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 U.S. 232\n, 33 L. ed. 892, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 533. The provision in case of their failure to report is not, as it seemed to be suggested in argument, an alternative left open for the companies to choose. It is a provision for their failure to do their duty. In that event their chance and right to be heard have gone by.\n We do not feel called upon to discuss the objections under the Constitution of the state at length. Starting with the conceded proposition that the tax, to be valid, must be either ad valorem or a license tax, the appellant argues that this cannot be a license tax, as was held by the judges who refused the injunction, because the payment of it is not made a condition of the right to do business; because another tax is imposed in terms for a license; and because the history of the law shows that for years it took the place of a property tax. These considerations \n\n[235 U.S. 23, 27]\n\u00a0\n undoubtedly are very strong. But as we are dealing with the validity of the law under the state Constitution, a matter that must be decided finally by the state court, and as the state court has held other gross earning taxes to be license taxes (Afro-American Industrial & Benefit Asso. v. State, 61 Fla. 85, 89, 54 So. 383), we are of opinion that if this act is to be overthrown, it should not be overthrown by us. It is true that there are possible distinctions between this case and the Florida decision cited, but it seems to us not improbable that the supreme court had in view a principle broad enough to cover the case at bar.

MYERS(1914)\nNo. 251\nArgued: Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n Mr. Thomas A. E. Weadock for plaintiff in error.[ Radford v. Myers \n231 U.S. 725\n (1914) ]\n\n\n[231 U.S. 725, 727]\n\u00a0\n No appearance for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n Elijah E. Myers brought this suit in the circuit court of Wayne county, state of Michigan, against George W. Radford, the plaintiff in error herein, for an accounting and for a decree for the balance due him from a judgment in a suit of the former in which the latter acted as one of his attorneys and received the amount of the judgment. Myers having died during the pendency of the action, it was revived in the name of his executrix, the defendant in error. The decree of the circuit court in favor of the \n\n[231 U.S. 725, 728]\n\u00a0\n defendant in error was affirmed by the supreme court of the state of Michigan (167 Mich. 135, 132 N. W. 550, and the case comes here on error.\n The record discloses that Myers had entered into a contract with the county of Luzerne, state of Pennsylvania, to furnish the plans and specifications for a courthouse, and had certain claims against the county arising therefrom. Counsel had been employed and suit commenced, but little progress made. Myers had assigned a one-half interest in the contract to his son, George W. Myers. In this state of affairs the elder Myers employed the plaintiff in error, who had theretofore been his attorney, and to whom he was indebted, to prosecute the courthouse claim. To secure his indebtedness to Radford, Myers assigned his remaining one- half interest in the claim to the plaintiff in error. Later, April 2, 1900, George W. Myers assigned his one-half interest to the plaintiff in error, the latter to account to him for the proceeds after deducting a $1,000 attorney's fee and one half of the costs, to which assignment Elijah E. Myers gave his written assent; and shortly thereafter, April 11, 1900, George W. Myers, in consideration of $150, transferred his interest in his prior assignment and in the assignment from his father to him to the plaintiff in error.\n The plaintiff in error engaged local counsel in Pennsylvania, who commenced suit in the United States circuit court for the middle district of Pennsylvania, and prosecuted the courthouse claim to a successful termination (Myers v. Luzerne County, 124 Fed. 436). Thereupon George W. Myers intervened in that suit, setting up his right to one half of the judgment, claiming that his assignment to Radford had been fraudulently obtained; and one half of the amount of the judgment was paid into court. Upon the petition of the plaintiff in error to remove the money, the jurat of which was signed by Elijah E. Myers, the court decreed that the \n\n[231 U.S. 725, 729]\n\u00a0\n assignment was valid, and awarded the fund to Radford, and dismissed George W. Myers's claim.\n Elijah E. Myers thereafter brought this suit, alleging, among other things, that Radford, on April 11, 1900, acting on his behalf, purchased the one-half interest assigned by him to George W. Myers, and that at that time it was distinctly understood and agreed between the plaintiff in error and himself that the one-half interest so purchased, with the one- half interest assigned by him to Radford, should be held as security for the payment of all his indebtedness to Radford for loans and services, and for the payment of the $150 given by Radford to George W. Myers, and all costs in the litigation of the courthouse claim, and that, after deducting such amounts from the judgment collected, the plaintiff in error should pay the balance to him. The plaintiff in error contended that the judgment in the United States circuit court was res judicata as to his right to the one-half interest in the courthouse claim assigned to him by George W. Myers. He further alleged, however, that, notwithstanding his absolute ownership of the George W. Myers one-half interest, he purchased it with the distinct intention that he would apply for the benefit of Elijah E. Myers the balance, if he succeeded in collecting the claim, after paying expenses and services and all Myers's indebtedness to him. But, he alleged, he did not intend to waive his right as absolute owner, or allow Myers to dictate the amount of expenses, services, or indebtedness. The circuit court entered a decree for the balance due Myers.\n The supreme court held that the assignment of April 2, 1900, was merged in the assignment of April 11, 1900, and also held that the Federal decision in Pennsylvania had not determined that the trust relation between the plaintiff in error and Elijah E. Myers had terminated; as to which holdings the plaintiff in error assigns error, upon the failure of the supreme court to give due credit in those \n\n[231 U.S. 725, 730]\n\u00a0\n respects to the judgment of the United States circuit court.\n From the foregoing statement it is evident that the sole Federal question involved arises from the alleged denial in the judgment of the supreme court of Michigan of due effect to the judgment rendered in the United States circuit court in Pennsylvania, which is relied upon by the plaintiff in error as re judicata of the matters in controversy. Whether such effect was given as the former judgment required presents a Federal question for determination. National Foundry & Pipe Works v. Oconto Water Supply Co. \n183 \nU.S. 216, 233\n, 46 S.

To determine this issue we examine the judgment in the former case, the pleadings filed and the issues made, and, if necessary to elucidate the matters decided, the opinion of the court which rendered the judgment. National Foundry & Pipe Works v. Oconto Water Supply Co. supra, 234, and previous cases in this court therein cited.\n As the suit in the Michigan court was not upon the identical cause of action litigated in the United States circuit court, the estoppel operates only as to matters in issue or points controverted and actually decided in that suit.

Co. \n227 \nU.S. 434, 440\n, 57 S. L. ed. 586, 589, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 274.\n Applying these familiar principles, how stands the present case? The elder Myers brought this suit upon the theory that the amount of the judgment which had been paid over to Radford on August 22, 1903, which the supreme court of Michigan found was $12,711.23, was held in trust and to be accounted for by Radford to him because of the agreement set up in the complaint in the state court, already referred to. The record of the proceedings in the United States circuit court shows that one half of the money due upon the claim of Elijah E. Myers against Luzerne county had been paid into court in the original suit of Myers against Luzerne county. \n\n[231 U.S. 725, 731]\n\u00a0\n Radford had filed a petition asking for the payment of the money to him as the owner of the judgment. George W. Myers, as respondent, filed an answer, claiming the amount in court, and attacking his assignment to Radford. It was upon that petition and answer and testimony that the case was heard and the following order made:\n'In the United States Circuit Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania,\n\n'February Term, 1903\n\n\n\n'No. 3.\n\n'Elijah E. Myers \nv.\n 'County of Luzerne.\n\n'In the Matter of Petition of George W. Radford to Take Money Out of Court.\n\n'At a Session of said Court Hold at Scranton, in said district, on the 31st Day of July, One Thousand Nine Hundred and Three.\n\n'Present: Honorable R. W. Archbald, District Judge.\n\n'The above matter having heretofore been heard upon said petition, answers, and proofs, and the same having been argued by counsel for petitioner, as well as for the respondent, respectively, and due consideration had thereon, it is now ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the assignment from respondent to petitioner of the 11th day of April, one thousand nine hundred, is valid, and an absolute assignment of all the interest of said respondent in the said contract between Elijah E. Myers and the county commissioners of Luzerne county of date February 22, 1895, and that the fund in court be awarded to petitioner, George W. Radford; and that the claim of George W. Myers, respondent, be dismissed, with costs to be taxed against said respondent.'\n\n A reading of this order, which is said to embody the Federal judgment relied upon by the plaintiff in error as res judicata of the present controversy, shows that the only matter adjudged concerned the assignment from the \n\n[231 U.S. 725, 732]\n\u00a0\n respondent (George W. Myers) to the petitioner (Radford), of date the 11th day of April, 1900, the court holding that it was an absolute assignment of the interest of the respondent in the contract between Elijah E. Myers and the county of Luzerne, awarding the fund in court (which was one half of that recovery) to the petitioner, and decreeing that the claim of the respondent be dismissed and that he pay all the costs. Certainly there is nothing in that judgment to conclude the present suit in the state court between Elijah E. Myers and Radford. The proceeding in the United States circuit court in Pennsylvania is specifically limited to the controversy between Radford and the respondent in that proceeding, George W. Myers. If there could be any doubt as to the effect of the order, the opinion of Judge Archbald, found in the record, shows how the matter was regarded by him. The opinion recites that, a verdict having been rendered in favor of Elijah E. Myers, because of a controversy with respect to one half of it, leave of court had been given to pay one half of the judgment into court, and that the petitioner, Radford, and George W. Myers, by each of whom ownership was asserted, by pleadings and proof, had submitted the matter to that court, and that it had jurisdiction to determine to whom the fund belonged. After referring to the original contract and the various steps to collect the money from the county of Luzerne and the assignment of a one-half interest from the elder Myers to his son in 1896, Judge Archbald said:\n'Col. Myers explained to Mr. Radford that one half the contract had already been assigned to George, and it was recognized that if he held on to the assignment there would be little, if anything, coming to Col. Myers after he had settled with Radford. But it was stated by Col. Myers that the assignment was without consideration, and if he succeeded, as he hoped, in getting George to surrender it, then Radford was to account to him for that \n\n[231 U.S. 725, 733]\n\u00a0\n interest also, after deducting for expenses and services. The trust relation so established still continues.'\n\n The opinion then goes on to consider elaborately the claim of George W. Myers to the one-half interest paid into court, as against Radford, and finds that the assignment of April 11, 1900, was a valid sale from George W. Myers to Radford, and that the assignment was absolute in form, and intended by George W. Myers as a complete disposition to Radford for $150 of the one-half interest derived from his father. The judge concludes his opinion by directing that an order be drawn, awarding the fund to Radford, and dismissing the claim of George W. Myers, with costs. Thereupon the order which we have already set forth was made.\n The fact that the order was made in an intervention in the original suit of Myers v. Luzerne County, and that Myers verified the petition filed by Radford, asking to have the fund in court paid over to the latter, did not raise any issue between Elijah E. Myers and Radford as to the alleged agreement that Radford should account to Myers for the fund. And the fact that both Elijah E. Myers and Radford were parties in the same suit did not have the effect to submit the controversy made in the present litigation to the decision of the United States circuit court. Judgments become estoppels because they affect matters upon which the parties have been heard or have had an opportunity to be heard, but are not conclusive upon matters not in question or immaterial. Reynolds v. Stockton, \n140 \nU.S. 254, 268\n, 269 S., 35 L. ed. 464, 468, 469, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 773.\n It seems very clear that there was nothing in this proceeding, in the issues made or the judgment rendered, that in any wise concluded the right of Elijah E. Myers to bring suit, which he subsequently prosecuted in the state court, calling upon Radford for an accounting concerning the proceeds of the judgment in his hands.\n Judgment of the Supreme Court of Michigan affirmed. \n\n\n\n","181":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAINEY v. U S(1914)\nNo. 74\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1914\n\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 310, 312]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. Andrade, Jr., for Roy A. Rainey. \n\n[232 U.S. 310, 313]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Adkins and Mr. Karl W. Kirchwey for the United States.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The first two of the foregoing cases relate to a tax becoming due on the 1st of September, 1909, and the other two to a tax becoming due on the 1st of September, 1910, the taxes in all cases having been levied, pursuant to  37 of the tariff act of 1909 [36 Stat. at L. 112, chap. 6. U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1197], on the British built yacht Cassandra, owned by the plaintiff in error. In these cases, as in those arising under the same act, which we have just decided, the certificates of the circuit court of appeals are here because of writs of error from that court prosecuted by the United States for the purpose of reviewing the action of the trial court in rejecting a demand for interest, and the two other cases are here on direct writ of error to the court below, to review its action in upholding the tax. In both the cases brought directly here, the pleadings of the government asserted the citizenship of the defendant, the use of the yacht during the taxing period, and the other statutory \n\n[232 U.S. 310, 314]\n\u00a0\n essentials to fix liability. The answers not traversing citizenship, ownership, or use, set up the same defenses as were urged in the cases we have just decided, somewhat however, reiterated and changed in form of statement, and other defenses not made in the previous cases. In the first direct case, judgment was rendered in favor of the government for the tax by submission on bill and answer. In the second a like judgment was rendered, the case having been submitted by stipulation to the court without a jury; and in that case the finding of fact made by the court as to the use of the yacht is as follows: 'During the period from the said 25th day of June, 1908, the date when the defendant purchased the said yacht, to the 1st day of September, 1910, the yacht was used by the defendant both in the waters of the United States and in the waters of foreign countries, as well as on the high seas; and in the year immediately preceding the first day of September, 1910, the said yacht was used by the defendant continuously in the waters of the United States, except for the period from June 20, 1910, to July 30, 1910, when she was used by the defendant on a cruise to the Gulf of St. Lawrence.'\n Separate assignments of error were made in the two cases which are here on direct review, and are referred to and discussed in the arguments at bar. They are all, in both cases, however, embraced in the ten separate propositions stated in the argument, and both cases will therefore be disposed of by briefly considering and deciding them. In doing so we shall bring the several assignments under common headings, for the purpose of avoiding repetition. First, that the court erred in holding there was authority to bring an action in personam against the owner for the recovery of the tax. This is disposed of by the reasoning adopted in the Billings Case [\n232 U.S. 261\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 421], in passing on the question of liability for interest. Second, that error was committed in holding the first instalment of \n\n[232 U.S. 310, 315]\n\u00a0\n the tax was due in September 1909, and in deciding that the six months' clause, under the section in question, 'applied only to the charterer, and did not apply to the owner of a foreign-built yacht.' Third, that error was committed in deciding that the tax did not violate the due process clause of the 5th Amendment, and was not in conflict with the uniformity clause of article 1,  8, of the Constitution. These grounds also are disposed of by the opinion in the Billings Case. Fourth, that error was committed in not deciding that  37 of the act of 1909, 'in so far as it lays a duty of 35 per cent ad valorem, is a direct tax and void because not apportioned, in contravention of article 1,  2, and article 1,  9, of the Constitution of the United States.' This proposition is concerned with the second paragraph of the act in question, which gives a right to the owner of foreign-built yachts to commutation, as follows:\n'In lieu of the annual tax above prescribed the owner of any foreign- built yacht, pleasure boat, or vessel above described may pay a duty of thirty-five per centum ad valorem thereon, and such yacht, pleasure boat or vessel shall thereupon be entitled to all the privileges and shall be subject to all the requirements prescribed by sections forty-two hundred and fourteen, forty-two hundred and fifteen, forty-two hundred and seventeen, and forty-two hundred and eighteen of the Revised Statutes U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2845-2847, and act amendatory thereto, in the same manner as if said yacht had been built in the United States, and shall be subject to tonnage duty and light money only in the same manner as if said yacht had been built in the United States.'\n\n We think the reasons given in the comprehensive opinion of the lower court in ruling adversely on this proposition are so conclusive that we adopt them and make them our own. The court said:\n'The owner is not required to pay this duty. He is merely given the option to pay it. In its nature it would \n\n[232 U.S. 310, 316]\n\u00a0\n seem to be a duty on imports, and such duties are not held to be direct taxes requiring apportionment. But it is unnecessary to pass upon this question. These actions are for the recovery of the annual tonnage tax, and the validity of the ad valorem tax is not involved. The provisions concerning that tax are separable from those concerning the annual tax. The one is not dependent upon the other, and there is no indication that Congress would not have adopted the one without the other. Under such conditions it is well settled that unconstitutional provisions may be separated from legal provisions and effect be given to the latter.' [190 Fed. 362.]\n\n Fifth, that error was committed in not holding that enforcement of the tax 'would destroy rights vested in the defendant under the British treaty of July 3d, 1815 [8 Stat. at L. 228],' and would for such reason 'deprive the defendant of his property without due process of law.' The court below adequately disposed of this contention upon reasons which we also approve and adopt.\n The court said:\n'The defendant does not claim to be a British subject, and it is by no means clear that he is entitled to invoke the protection of the treaty. But, however that may be, it is well settled that when a treaty is inconsistent with a subsequent act of Congress, the latter will prevail. Taylor v. Morton, 2 Curt. C. C. 454, Fed. Cas. No. 13,799; and see Whitney v. Robertson, \n124 U.S. 190\n, 31 L. ed. 386, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 456; Head Money Cases (Edye v. Robertson), \n112 U.S. 580\n, 28 L. ed. 798, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 247; Cherokee Tobacco (Boudinot v. United States), 11 Wall. 616, 20 L. ed. 227; Ropes v. Clinch. 8 Blatchf. 304, Fed. Cas. No. 12,041.\n\n'Treaties are contracts between nations, and by the Constitution are made the law of the land. But the Constitution does not declare that the law so established shall never be altered or repealed by Congress. Good faith toward the other contracting nation might require Congress to refrain from making any change, but if it does act, its enactment becomes the controlling law in this country. The other nation may have ground for complaint, but \n\n[232 U.S. 310, 317]\n\u00a0\n every person is bound to obey the law. And as a corollary it follows that no person acquires any vested right to the continued operation of a treaty.'\n\n Sixth, that error was committed in not deciding that  37 of the act was void, 'as it is a bill for raising revenue, and it originated in the Senate and not in the House of Representatives, in contravention to article 1,  7, of the Constitution of the United States.' Without intimating that there is judicial power, after an act of Congress has been duly promulgated, to inquire in which House it originated, for the purpose of determining its validity, and upon the assumption, for the sake of the argument, that such power may be invoked, again we think the court below disposed of the contention upon a ground entirely satisfactory, which we adopt and approve, the court saying:\n'I am also satisfied that the section in question is not void as a bill for raising revenue originating in the Senate, and not in the House of Representatives. It appears that the section was proposed by the Senate as an amendment to a bill for raising revenue which originated in the House. That is sufficient. Having become an enrolled and duly authenticated act of Congress, it is not for this court to determine whether the amendment was or was not outside the purposes of the original bill.'\n\n Following the practice adopted in the cases previously decided, and treating, as we did in these cases, the United States as here on a cross writ of error complaining of the refusal to allow interest, it follows that the questions asked by the circuit court of appeals, covered by the certificates, need not be answered, and that the judgments of the court below in the cases on direct writ of error in so far as they rejected the claim of interest will be modified to the extent necessary to allow such claim, and in other respects will be affirmed. Therefore the order will be modified and affirmed. \n\n\n\n","182":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAINEY v. W.R. GRACE & CO.(1914)\nNo. 119\nArgued: Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[231 U.S. 703, 704]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William H. Gorham for Mary F. Rainey\n No appearance for W. R. Grace & Company.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case is here on certificate from the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit. The facts stated show that the appellant caused fifty or more copies of the apostles on appeal in an admiralty case to be printed under the 1st section of the act of Congress of February 13, 1911 ( 36 Stat. at L. 901, chap. 47, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 275). The appeal was taken from the district court of the United States for the western district of Washington, and the copies of the apostles were printed and indexed under a rule of that court adopted June 13, 1911, in pursuance of the act of February 13, 1911. In due time the appellant filed one of the printed copies, certified by the clerk, and under the seal of the court below, in the circuit court of appeals, and moved that court to here the case without the payment by the appellant of the fees of the clerk of the circuit court of appeals for indexing the record, as prescribed by  9 of rule 23 of that court, and without the payment by the appellant of the fees of the clerk for indexing the record and distributing copies, as provided in that section. Section 9 provides:\n'In all cases, including cases in which the record may have been printed under the act of Congress approved \n\n[231 U.S. 703, 705]\n\u00a0\n February 13, 1911, or otherwise, the fee of the clerk of this court for performing the services herein required shall be twenty-five cents for each printed page of the record and index, as provided by law.'\n\n On this statement the circuit court of appeals certifies to this court two questions, namely:\n'1. When the appellant in a cause in admiralty causes to be printed and presented to this court under said act of February 13, 1911, printed copies of the apostles on appeal, each of which copies contains a printed index of the contents thereof, and is prepared and printed under a rule of the lower court adopted in pursuance of said act, is this court authorized to hear and determine the cause on such copies, and to dispense with the requirement of the payment of fees to the clerk of this court by the appellant, as prescribed by  9 of rule 23 of this court, which is the fee bill prescribed on February 28, 1898, by the Supreme Court under the act of Congress of February 19, 1897 (29 Stat. at L. 536, chap. 263, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 557), which provides as a fee for 'preparing the record for the printer, indexing the same, supervising the printing and distributing the copies, for each printed page of the record and index, twenty-five cents'?\n\n'2. Does the 1st section of the act of Congress of February 13, 1911 ( 36 Stat. at L. 901, chap. 47, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 275), set aside by implication said fee bill so prescribed by the Supreme Court, which is referred to in the first question herein certified?'\n\n The answer to these question requires a construction of the act of Congress of February 13, 1911, which is, in part, as follows:\n'That in any cause or proceeding wherein the final judgment or decree is sought to be reviewed on appeal to, or by writ of error from, a United States circuit court of appeals, the appellant or plaintiff in error shall cause to be printed under such rules as the lower court shall prescribe, and shall file in the office of the clerk of such circuit \n\n[231 U.S. 703, 706]\n\u00a0\n court of appeals at least twenty days before the case is called for argument therein, at least twenty-five printed transcripts of the record of the lower court, and of such part or abstract of the proofs as the rules of such circuit court of appeals may require, and in such form as the Supreme Court of the United States shall by rule prescribe, one of which printed transcripts shall be certified under the hand of the clerk of the lower court and under the seal thereof, and shall furnish three copies of such printed transcript to the adverse party at least twenty days before such argument: Provided, That either the court below or the circuit court of appeals may order any original document or other evidence to be sent up in addition to the printed copies of the record, or in lieu of printed copies of a part thereof; and no written or typewritten transcript of the record shall be required.'\n\n And a construction of the act requires a consideration of prior statutes on the subject. On February 19, 1897 (29 Stat. at L. 536, chap. 263, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 557, Congress passed an act amending the circuit court of appeals act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 547), providing:\n\"The costs and fees in each circuit court of appeals shall be fixed and established by said court in a table of fees, to be adopted within three months after the passage of this act: Provided, That the costs and fees so fixed by any court of appeals shall not, with respect to any item, exceed the costs and fees now charged in the Supreme Court.' Each circuit court of appeals shall, within three months after the fixing and establishing of costs and fees as aforesaid, transmit said table to the Chief Justice of the United States, and within one year thereof the Supreme Court of the United States shall revise said table, making the same, so far as may seem just and reasonable, uniform throughout the United States. The table of fees, when so revised, shall thereupon be in force for each circuit.' \n\n[231 U.S. 703, 707]\n\u00a0\n On February 28, 1898, this court, by order, fixed a table of fees and costs in the circuit courts of appeals, one paragraph providing:\n\n\"Preparing the record for the printer, indexing the same, supervising the printing and distributing the copies, for each printed page of the record and index $0.25\"\n\n This is the charge provided for in rule 23 of the circuit court of appeals referred to in the certificate.\n Before the passage of the act of February 13, 1911, the clerks of the district and circuit courts charged for a transcript of the record in preparing the case for review in the circuit court of appeals, which transcript was usually written or typewritten, and not required to be printed, the fee for such service being fixed ( 828, Rev. Stat. U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 635). The printing was done under the supervision of the clerk of the circuit court of appeals after the allowance of appeal or writ of error under the regulations above set forth.\n In this state of the law, Congess came to deal with the subject in the act of February 13, 1911. The act is entitled: 'An Act to Diminish the Expense of Proceedings on Appeal and Writ of Error or of Certiorari;' and especially when read in the light of the report of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the House, which accompanied its introduction into that body, shows that its main purpose is to reduce the expense of records upon which cases may be taken to and considered in the circuit courts of appeals and this court. This was to be accomplished by dispensing with a written or typewritten transcript of the record of the lower court, and substituting therefor a certified copy of the printed record, other copies of which should be available for use in the further consideration of the case in the appellate courts. With these ends in view the act provides that the appellant or plaintiff in error shall cause to be printed under such rules as the lower court (the circuit or district court) shall pre- \n\n[231 U.S. 703, 708]\n\u00a0\n scribe, and shall file in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of appeals, twenty-five printed transcripts of the record. The form in which the transcript shall be printed, the act provides, shall be prescribed by this court, which, on March 13, 1911, made the following order:\n'It is ordered by the court that the provisions of rule 31 of the rules of this court shall apply to all records to be printed as provided in the act of Congress entitled, 'An Act to Diminish the Expense of Proceedings on Appeal and Writ of Error or of Certiorari,' approved February 13, 1911.' Rule 31 prescribes:\n\n'All records, arguments, and briefs, printed for the use of the court, must be in such form and size that they can be conveniently bound together, so as to make an ordinary octavo volume; and, as well as all quotations contained therein, and the covers thereof, must be printed in clear type ( never smaller than small pica) and on unglazed paper.'\n\n Section 2 of the act provides for the use of such printed transcripts of the record, should the case be taken from the circuit court of appeals to this court. The evident purpose of the act is therefore, among other things, to save expenses incurred under the former system in printing records, the clerks' fees for supervising, etc.\n In view of this history of the legislation and its manifest purposes we think that, when the court below by its rule had, as in the present case, provided for the printing and indexing of the record, which had been done, and the printed transcript had been filed under the statute with the clerk of the circuit court of appeals, no fee for the like service can be charged by the clerk of the circuit court of appeals. To permit this would be subversive of the purposes of the statute and a continuance of the system which the act was designed to change.\n It is true that there is no express repeal of the act of \n\n[231 U.S. 703, 709]\n\u00a0\n February 19, 1897, granting authority to this court to fix the fees in the circuit courts of appeals, under which the rule referred to in the certificate was adopted, and under which it is contended by the clerk of the circuit court of appeals he is entitled to a fee for indexing, etc., and under which rule, if the clerk performs any of the services designated, he is entitled to the entire fee (Bean v. Patterson, \n110 U.S. 401\n, 28 L. ed. 190, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 23). It is equally true that repeals by implication are not favored, and that it is only in cases of clear inconsistency that a later act will be held to repeal a former one on the same subject. We think that in the present case clear inconsistency exists, and that the rule invoked in the certificate of the circuit court of appeals cannot stand consistently with the act of Congress of February 13, 1911, on the same subject. See King v. Cornell, \n106 U.S. 395\n, 27 L. ed. 60, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 312.\n It may also be true that the supervision by clerks of the circuit courts of appeals will tend to uniformity of printing, better indexing, and consequent greater facility in hearing cases upon appeal and writ of error. But Congress, with full authority, has regulated the matter, and it is the duty of the courts to enforce the legislation with a view to effecting the purposes for which it was enacted.\n We are therefore of the opinion that the later act, that of February 13, 1911, repeals the table of fees as to the fees of the clerk of the circuit court of appeals in the case mentioned under the facts certified. It follows that the first question certified by the Circuit Court of Appeals must be answered in the affirmative, and the second question also in the affirmative so far as the fee in question to the clerk of the Circuit Court of Appeals is involved.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","183":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRICHARDS v. WASHINGTON TERMINAL CO(1914)\nNo. 52\nArgued: November 7, 1913Decided: May 4, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 546, 547]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Hugh H. Obear, Charles A. Douglas, Thomas Ruffin, Edward F. Colladay, Paul Sleman, and Harry F. Lerch for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. John W. Yerkes, John J. Hamilton, and George E. Hamilton for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 546, 548]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n Plaintiff in error, who was plaintiff below, commenced this action in the supreme court of the District of Columbia to recover for the damage to his property resulting from the maintenance of an alleged nuisance by defendant by means of the operation of a railroad and tunnel upon its own lands near to, but not adjoining, those of plaintiff. Defendant having pleaded not guilty, the issue came on for trial by jury, and at the conclusion of plaintiff's evidence a verdict was directed in favor of defendant. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment (37 App. D. C. 289), and a writ of error brings the controversy under the review of this court.\n An agreed abridgment of the evidence upon which the ruling of the trial justice was based is embodied in the bill of exceptions. From this it appears that plaintiff is and has been since the year 1901 the owner of lot 34 in square 693 in the city of Washington, having a frontage of 20 ft. upon the westerly side of New Jersey avenue, southeast, and an average depth of 81 ft., with improvements thereon consisting of a three-story and basement brick dwelling house containing ten rooms, known as No. 415 New Jersey avenue. The rear windows upon all the floors of the house open in the direction of the railroad tracks that lead from defendant's tunnel. The south portal of this tunnel opens within square 693, and near its \n\n[233 U.S. 546, 549]\n\u00a0\n northeasterly corner, and the tunnel extends thence in a northeasterly direction, passing under the Capitol and Library grounds and First street N. E., to the Union Station at Massachusetts avenue. There are two sets of railroad tracks in the tunnel and leading from it, and as these emerge from the south portal they extend in a general southwesterly direction up an incline or grade across the central portion or square 693 on to an elevated structure which carries the tracks over and beyond South Capitol street. The tunnel and these tracks are used for the passage of trains running both northwardly and southwardly, about thirty each day, all of them being passenger trains with the exception of an occasional shifting engine. The trains frequently pass in and out of the tunnel without stopping, but trains also very often stop at or near a switch tower that is situate near the center of square 693. From the nearest portion of plaintiff's house to the center of the south portal, the distance in a straight line is about 114 ft., there being three intervening dwelling houses, two of which have been purchased and are now owned by defendant. From the rear end of plaintiff's lot to the middle of the tracks southwestwardly from the portal the distance in a straight line is about 90 ft. Plaintiff's property has been damaged by the volumes of dense black or gray smoke, and also by dust and dirt, cinders and gases, emitted from the trains while passing over the tracks and in or out of the tunnel, or standing upon the tracks near the signal tower. There is a fanning system installed in the tunnel which causes the gases and smoke emitted from engines while in the tunnel to be forced out of the south portal, and these gases and smoke contaminate the air, and also add to the inconvenience suffered by plaintiff in the occupation of his property. His house was pleasant and comfortable For purposes of occupation before the construction of the tunnel and tracks, but since then it has not only depreciated in value, but the tenant \n\n[233 U.S. 546, 550]\n\u00a0\n removed therefrom, and plaintiff was obliged to occupy the house himself by reason of his inability to rent it. The property has depreciated from a value of about $5,500 to about $4,000, and the rental value from $30 per month to $20 per month. The furniture and other belongings in the house have been depreciated from a value of $1,200 to $600, all of which depreciation is due to the presence of smoke, cinders, and gases emitted from passing trains and from the mouth of the tunnel, which smoke, cinders, and gases enter the dwelling house and settle upon the furniture and other personal property contained in it, contaminating the air and rendering the house objectionable as a habitation. The house has also been damaged by vibrations caused by the movement of trains on the track or in the tunnel, resulting in cracking the walls and wall paper, breaking glass in the windows, and disturbing the peace and slumber of the occupants.\n The defendant, the Washington Terminal Company, is the owner of the tunnel and of the tracks therein, but its ownership of tracks ceases at the south portal. The tracks extending therefrom in a southwesterly direction are owned and used by other railroad companies, but the movement of the trains is controlled by defendant.\n The tunnel and the tracks leading from it across square 693 were located and constructed and are now maintained under the authority of acts of Congress of February 12, 1901, and February 28, 1903 (31 Stat. at L. 774, chap. 354; 32 Stat. at L. 909, chap. 856), in accordance with plans and specifications approved by those acts. No claim is made by plaintiff that the tunnel, the tracks in square 693, and the trains operated therein and thereon, were constructed, operated, or maintained in a negligent manner; and it is conceded that the tunnel and tracks were built upon property acquired by purchase or condemnation proceedings, and were constructed under authority of the acts of Congress \n\n[233 U.S. 546, 551]\n\u00a0\n and of permits issued by the Commissioners of the District of Columbia.\n Such being the essential facts to be deduced from the evidence, we have reached the conclusion, for reasons presently to be stated, that with respect to most of the elements of damage to which the plaintiff's property has been subjected, the courts below correctly held them to be damnum absque injuria; but that with respect to such damage as is attributable to the gases and smoke emitted from locomotive engines while in the tunnel, and forced out of it by means of the fanning system through a portal located so near to plaintiff's property that these gases and smoke materially contribute to injure the furniture and to render the house less habitable than otherwise it would be, there is a right of recovery.\n The acts of Congress referred to, followed by the construction of the tunnel and railroad tracks substantially in the mode prescribed, had the effect of legalizing the construction and operation of the railroad, so that its operation, while properly conducted and regulated, cannot be deemed to be a public nuisance. Yet it is sufficiently obvious that the acts done by defendant, if done without legislative sanction, would form the subject of an action by plaintiff to recover damages as for a private nuisance.\n At the same time, there is no exclusive and permanent appropriation of any portion of plaintiff's land, which, indeed, does not even abut upon defendant's property. The acts of Congress do not in terms provide for the payment of compensation to property owners damnified through the construction and operation of the tunnel and railroad lines in question, except to those whose lands, or a portion thereof, were necessarily appropriated. For damages, whether direct or consequential, to noncontiguous parcels such as that of plaintiff, there is no express provision. But  9 of the act of 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 916, chap. 856) authorizes the Terminal Company to acquire, by purchase or condemna- \n\n[233 U.S. 546, 552]\n\u00a0\n tion, 'the lands and property necessary for all and every the purposes contemplated' by the several acts of Congress under which the tunnel and railroad were constructed and are operated. This grant of the power of condemnation is very broad, but it has not been acted upon by the company in the case of the present plaintiff. And since he is not wholly excluded from the use and enjoyment of his property, there has been no 'taking' of the land in the ordinary sense.\n The courts of England, in a series of decisions, have dealt with the general subject now under consideration.

The rule to be deduced from these cases is that while no action will lie for an invasion of private rights necessarily resulting from the establishment and operation of railways and other public works under the express sanction of an act of Parliament, yet that such acts are to be strictly construed so as not to impair private rights unless the legislative purpose to do so appears by express words or necessary implication. In short, Parliament, being omnipotent, may authorize the taking of private property for public use without compensation to the owner; but the courts decline to place an unjust construction upon its acts, and will not interpret them as interfering with rights of private property unless the language be so clear as to admit of no other meaning.\n But the legislation we are dealing with must be construed in the light of the provision of the 5th Amendment-'Nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation'-and is not to be given \n\n[233 U.S. 546, 553]\n\u00a0\n an effect inconsistent with its letter or spirit. The doctrine of the English cases has been generally accepted by the courts of this country, sometimes with scant regard for distinctions growing out of the constitutional restrictions upon legislative action under our system. Thus, it has been said that 'a railroad authorized by law and lawfully operated cannot be deemed a private nuisance;' that 'what the legislature has authorized to be done cannot be deemed unlawful,' etc. These and similar expressions have at times been indiscriminately employed with respect to public and to private nuisances. We deem the true rule, under the 5th Amendment, as under state constitutions containing a similar prohibition, to be that while the legislature may legalize what otherwise would be a public nuisance, it may not confer immunity from action for a private nuisance of such a character as to amount in effect to a taking of private property for public use. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Angel, 41 N. J. Eq. 316, 329, 56 Am. Rep. 1, 7 Atl. 432; Costigan v. Pennsylvania R. Co. 54 N. J. L. 233, 23 Atl. 810; Cogswell v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co. 103 N. Y. 10, 57 Am. Rep. 701, 8 N. E. 537; Garvey v. Long Island R. Co. 159 N. Y. 323, 70 Am. St. Rep. 550, 54 N. E. 57; Bohan v. Port Jervis Gaslight Co. 122 N. Y. 18, 29, 9 L.R.A. 711, 25 N. E. 246; Sadlier v. New York, 40 Misc. 78, 81 N. Y. Supp. 308.\n But the question remains, in cases of the class now before us, What is to be deemed a private nuisance such as amounts to a taking of property? And by a great and preponderant weight of judicial authority in those states whose constitutions contain a prohibition of the taking of private property for public use without compensation, substantially in the form employed in the 5th Amendment, it has become established that railroads constructed and operated for the public use, although with private capital and for private gain, are not subject to actions in behalf of neighboring property owners for the ordinary damages attributable to the operation of the railroad, in the absence of negligence. Such roads are treated as \n\n[233 U.S. 546, 554]\n\u00a0\n public highways, and the proprietors as public servants, with the exemption normally enjoyed by such servants from liability to private suit, so far as concerns the incidental damages accruing to owners of nonadjacent land through the proper and skilful management and operation of the railways. Any diminution of the value of property not directly invaded nor peculiarly affected, but sharing in the common burden of incidental damages arising from the legalized nuisance, is held not to be a 'taking' within the constitutional provision. The immunity is limited to such damages as naturally and unavoidably result from the proper conduct of the road and are shared generally by property owners whose lands lie within range of the inconveniences necessarily incident to proximity to a railroad. It includes the noises and vibrations incident to the running of trains, the necessary emission of smoke and sparks from the locomotives, and similar annoyances inseparable from the normal and non-negligent operation of a railroad. Northern Transp. Co. v. Chicago, \n99 \nU.S. 635, 641\n, 25 S. L. ed. 336, 338; Beseman v. Pennsylvania R. Co. 50 N. J. L. 235, 240, 13 Atl. 164, affirmed in 52 N. J. L. 221, 20 Atl. 169.\n That the constitutional inhibition against the taking of private property for public use without compensation does not confer a right to compensation upon a landowner, no part of whose property has been actually appropriated, and who has sustained only those consequential damages that are necessarily incident to proximity to the railroad, has been so generally recognized that in some of the states (Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming are, we believe, among the number) constitutions have been established providing in substance that private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without compensation.\n The immunity from liability for incidental injuries is \n\n[233 U.S. 546, 555]\n\u00a0\n attended with a considerable degree of hardship to the private landowner, and has not been adopted without some judicial protest. But, as pointed out by Chief Justice Beasley in the Beseman Case, 50 N. J. L. at p. 238, if railroad companies were liable to suit for such damages upon the theory that with respect to them the company is a tort feasor, the practical result would be to bring the operation of railroads to a standstill. And, on the whole, the doctrine has become so well established that it amounts to a rule of property, and should be modified, if at all, only by the lawmaking power.\n But the doctrine, being founded upon necessity, is limited accordingly. This court, in a leading case that we deem controlling upon the questions now at issue, had occasion to recognize this, and at the same time to apply the distinction between public and private nuisances with respect to the private right of action. In Baltimore & P. R. Co. v. Fifth Baptist Church, \n108 U.S. 317\n, 27 L. ed. 739, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 719, the court, while recognizing (p. 331) that the legislative authority for operating a railway carried with it an immunity from private actions based upon those incidental inconveniences that are unavoidably attendant upon the operation of a railroad, nevertheless sustained the right of action in a case where a building for housing and repairing locomotive engines was unnecessarily established in close proximity to a place of public worship, and so used that the noises of the shop and the rumbling of the locomotive engines passing in and out, the blowing off of steam, the ringing of bells, the sound of whistles, and the smoke from the chimneys, created a constant disturbance of the religious exercises. The court (speaking by Mr. Justice Field) held that the authority of the company to construct such works as it might deem necessary and expedient for the completion and maintenance of its road did not authorize it to place them wherever it might think proper in the city, without reference to the property and rights \n\n[233 U.S. 546, 556]\n\u00a0\n of others; and that whatever the extent of the authority conferred, it was accompanied with the implied qualification that the works should not be so placed as by their use to unreasonably interfere with and disturb the peaceful and comfortable enjoyment of others in their property. In the language of the opinion: 'Grants of privileges or powers to corporate bodies like those in question confer no license to use them in disregard of the private rights of others, and with immunity for their invasion.' The reasoning proceeded upon the ground (p. 332) that no authority conferred by Congress would justify an invasion of private property to an extent amounting to an entire deprivation of its use and enjoyment, without compensation to the owner; 'nor could such authority be invoked to justify acts creating physical discomfort and annoyance to others in the use and enjoyment of their property, to a less extent than entire deprivation, if different places from those occupied could be used by the corporation for its purposes, without causing such discomfort and annoyance;' and hence that the legislative authorization conferred exemption only from suit or prosecution for the public nuisance, and did not affect 'any claim of a private citizen for damages for any special inconvenience and discomfort not experienced by the public at large.'\n The present case, in the single particular already alluded to,-that is to say, with respect to so much of the damage as is attributable to the gases and smoke emitted from locomotive engines while in the tunnel, and forced out of it by the fanning system therein installed, and issuing from the portal located near to plaintiff's property in such manner as to materially contribute to render his property less habitable than otherwise it would be, and to depreciate it in value; and this without, so far as appears, any real necessity existing for such damage,-is, in our opinion, within the reason and authority of the decision just cited. This case differs from that of the Baptist Church, \n\n[233 U.S. 546, 557]\n\u00a0\n in that there the railroad company was free to select some other location for the repair shop and engine house; while here the evidence shows that the location of the tunnel and its south portal was established pursuant to law, and not voluntarily chosen by defendant. This circumstance, however, does not, as we think, afford sufficient ground for a distinction affecting the result. The case shows that Congress has authorized, and in effect commanded, defendant to construct its tunnel with a portal located in the midst of an inhabited portion of the city. The authority, no doubt, includes the use of steam locomotive engines in the tunnel, with the inevitable concomitants of foul gases and smoke emitted from the engines. No question is made but that it includes the installation and operation of a fanning system for ridding the tunnel of this source of discomfort to those operating the trains and traveling upon them. All this being granted, the special and peculiar damage to the plaintiff as a property owner in close proximity to the portal is the necessary consequence, unless at least it be feasible to install ventilating shafts or other devices for preventing the outpouring of gases and smoke from the entire length of the tunnel at a single point upon the surface, as at present. Construing the acts of Congress in the light of the 5th Amendment, they do not authorize the imposition of so direct and peculiar and substantial a burden upon plaintiff's property without compensation to him. If the damage is not preventible by the employment at reasonable expense of devices such as have been suggested, then plaintiff's property is 'necessary for the purposes contemplated,' and may be acquired by purchase or condemnation ( 32 Stat. at L. 916, chap. 856,  9), and pending its acquisition defendant is responsible. If the damage is readily preventible, the statute furnishes no excuse, and defendant's responsibility follows on general principles.\n No doubt there will be some practical difficulty in dis- \n\n[233 U.S. 546, 558]\n\u00a0\n tinguishing between that part of the damage which is attributable to the gases and smoke emitted from the locomotive engines while operated upon the railroad tracks adjacent to plaintiff's land, and with respect to which we hold there is no right of action, and damage that arises from the gases and smoke that issue from the tunnel, and with respect to which there appears to be a right of action. How this difficulty is to be solved in order to determine the damages that should be assessed in this action, or the compensation that should be awarded in case condemnation proceedings are resorted to, is a question not presented by this record, and upon which, therefore, no opinion is expressed.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded to the Court of Appeals, with directions to reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of the District and remand the cause to that court with directions for a new trial, and for further proceedings in accordance with the views above expressed.\n Mr. Justice Lurton dissents. \n\n\n\n","184":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRILEY v. COM. OF MASSACHUSETTS(1914)\nNo. 228\nArgued: Decided: March 23, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 671, 672]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Andrew J. Jennings, Israel Brayton, and Edward T. Fenwick for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 671, 676]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James M. Swift and Mr. Thomas J. Boynton, Attorney General of Massachusetts, for defendant in error.\n\n\n[232 U.S. 671, 678]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Criminal complaint brought against plaintiff in error in the superior court within and for the county of Bristol, charging him with the violation of a statute of the state in that he, being superintendent of the Davol Mills, a corporation duly established by law, and conducting a mill for the manufacture of cotton goods, in which establishment women were employed, employed two women by the names of Annie Manning and Nora Callahan at a time other than the time which the statute required to be posted in a conspicuous place in the mill where women were required to work in laboring. The specific charge is that the women were employed at 5 minutes of 1 o'clock (12:55 P. M.) on the 24th of February, 1910, in a room wherein was posted a notice in which it was stated that the time of commencing work was 6:50 A. M., and of stopping work was 6 P. M., and that the time allowed for dinner began at 12 M., and ended at 1 P. M.\n A demurrer and motion to quash were filed, alleging the unconstitutionality of the statute.\n The charge was dismissed as to Annie Manning, and plaintiff in error was convicted as to the charge in regard to Nora Callahan, and sentenced to pay a fine of $50. The sentence was affirmed by the supreme judicial court, and its rescript having been sent to the trial court, this writ of error was sued out. \n\n[232 U.S. 671, 679]\n\u00a0\n The statute of the state which is assailed provides that no child or woman shall be employed in laboring in any manufacturing or mechanical establishment more than ten hours in any one day, except as hereinafter provided in this section, unless a different apportionment of the hours of labor is made for the sole purpose of making a shorter day's work for one day of the week, and in no case shall the hours of labor exceed fifty-six in a week. It is provided: 'Every employer shall post in a conspicuous place in every room in which such persons are employed a printed notice stating the number of hours' work required of them on each day of the week, the hours of commencing and stopping work, and the hours when the time allowed for meals begins and ends. . . . The employment of such persons at any time other than as stated in said printed notice shall be deemed a violation of the provisions of this section,' punishable by a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $100.\n The first contention of plaintiff in error is that the statute restricts the right to sell and buy labor, and therein infringes the liberty of contract assured by article 14 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. The contention is untenable expressed in this generality. In Muller v. Oregon, \n208 U.S. 412\n, 52 L. ed. 551, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 324, 13 Ann. Cas. 957, against a similar contention, a statute of Oregon was sustained which prohibited the employment of women in mechanical factories or laundries working more than ten hours during any one day, with power, as in the Massachusetts statute, to apportion the hours through the day.\n But special objections are made which, it is contended, make Muller v. Oregon inapplicable. The prohibition of the statute under review, it is said, 'is not restricted to times and places which relate to and naturally and logically affect a woman's health, safety, or morals, or the welfare of herself or the public.' Such are the conditions necessary to the validity of a statute restricting employ- \n\n[232 U.S. 671, 680]\n\u00a0\n ment, it is contended, and that those conditions are not satisfied by the statute. Section 48, it is urged, not only prohibits the employment of women more than ten hours a day, but that (quoting the section) 'the employment of such person [woman] at a time other than as stated in said printed notice, shall be deemed a violation of the provisions of this section.'\n The provision is arbitrary and unreasonable, it is insisted, in that it requires the employer to post a notice in a room in which women and minors are permanently employed in laboring only six hours a day, and makes it a crime if such person is allowed to work for five minutes at a time other than as stated in the notice. But if we might imagine that an employer would so enlarge the restrictions of the statute, or be charged with violating it if he did, we yet must remember that, as it was competent for the state to restrict the hours of employment, it is also competent for the state to provide administrative means against evasion of the restriction. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 U.S. 549\n, 55 L. ed. 328, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 259; St. John v. New York, \n201 U.S. 633\n, 50 L. ed. 896, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 554, 5 Ann. Cas. 909. Neither the wisdom nor the legality of such means can be judged by extreme instances of their operation. The provision of  48 cannot be pronounced arbitrary. As said by the supreme judicial court, the statute 'requires the hours of labor to be stipulated in advance, and then to be followed until a change is made. It does not by its terms establish a schedule of hours. This is left to the free action of the parties. Nor does it in the sections now under consideration restrict the right to labor to any particular hours. See People v. Williams, 189 N. Y. 131, 12 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1130, 121 Am. St. Rep. 854, 81 N. E. 778, 12 Ann. Cas. 798. It simply makes imperative strict observance of any one table of hours of labor while it remains posted.\n'The end of the statute is the protection of women within constitutional limits, and the requirement that the hours posted in the notice shall be followed is a means to \n\n[232 U.S. 671, 681]\n\u00a0\n effectuate the attainment of that end.' [210 Mass. 394, 97 N. E. 367, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 388.] In other words, the purpose of the posting of the hours of labor is to secure certainty in the observance of the law, and to prevent the defeat or circumvention of its purpose by artful practices.\n\n There is a contention somewhat tentatively made by plaintiff in error that the statute offends the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. It will be observed that  48 provides that the printed form of the 'notice shall be provided by the chief of the district police, after approval by the attorney general.' And counsel say: 'If it be claimed that such a notice must first be approved by the attorney general of the state, our reply is that the statute says the form shall be approved; but if it is held that the attorney general is to approve the number of hours, and that the attorney general may say what the number of hours shall be, then he could approve or disapprove different notices stating different numbers of hours of employment by different employers. This seems to us to be a violation of the 14th Amendment, as denying equal protection of the laws.'\n And again counsel say, as a specification of the unreasonableness of the statute as an exercise of the police power of the state: 'By approval of different schedules by the attorney general, the law may operate unequally in different employments.' This supposition is based on the other; that is, that something else than the form of notice is to be prescribed by the attorney general. But counsel assert that it is the form only which the attorney general is to approve, and the assertion is not denied. There is, therefore, nothing tangible in the contention. Besides, it has no justification in the opinion of the supreme judicial court.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","185":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROE, EX PARTE(1914)\nNo. 13\nArgued: April 6, 1914Decided: May 25, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 70, 71]\n\u00a0\n Mr. S. P. Jones for petitioner.\n Messrs. Joseph W. Bailey and F. H. Prendergast for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n By an action begun in a state court in Harrison county, Texas, W. L. Roe sought to recover from the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, a Federal corporation, $30,000 as damages for personal injuries sustained through its negligence while he was in its employ as a brakeman, and while both were engaged in interstate commerce. In due time and in the accustomed way, the case was removed into the district court of the United States for that district upon the sole ground that it was one arising under a law of the United States, in that the defendant was chartered by an act of Congress. The plaintiff then moved that the case be remanded upon the ground that it also arose under the Federal employers' liability act (35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1322; 36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1324), and therefore was not removable. After a hearing, the motion was denied, for reasons assigned in the second branch of the opinion in Van Brimmer v. Texas & P. R. Co. 190 Fed. 394, 397. The plaintiff then petitioned this court for a wirt of mandamus commanding \n\n[234 U.S. 70, 72]\n\u00a0\n THE JUDGE OF THE DISTRICT COURT TO REMAnd the case. a rule to show cause was granted, and the respondent answered that the motion to remand had been denied because, upon consideration, he believed the case was lawfully removed.\n As the case arose under a law of the United States, namely, the defendant's Federal charter (see Pacific R. Removal Cases, \n115 U.S. 1\n, 29 L. ed. 319, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1113; Texas & P. R. Co. v. Cody, \n166 U.S. 606\n, 41 L. ed. 1132, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 703, 1 Am. Neg. Rep. 763), and the requisite amount was in controversy, it is conceded that it was removable unless made otherwise by the fact that it also arose under the Federal employers' liability act. In the 6th section, as amended in 1910, that act declares: 'The jurisdiction of the courts of the United States under this act shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several states, and no case arising under this act, and brought in any state court of competent jurisdiction, shall be removed to any court of the United States.' A like restriction upon removals appears in  28 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1094, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. p. 140].\n The question presented to the district court by the motion to remand was whether these provisions were intended to forbid a removal in every case falling within the employers' liability act, regardless of the presence of some independent ground of removal, as in this instance, or only to declare that the fact that a case arises under that act shall not be a ground of removal. Regarding the latter of these alternatives as sustained by the better reasoning, the court denied the motion; and upon this petition for mandamus we are asked to review that ruling, pronounce it erroneous, and direct the respondent to retract it and remand the case.\n Whether the ruling was right or wrong, it was a judicial act, done in the exercise of a jurisdiction conferred by law, and, even if erroneous, was not void or open to collateral attack, but only subject to correction in an appropriate appellate proceeding.

Rep. 18. Like any other ruling in the progress of the case, it will be regularly subject to appellate review after final judgment, and the authorized mode of obtaining such a review, the action being at law, is by a writ of error.

Rep. 389.\n The accustomed office of a writ of mandamus, when directed to a judicial officer, is to compel an exercise of existing jurisdiction, but not to control his decision. It does not lie to compel a reversal of a decision, either interlocutory of final, made in the exercise of a lawful jurisdiction, especially where in regular course the decision may be reviewed upon a writ of error or an appeal.

In the last case the subject was extensively considered and it was held that the writ of mandamus may not be used to correct alleged error in a refusal to remand where, after final judgment, the order may be reviewed upon a writ of error or an appeal.

MURRAY(1914)\nNo. 966\nArgued: Decided: June 22, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 738, 739]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John E. Roller, in propria persona, and Herbert W. Wyant for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Holmes Conrad and Edward S. Conrad for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This writ of error was sued out under  237, Judicial Code (act of March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 227), in order to bring under review a judgment of the supreme court of appeals of the state of West Virginia (71 W. Va. 161, -- L.R.A. ( N.S.) --, 76 S. E. 172), which affirmed a decree of the circuit court of Pendleton county, in that state, in an equitable action brought by plaintiff in error against defendants in error. His original bill was filed May 10, 1901, and an amended bill was filed in December, 1907. Complainant therein averred that in the year 1872 he was employed by the late Emily Hollingsworth, of the city of Philadelphia, as attorney, to recover for her a tract of 52,000 acres of land situate in the counties of Rockingham and Augusta, in the state of Virginia, and the county of Pendleton, in the state of West Virginia, and immediately undertook \n\n[234 U.S. 738, 740]\n\u00a0\n the necessary work and labor, and diligently and faithfully endeavored to discharge the duties imposed upon him by the employment; that from time to time various parcels of land were recovered from adverse claimants, some by compromise settlements and others by actions of ejectment, until the entire tract of 52,000 acres was recovered, the actual litigation not being completed until some time in the year 1893; that portions of the property had been sold, so that in the year 1889 there remained of the lands recovered about 44,000 acres undisposed of, from the proceeds of the sale of which complainant was to receive payments on account of his services; that on or about April 1, 1889, the said Emily Hollingsworth made a deed of gift of the unsold lands, amounting to about 44,000 acres, to Mary H. Murray, one of the defendants, upon condition that she should pay to complainant one fifth of the proceeds thereafter to be realized on the sale of the lands, and that she should hold the same as trustee for complainant, and complainant avers that the said Mary H. Murray accepted said deed upon that condition, and became liable to complainant for the said proportion of said proceeds of sale and for the reasonable value of his services rendered by him to Miss Hollingsworth, and to be thereafter rendered to the said Mary H. Murray; that the latter, having accepted the conveyance, continued to act under it and in conformity with it until May 25, 1901, when for the first time she repudiated it. The object of the bill was to enforce a trust as to the undivided one fifth of the land and of the purchase money upon sales made of the same, as against Mary H. Murray and her grantees with notice. Mrs. Murray pleaded that in a chancery cause brought by the same complainant against her, with others, in the circuit court for the county of Rockingham, in the state of Virginia, a court of competent jurisdiction, complainant asserted and claimed that there was due to him from her the same sum of money and the same \n\n[234 U.S. 738, 741]\n\u00a0\n debt, as compensation for the same services alleged in his present bill, and that the cause of action was the same as now set up and asserted; that on June 24, 1907, a final decree was made and entered in said cause by the said circuit court, and this, on appeal, was affirmed by the supreme court of appeals of Virginia in accordance with opinions found in 107 Va. 527, 59 S. E. 421, in which it was held that defendant Mary H. Murray was a privy in estate to Miss Hollingsworth, her grantor, and a privy also to the contract with complainant, and that the said supreme court of appeals of Virginia, affirming the circuit court, determined that complainant had no right to recover on said cause of action, wherefore defendant pleaded the final adjudication of the Virginia court as res judicata. There was filed with the plea a certified copy of the record of the proceedings had in the circuit court of Rockingham county, Virginia, and in the supreme court of appeals of that state. Subsequently, complainant filed in the Pendleton county court written objections to the plea of res judicata upon the following grounds: First, that the circuit court of Rockingham county, Virginia, after the rendition of the judgment pleaded by defendant, in another cause pending in that court between the Chesapeake-Western Company and the complainant, John E. Roller, and others, in which latter cause the said Mary H. Murray was impleaded as a party, decreed that the matters involved in the cause pending in the circuit court of Pendleton county, West Virginia, were not concluded by the judgment and decree of the circuit court of Rockingham county, Virginia, and did therefore vacate and dissolve certain injunctions previously awarded in that cause, restraining complainant from further prosecution in the West Virginia court of his present suit against said Mary H. Murray. Secondly, that the cause of action and grounds of jurisdiction and relief in the present cause are \n\n[234 U.S. 738, 742]\n\u00a0\n not the same as those set out in the record filed in the plea of res judicata. And thirdly, that the record and judgment of the Virginia court should not be enforced arres judicata for the following reasons: (a) that the courts of West Virginia do not enforce foreign judgments that are contrary to the laws and public policy of that state; (b) that the decree rests not upon rights arising ex contractu, or upon torts based on natural rights, but upon a penalty denounced by the policy of the law of Virginia which is not so denounced by the policy of the law of the state of West Virginia, and that it is not one of such nature as the courts of West Virginia will enforce; and (c) that the lex loci rei sitoe determines the jurisdiction and relief to be given by this court as to the land in the bill referred to, regardless of the judgment of any sister state as to land therein situate.\n The circuit court of Pendleton county, West Virginia, sustained the plea of res judicata and dismissed the bill, and it is the judgment of the court of last resort of West Virginia, affirming this decree, that is now under review.\n There are three assignments of error, the substance of which is as follows:\n First, that the court erred in holding that the plea of res judicata filed by the defendant Mary H. Murray was a good and sufficient plea, for the reason that the decree therein relied upon in terms provided that it should be without prejudice to complainant's right to institute other proceedings upon a quantum meruit if so advised, and that the record shows the cause of action and ground of jurisdiction were not the same in the present West Virginia action as those set out and contained in the record in the Virginia action; the present action being based upon a quantum meruit for just and reasonable compensation for services rendered by complainant in and about the recovery of the tract of land in controversy. \n\n[234 U.S. 738, 743]\n\u00a0\n Second, that the court erred in sustaining the action of the court below upholding the plea of res judicata, because the decrees in the Virginia courts presented in that plea were void and of no effect, since they had denied to complainant due process of law, in that they had denied to him the right to file the third amended bill of complaint tendered by him, and denied him a hearing upon the case thereby presented.\n Third, that the court erred in sustaining the action of the court below in overruling the objections made by complainant to the plea of res judicata, because in the suit of Chesapeake-Western Co. v. Roller, it was necessarily decided that the matters involved in the case in the West Virginia courts were not concluded by the decrees rendered in the first cause of Roller v. Murray in the Virginia courts.\n There is a motion to dismiss or affirm, based upon the ground that no Federal question is raised by the record, or that, if any such question is raised, it is so frivolous as not to need further argument.\n It appears that the Virginia court (107 Va. 527, 59 S. E. 421) denied relief to complainant with respect to the lands in that state upon the ground that the contract upon which the action was based was champertous, and therefore illegal under the laws of the commonwealth. The supreme court of appeals of West Virginia (71 W. Va. 161, -- L.R.A.(N.S.) --, 76 S. E. 172), finding that this decision was rendered not in a mere proceeding in rem or quasi in rem, but in an action in personam (defendants having appeared, and the validity of the contract constituting the basis of the plaintiff's claim to the fund or to the land having been actually litigated by the parties and decided by the courts), that decision necessarily settled and determined the question of the validity of the contract in the state of Virginia, and that under the 'full faith and credit' clause of the Constitution of the United States the decision was entitled to the same credit \n\n[234 U.S. 738, 744]\n\u00a0\n in West Virginia that it had in the commonwealth of Virginia. Upon this ground, although assuming that the contract was valid under the law of West Virginia, viewed independently of the Virginia decision, the court held itself bound by the Virginia decision to deny relief to complainant.\n It is argued under the first assignment of error that the contract in controversy must be held to be a Pennsylvania contract, and that its validity and enforcement in the courts of West Virginia did not depend upon the decision of the Virginia courts, but required an independent consideration upon its merits by the courts of West Virginia, and that their failure to give such consideration was a denial of due process of law. We are unable to find that it was contended in the courts of West Virginia that the contract in question was made in Pennsylvania, or ought for other reasons to be regarded as a Pennsylvania contract; nor are we able to find that the 'due process of law' clause was invoked in the West Virginia courts upon the ground that to follow the Virginia decision would be a denial of the right of plaintiff in error to such process. Assuming the contention to have been made, we are unable to see that any Federal question was thereby raised. Supposing the courts of West Virginia erred in giving conclusive effect to the Virginia decision, this was no more than an error of law, committed in the exercise of jurisdiction over the subject-matter and the parties; and such an error-not involving a Federal question-affords no opportunity for a review of this court.\n The same response must be made to the second argument presented under the first assignment of error; which is that the contract in controversy shows that its terms, so far as they related to the property within the jurisdiction of West Virginia, were different from those which related to the property in Virginia, and that the West Virginia court, in holding them to be the same, and refusing \n\n[234 U.S. 738, 745]\n\u00a0\n to recognize the contract as a West Virginia contract, deprived plaintiff in error of his property without due process of law.\n It is not contended that the West Virginia court, in holding the Virginia judgment to be conclusive upon the present controversy, violated the 'full faith and credit' clause of the Federal Constitution. \n2\n By that clause, and by the act of Congress ( 905, Rev. Stat. U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 677) passed to carry it into effect, it was incumbent upon the West Virginia court to give to the judgment the same faith and credit that it had by law or usage in the courts of Virginia. The effect of this was that, provided the Virginia court had jurisdiction of the subject-matter and of the parties (which was not questioned), the merits of the controversy there concluded were not open to reinvestigation in the courts of West Virginia. It is not here questioned that the West Virginia courts gave such credit to the Virginia judgment as was thus required.\n Under the second assignment of error, the argument is that plaintiff in error was denied due process in the Virginia courts in that the circuit court of Rockingham county arbitrarily and unlawfully rejected his third amended bill, and its action in so doing was affirmed by the court of last resort of that state. Upon this point the West Virginia court (71 W. Va. 170) said:\n'The said amendment was offered at a very late stage of the proceedings. The court based its rejection thereof upon two grounds,-the delay in tendering it without excuse or explanation, and its failure to show a contract materially different from that set up in the original and first and second amended bills. In disposing of the amendment, the court said: 'The bill had been amended twice already, and after these amendments, and after a thorough argument of the case on its merits, the court announced its decision. A due regard for the orderly procedure of the court and the rights of the opposing party required \n\n[234 U.S. 738, 746]\n\u00a0\n that some limit be set to the privilege of amendments. The amendments now presented are offered without explanation or excuse, and in the main are unsubstantial, and would not change the opinion of the court on the merits of the case.' Having said this, the court proceeded to analyze the amendments and show their lack of merit and insufficiency to bring about a different conclusion if they had been filed. The decision relied upon to sustain this contention is Hovey v. Elliott, \n167 U.S. 409\n, 42 L. ed. 215, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 841, asserting lack of due process in the entry of a decree for the plaintiff, after having stricken out the defendant's answer, because he was guilty of contempt in neglecting to pay into court a certain sum of money. This was a total denial of the right of defense, upon an insufficient ground. In that case, the action of the court was arbitrary and oppressive. Here, the plaintiff has been allowed a hearing. He had filed an original and two amended bills, and had no doubt had opportunity to tender the third amended bill long before the submission of the cause. It is certainly competent for a court to say, within reasonable limits, what amounts to a compliance with its rules and the principles of law, respecting the order and limitations of proceedings in a case. Besides, in the opinion of the court, the proposed amendment would not have changed the character of the plaintiff's claim, nor relieved the contract of its infirmity. An erroneous decision in respect to either of these matters would not amount to a denial of due process of law. As to them, it is not a case in which the plaintiff has had no day in court.'\n\n For present purposes it is sufficient to say that there is nothing upon the face of the record to indicate that the refusal of the Virginia court to entertain complainant's third amended bill was arbitrary or unlawful, or otherwise inconsistent with the 'due process of law' clause of the 14th Amendment; that there is nothing to show that in the Virginia court complainant based his right to \n\n[234 U.S. 738, 747]\n\u00a0\n file a third amended bill upon the 14th Amendment; and that if he had in fact set up such a right in the Virginia court and it had been there denied, his proper mode of obtaining a review of the Federal question would have been by prosecuting a writ of error under  709, Rev. Stat., U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575 ( 237, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1911 Supp. p. 227]) to review the judgment of the court of last resort of Virginia, and not by attacking the judgment collaterally upon that ground when it was invoked against him in the courts of West Virginia.\n With respect to the third assignment of error, it is contended that the supreme court of appeals of West Virginia refused to give full faith and credit to the objection interposed by plaintiff in error to the plea of res judicata based upon the decrees rendered in the Virginia case of Roller v. Murray, the objection being based upon the record in the case of Chesapeake-Western Co. v. Roller, a subsequent decision in the Virginia courts, which, it is contended, overruled the decision in the first Virginia suit so far as it tended to debar plaintiff in error from suing upon a quantum meruit. It appears that the decision in the Chesapeake- Western Co. Case was to dissolve an injunction that had been issued against the prosecution of the West Virginia suit. Its effect as res judicata was denied by the West Virginia court (71 W. Va. 172) upon the ground that it was not a final decree. It is now contended that, subsequent to the decree dissolving the injunction, a final decree was rendered in the same cause which in effect concluded the merits. We find nothing in the record, however, to show that any such contention was presented to the West Virginia courts.\n Since we are unable to find that any substantial question of Federal right was raised by plaintiff in error in the courts of West Virginia, and there decided against him, it follows that the writ of error must be dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Art. 4,  1. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1156 (U.

DAY(1914)\nNo. 122\nArgued: December 11, 1913Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 110, 111]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Kenneth S. Murchison for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Jerre P. O'Meara and James A. Veasey for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 110, 112]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was brought by the present plaintiffs in error for the purpose of obtaining a decree declaring the defendant in error to be a trustee for the plaintiffs with respect to the title to certain lands in the Cherokee Nation (a tract of 20 acres, and a separate tract of 10 acres within the same quarter section) that were allotted to defendant in error under the act of July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 716, chap. 1375). The decision of the Oklahoma supreme court in favor of the latter is reported in 29 Okla. 186, 116 Pac. 949.\n Plaintiffs are citizens by blood of the Cherokee Nation, and entitled to allotments under  11 of the act; defendant is a registered Delaware, entitled to allotment under  23. Defendant filed applications in the Cherokee Land Office for the lands in controversy on May 5, 1904, and they were set apart to him as portions of his allotment selection. Later, and on July 1 in the same year, the plaintiff, Robert B. Ross, appeared at the Land Office and made application for the same lands, a portion to be set apart to himself and a portion for his wife. These applications being refused because the lands had already been selected by defendant, plaintiffs immediately brought contests, which were consolidated and heard together by \n\n[232 U.S. 110, 113]\n\u00a0\n the Commissioner of the Five Civilized Tribes, and he decided in favor of contestants. Upon appeal to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs this decision was affirmed. But upon a further appeal to the Secretary of the Interior there was a decision against the plaintiffs and in favor of defendant. The contests were based upon the same alleged equity upon which the present action is founded; that is, contestants, admitting the prior allotments to contestee, insisted that his application was subject to their prior right of selection upon the ground that they were the owners of improvements that were upon the property at the time contestee entered upon it. The question turns upon the effect of  11 of the act of July 1, 1902, already referred to, which reads as follows: 'There shall be allotted by the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes and to each citizen of the Cherokee tribe, as soon as practicable after the approval by the Secretary of the Interior of his enrolment as herein provided, land equal in value to one hundred and ten acres of the average allottable lands of the Cherokee Nation, to conform as nearly as may be to the areas and boundaries established by the government survey, which land may be selected by each allottee so as to include his improvements.'\n The findings of the Secretary were as follows: That the lands in question were claimed prior to 1902 by a firm of Johnstone & Keeler, Cherokee citizens, and constituted portions of a large tract which was at one time wholly or partially inclosed by wire fence; that the members of the firm divided their holdings between them, and Keeler took that part which included the lands in contest; that on November 1, 1902, Keeler transferred his possessory interest in this land, with the improvements thereon, to the contestants by bill of sale; but at this time the fencing was pretty well down, and the land contained no improvements of material value, except that about 1 1\/2 \n\n[232 U.S. 110, 114]\n\u00a0\n acres were under cultivation by one Bixler, a noncitizen who farmed adjacent lands, but whose improvement was not to be credited to contestants; that contestants did nothing in the way of placing improvements upon the property until March 1, 1904, when their son, Dr. Ross, visited the land, and with the assistance of a surveyor and two other persons, located the lines, and indicated them by setting posts or stakes; that these posts were cut and set by two men in about five hours; that some of the posts were about the size of a man's arm, and others were mere stakes or poles; that they were placed from 50 to 100 feet apart, except at the corners, where five posts were set in comparative proximity; the posts bounding the tracts were not joined, by wire or otherwise, so as to make a connected fence; and no further act of improvement or occupation was done in behalf of the contestants. That, on the other hand, the contestee, who had lived in the neighborhood of the land for about thirty years, and claimed to have cut timber, posts, and fuel upon it for twenty- five years past, when he learned on March 1, 1904, of the efforts made by Dr. Ross and his party to survey and inclose it, immediately purchased the necessary wire and proceeded to fence the property, cutting a part of the posts and buying part; that, he being assisted by his son, the work required about two and a half days; that in constructing this fence two wires were used for the greater part of its length, and the controverted tracts were substantially inclosed; that after thus fencing the land, and before filing thereon, he erected a threeroom house at a cost of about $ 250 upon one of the tracts, and immediately took up his residence therein.\n The Secretary of the Interior concluded that the fences upon the tracts in question at the time of the alleged purchase by the plaintiffs from Keeler were not of sufficient consequence or value in connection with the land to be entitled to be classed as improvements; that the \n\n[232 U.S. 110, 115]\n\u00a0\n posts established by Dr. Ross, March 1, 1904, did not constitute a lawful improvement, but were merely set for the purpose of marking or defining a prospective allotment; and further, that the improvements erected by contestee, while built possibly later than the former, were of material value to the land, and also that contestee actually entered into possession.\n The contention of the plaintiffs in error here, as in the court below, is that under the laws of the Cherokee Nation and the act of Congress they acquired the right of possession of the lands in controversy by virtue of the bill of sale from Keeler, dated November 1, 1902, and thereby succeeded to the same right to allot these lands that Keeler had before; that this right was made exclusive by what was done on March 1, 1904, looking to the placing of improvements upon the tracts; that this was sufficient to give notice to other citizens of the Cherokee Nation of the intention of plaintiffs to locate the lands, and that defendant was present at the time and had actual notice of the work done by Dr. Ross. Reference is made to the Constitution of the Cherokee Nation, art. I.,  2, and to its Laws (1892)  706, 761, and 762. It will not be necessary to recite them at length, because all that is claimed with respect to their effect upon the present controversy was conceded or assumed in the decision of the Secretary of the Interior; that is, that citizens of the Cherokee Nation might improve portions of the public domain within the Nation, and thereby establish a prior right to the possession of the improved lands, which right might be transferred to another citizen by a sale of the improvements. The Secretary evidently construed  11 of the act of Congress of July 1, 1902, as recognizing and confirming this right. But he held that no valuable interest was acquired by plaintiffs under the purchase from Keeler, because Keeler owned no improvements of material value. He found plaintiffs were not entitled to credit for the \n\n[232 U.S. 110, 116]\n\u00a0\n small improvement of the noncitizen Bixler, and there is nothing before us to show that the Keeler bill of sale included the Bixler improvements, or that Bixler held as tenant either of Keeler or of plaintiffs. And he held in effect that the question of the sufficiency of what was done by contestants on March 1, 1904, depended not upon whether it was sufficient to give notice to contestee, but whether it was sufficient to constitute an improvement within the meaning of the act of Congress. And so the whole controversy in effect depended upon whether the allotment to defendant was in accord with the ownership of the actual improvements upon the land, and the fact respecting the improvements was the principal matter to be determined in the contest proceedings, wherein the final appeal was to the Secretary of the Interior.\n In order to obviate the established rule that the decisions of the Executive Departments in matters confided to them by the acts of Congress are not to be disturbed by the courts unless there be allegations of fraud raised in the pleadings and established at the trial, it is contended that this rule extends only to findings upon mere questions of fact, and that the decision of the Secretary of the Interior upon the contest here in question was based solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\n But, in our opinion, whether plaintiffs had improved the lands in such sense as to give them a preferential right under the statute was not a mere question of law, but rather a mixed question of law and fact. So far as it involved an appreciation of the term 'improvements,' as employed in the statute, it was a question of law; so far as it involved the drawing of correct inferences from the evidence, it was a question of fact. At best, it was a close question, about which reasonable men might well differ.\n In Whitcomb v. White, \n214 \nU.S. 15, 16\n, 53 S. L. ed. 889, 890, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 599, this court, speaking by Mr. Justice Brewer, said: 'The decision of the \n\n[232 U.S. 110, 117]\n\u00a0\n Land Department was not rested solely upon the fact that White's formal application was filed a few hours before that of the trustee for the occupants of the town site, but rather chiefly upon the priority of the former's equitable rights. So far as such decision involves questions of fact, it is conclusive upon the courts [citing cases]. And this rule is applied in cases where there is a mixed question of law and fact, unless the court is able to so separate the question as to see clearly what and where the mistake of law is. As said by Mr. Justice Miller in Marquez v. Frisbie, 101 U. S. p. 476, 25 L. ed. 800: 'This means, and it is a sound principle, that where there is a mixed question of law and of fact, and the court cannot so separate it as to see clearly where the mistake of law is, the decision of the tribunal to which the law has confided the matter is conclusive.\" And see Moore v. Robbins, \n96 \nU.S. 530, 535\n, 24 S. L. ed. 848, 850; Quinby v. Conlan, \n104 \nU.S. 420, 426\n, 26 S. L. ed. 800, 802; Gonzales v. French, \n164 U.S. 338\n, 41 L. ed. 458, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 102.\n There being no fraud, and no clear mistake of law in the decision of the Secretary of the Interior, his findings are conclusive upon the barties in the present controversy.\n Judgment affirmed \n\n\n\n","188":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRUBBER TIRE WHEEL CO. v.

A. Toulmin for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The petitioners are the owners of the Grant patent (No. 554,675) issued February 18, 1896, for an improvement in rubber-tired wheels. In a suit for infringement brought by the petitioners against the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (the respondent) it was held by the circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit that the patent was void for want of novelty. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Rubber Tire Wheel Co. 53 C. C. A. 583, 116 Fed. 363. Upon the basis of the decree entered upon that decision, the respondent instituted the present suit in the southern district of Ohio, to restrain the petitioners from prosecuting suits for infringement against the respondent's customers. The circuit court granted a preliminary injunction. Upon appeal, the circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit sustained the injunction so far as it applied to the prosecution of a suit which the petitioners had brought against John Doherty in the circuit court for the southern district of New York. 106 C. C. A. 318, 183 Fed. 978. This writ of certiorari was then granted. \n\n[232 U.S. 413, 415]\n\u00a0\n The Grant tire is composed of three elements: (1) a channel or groove with tapered or inclined sides, (2) a rubber tire with a described shape, adapted to fit into the channel, and (3) a fastening device consisting of independent retaining wires, which pass through the rubber tire and are placed in a particular position. It was held in the sixth circuit that both the elements and the results were old, and hence patentability was denied. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Rubber Tire Wheel Co. supra; Rubber- Tire Wheel Co. v. Victor Rubber-Tire Co. 59 C. C. A. 215, 123 Fed. 85. In the second circuit, and in the circuit court for the northern district of Georgia, the patent was sustained. Rubber Tire Wheel Co. v. Columbia Pneumatic Wagon Wheel Co. 91 Fed. 978; Consolidated Rubber Tire Co. v. Finley Rubber Tire Co. 116 Fed. 629; Consolidated Rubber Tire Co. v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. 147 Fed. 739, 80 C. C.

The controversy came to this court upon certiorari to review the decision of the circuit court of appeals for the second circuit in the case last mentioned, and it was finally determined that the patent was valid. Diamond Rubber Co. v. Consolidated Rubber Tire Co. \n220 U.S. 428\n, 55 L. ed. 527, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 444. The patented structure was held to be not a mere aggregation of elements, but a new combination of parts, co-acting so as to produce a new and useful result. It was found that the Grant tire possessed a distinctive characteristic; that is, a 'tipping and reseating power.' This, said this court, 'is the result of something more than each element acting separately. It is not the result alone of the iron channel, with diverging sides, nor alone of the retaining bands or the rubber. They each have uses and perform them to an end different from the effect of either, and they must have been designed to such end,-contrived to exactly produce it. There can be no other deduction from their careful relation. The adaptation of the rubber to \n\n[232 U.S. 413, 416]\n\u00a0\n the flaring channel, the shape of that permitting lateral movement and compression, the retaining band, holding and yielding, placed in such precise adjustment and correlation with the other parts, producing a tire that 'when compressed and bent sidewise shall not escape from the channel, and shall not be cut on the flange of the channel,' and yet shall 'be mobile in the channel.\" 220 U. S. p. 443. There was thus a patentable combination, the patentability of which did not depend on the novelty of any of the elements entering into it, whether rubber, iron, or wires.\n Doherty, against whom suit was enjoined, had a shop in New York city, where he was engaged in the business of applying rubber tires to vehicle wheels. It appeared that having purchased the rubber from the respondent, and the wire and channel from other parties, he combined these elements and fitted them to a carriage wheel, thus constructing a complete tire. This we may assume to be a typical case.\n It is at once apparent that the decree in favor of the Goodyear Company in the former suit does not work an estoppel in favor of Doherty, so as to afford him a defense against the charge of infringement in making the patented structure. He was not a party to the suit in which that decree was rendered; nor, at least with respect to tires made by him, can he be regarded as a privy to that decree. We may lay on one side the question as to the rights of one purchasing from the respondent the completed article. Doherty did not purchase it; he made it himself, assembling its various elements for that purpose and effecting the combination. On no possible theory can it be said that, if the tire thus constructed was covered by the patent, Doherty was entitled to immunity simply because he bought one element of the time from the Goodyear Company.\n The respondent, however, is asserting its own right, and not that of Doherty. It insists that, by virtue of the \n\n[232 U.S. 413, 417]\n\u00a0\n decree in its favor in the infringement suit, it should have the injunction in order to protect its trade. It contends that it has an equitable right to this protection by restraining suits not only against those who buy from it the structure which is the subject of the patent, but also against those who buy its rubber and themselves make the patented tire. In urging this contention the respondent relies upon the doctrine of Kessler v. Eldred, \n206 U.S. 285\n, 51 L. ed. 1065, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611. There, Kessler and Eldred were rival manufacturers of electric cigar lighters. Eldred, being the owner of the Chambers patent, sued Kessler in the northern distirict of Indiana for infringement. The circuit court, finding noninfringement, dismissed the bill; and this decree was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit. 45 C. C. A. 454, 106 Fed. 509. Subsequently, Eldred brought suit on the same patent in the northern district of New York against Kirkland, who was selling a similar cigar lighter, but not of Kessler's make. The circuit court of appeals for the second circuit held the Kirkland lighter to be an infringement. 64 C. C. A. 588, 130 Fed. 342. Eldred then began a suit for infringement in the western district of New York against Breitwieser, a user of Kessler's lighters. Thereupon Kessler filed his bill in the circuit court for the northern district of Illinois to enjoin Eldred from prosecuting suit against anyone for alleged infringement of the Chambers patent by purchase, use, or sale of any electric cigar lighter manufactured by Kessler, and identical with the lighter before the court in the suit of Eldred v. Kessler. Kessler, being defeated in the circuit court, appealed to the circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit. Answering questions certified by that court, this court held that the decree in the suit of Eldred v. Kessler had the effect of entitling Kessler to continue the business of manufacturing and selling throughout the United States, the same lighter he had theretofore been manufacturing and selling, without molestation by Eldred \n\n[232 U.S. 413, 418]\n\u00a0\n through the patent which he held; and that the decrea also had the effect of making a suit by Eldred against any customer of Kessler for the alleged infringement of the patent by use or sale of Kessler's lighters a wrongful interference with Kessler's business, with respect to which he was without adequate remedy at law. 206 U. S. pp. 287, 290.\n It will be observed that the equity thus sustained sprang from the decree in the former suit between the parties, and that the decision went no further than to hold it to be a wrongful interference with Kessler's business to sue his customers for using and selling the lighter which Kessler had made and sold to them, and which was the same as that passed upon by the court in the previous suit. His right to make and sell the particular article, the making of which Eldred had unsuccessfully challenged as an infringement, was deemed to include the right to have others secure in buying that article, and in its use and resale. But the present question was in no way involved. It was not held that Kessler would have been entitled to restrain Eldred from suing other manufacturers of lighters who might buy from Kessler some of the materials used in such manufacture.\n The distinction is controlling. Under the doctrine of Kessler v. Eldred, the respondent-by reason of the final adjudication in its favor- was entitled to make and sell the Grant structure, and to have those who bought that structure from it unmolested in taking title and in enjoying the rights of ownership. It may also be assumed that the respondent had the right to make and sell its rubber without hindrance by the petitioners claiming under the patent. The trade right of the respondent, however, whether with respect to the complete structure or its separate parts, is merely the right to have that which it lawfully produces freely bought and sold without restraint or interference. It is a right which attaches to its product-to a particular thing-as an article of lawful com- \n\n[232 U.S. 413, 419]\n\u00a0\n merce, and it continues only so long as the commodity to which the right applies retains its separate identity. If that commodity is combined with other things in the process of the manufacture of a new commodity, the trade right in the original part as an article of commerce is necessarily gone. So that when other persons become manufacturers on their own behalf, assembling the various elements and uniting them so as to produce the patented device,-a new article,-it is manifest that the respondent cannot insist upon their being protected from suit for infringement by reason merely of its right to make and sell, and the fact of its having made and sold, some component part of that article. It must be able to go beyond a mere trade right in that element, and to show itself to be entitled to have its customers manufacture the patented structure. Thus the fallacy in the respondent's contention becomes apparent. The decree gave the respondent no right to have others make Grant tires. It could make and sell them, and it could make and sell rubber; it could demand protection for its trade rights in the commodities it produced. But it had no transferable immunity in manufacture. The decree gave it no privilege to demand that others should be allowed to make and sell the patented structure in order that it might have a market for its rubber.\n The suit against Doherty was based upon his conduct in constructing Grant tires. The fact that the respondent could not be charged with liability as a participant in the infringement thus alleged did not excuse him; and the petitioners, in bringing the suit, did not violate any right of the respondent.\n It is not necessary to consider the evidence bearing upon the question whether Doherty had authority from the petitioners, as that is a matter between him and them; and if the facts afford him a defense, he is free to urge it.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, in so far \n\n[232 U.S. 413, 420]\n\u00a0\n as it affirmed the order of injunction granted by the Circuit Court, is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court, with instructions to enter an order denying the application for injunction.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice Day states that in his view the suit against Doherty was properly enjoined upon the principles established in this court in Kessler v. Eldred, \n206 U.S. 285\n, 51 L. ed. 1065, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611; and, without repeating, agrees with the reasoning by which that conclusion was reached in the opinion of Judge Warrington, speaking for the circuit court of appeals in this case. \n\n\n\n","189":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRUSSELL v.

He was acting on behalf of the Economic Gas Company, a corporation supplying inhabitants of the city with gas, and was engaged in preparing to lay its pipes in a street which it had not previously used. The company was proceeding under a claim of right based upon  19 of article 11 of the state Constitution of 1879, as amended in 1885, which was as follows:\n'Sec. 19. In any city where there are no public works owned and controlled by the municipality for supplying the same with water or artificial light, any individual, or any company duly incorporated for such purpose, under and by authority of the laws of this state, shall, under the direction of the superintendent of streets, or other officer in control thereof, and under such general regulations as the municipality may prescribe, for damages and indemnity for damages, have the privilege of using the public streets and thoroughfares thereof, and of laying down pipes and conduits therein, and connections therewith, so far as may be necessary for introducing into and supplying such city and its inhabitants either with gaslight or other illuminating light, or with fresh water for domestic and all other purposes, upon the condition that the municipal government shall have the right to regulate the charges thereof.'\n\n On October 10, 1911, this section of the Constitution was amended by the substitution of the following provision:\n'Sec. 19. Any municipal corporation may establish and operate public works for supplying its inhabitants with light, water, power, heat, transportation, telephone service, or other means of communication. Such works may be acquired by original construction or by the purchase of existing works, including their franchises, or both. Persons or corporations may establish and operate \n\n[233 U.S. 195, 199]\n\u00a0\n works for supplying the inhabitants with such services upon such conditions and under such regulations as the municipality may prescribe under its organic law, on condition that the municipal government shall have the right to regulate the charges thereof. A municipal corporation may furnish such services to inhabitants outside its boundaries, provided, that it shall not furnish any service to the inhabitants of any other municipality owning or operating works supplying the same service to such inhabitants without the consent of such other municipality, expressed by ordinance.'\n\n Thereupon, by ordinance approved October 26, 1911, the city of Los Angeles provided that no one should exercise any franchise or privilege to lay or maintain pipes or conduits in the streets for conveying gas, water, etc., without having obtained a grant from the city in accordance with the city's charter and the procedure prescribed by the ordinance, unless such person (or corporation) might be 'entitled to do so by direct and unlimited authority of the Constitution of the state of California, or of the Constitution or laws of the United States.' Another ordinance, approved February 21, 1912, declared that it should be unlawful to make any excavation in a street for any purpose without written permission from the board of public works, and that before issuing the permit the board should require the applicant to show legal authority to use the streets for the purpose specified.\n It was under the last-mentioned ordinance that the charge was laid against the plaintiff in error. A writ of habeas corpus was sued out upon the ground that the municipal legislation, and the constitutional amendment upon which it rested, so far as they interfered with the extension by the company of its lighting system within the city, impaired the obligation of the company's contract with the state in violation of article I,  10, of the Federal Constitution, and also deprived it of its property \n\n[233 U.S. 195, 200]\n\u00a0\n without due process of law, and denied to it the equal protection of the laws, contrary to the 14th Amendment. The writ was returnable before the supreme court of the state.\n It appeared that the Economic Gaslight Company was organized in 1909 and thereupon undertook to manufacture and distribute gas within the city for lighting purposes. As there were no gas works owned and controlled by the city, the constitutional provision (as it stood before the amendment of 1911) applied. Having acquired an existing plant, which had been established under the authority of that provision, the company had extended its system so that, prior to October 10, 1911, it had many miles of mains and was serving upwards of 3,500 customers. Its plant had been established with a view to an increased demand for its service. Its situation, as disclosed by the petition, which was not traversed, was thus described by the state court: The petitioner 'shows that the works of said company were established and operated with the intent to supply gas in every section of the city, and to lay pipes in every street, if necessary for that purpose; that to this end it constructed works of a size sufficient to supply gas to a much larger territory than it was supplying prior to October 10, 1911, and had expended in so doing $100,000 more than would have been required for works to supply only the territory reached by its pipes at that date, that it had laid and maintained its pipes in many streets of the city, and had supplied gas thereby to, the inhabitants in such streets for more than two years before said date; that prior to said date, said company had made contracts with many of the inhabitants of the city to supply gas to them, that said contracts were still in force, and that, in order to perform them, it must extend its mains into streets not before used by it. All its works before that date were constructed in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution existing \n\n[233 U.S. 195, 201]\n\u00a0\n prior to said amendment, and in compliance with existing regulations and directions of the city authorities.' The petition also sets forth that by reason of the increased expense of construction of its plant, as above stated, it could not supply at a profit the territory contiguous to the streets actually used by it at the date of the amendment, and that to confine its service to that territory would entail upon the company a constant loss of more than $2,000 a month.\n It was further averred that on February 23, 1912, the company had applied to the board of public works for permission to excavate in the designated street, not theretofore occupied by it, for the purpose of extending its distributing system in accordance with the former provision of the Constitution, offering to comply with the general regulations of the city with respect to damages and indemnity for damages. The board informed the company that there were no general regulations on the subject with which it had complied, but that the company would not be permitted to open the street, or to lay its pipes therein, unless it first sought and obtained a franchise by purchase in accordance with the ordinance of October 26, 1911. Thereupon, the company notified the board that it would extend its mains at the time and place stated, and requested the board to direct and superintend the work. It was proceeding accordingly to open a trench for its mains when it was stopped by the arrest of the plaintiff in error.\n The supreme court of the state held that the constitutional amendment authorized the city to enact the ordinances in question and thus to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which franchises of the character described might thereafter be obtained and exercised. It was further decided that the grant under the former constitutional provision took effect only upon acceptance; that the only means whereby an effectual manifestation \n\n[233 U.S. 195, 202]\n\u00a0\n of acceptance could be made was the act of taking possession and occupying the street for the purpose allowed; and hence, that the vested right of the Economic Gas Company, at the time the Constitution was changed, went only so far as its actual occupancy and use of the streets then extended. Concluding, upon this ground, that the company had no authority to lay pipes in the new street in order to extend its service into new territory within the city, the petitioner was remanded to custody. 163 Cal. 677, 678, 681, 126 Pac. 875.\n It is at once apparent that the question thus raised does not concern the power of the city to supervise the execution of the work. That, as well as the authority to regulate rates, was expressly secured by the constitutional provision upon which the claim is founded. Nor does that provision permit the assertion of an exclusive franchise. The city may not only authorize others to compete, but it may compete itself. Madera Waterworks v. Madera, \n228 U.S. 454\n, 57 L. ed. 915, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 571.\n Within these recognized limits, the question remains as to the nature and extent of the right acquired by the company prior to the constitutional amendment,-a question which, in view of the appeal to the clause of the Federal Constitution prohibiting state legislation impairing the obligation of contracts, it is the duty of this court to determine for itself.

It could delegate to the municipality, or itself exercise, the power. Experience had produced the conviction that this authority was abused; that favoritism had fostered monopolies and restrained the competition that was then thought to be desirable. In order to terminate these \n\n[233 U.S. 195, 203]\n\u00a0\n evils, the unique plan was decided upon of making street franchises, for the purpose of supplying water and artificial light, the subject of direct grant by the Constitution itself without requiring any action on the part of the legislature to give it force. That this was the purpose and effect of  19 of article 11 of the Constitution of 1879 was decided by the supreme court of California in People v. Stephens, 62 Cal. 209, shortly after that Constitution was adopted. See also Pereria v. Wallace, 129 Cal. 397, 62 Pac. 61; Re Johnston, 137 Cal. 115, 69 Pac. 973; Denninger v. Recorder's Ct. 145 Cal. 629, 79 Pac. 360; Stockton Gas & Electric Co. v. San Joaquin County, 148 Cal. 313, 5 L.R.A.(N.S.) 174, 83 Pac. 54, 7 Ann. Cas. 511; South Pasadena v. Pasadena Land & Water Co. 152 Cal. 579, 93 Pac. 490.\n It is pointed out that the language of the provision was general both with respect to persons and to places; that it embraced all the cities in the state; and that it did not provide for any formal or written acceptance of the offer. But the lack of a requirement of an acceptance of a formal character did not preclude acceptance in fact. Nor did the generality of the provision with respect to all persons and cities make it impossible for particular persons to acquire rights thereunder in particular cities. It is clear that the offer was to be taken distributively with respect to municipalities. It referred to 'any city where there are no public works owned and controlled by the municipality for supplying the same with water or artificial light;' and when as to such a city the offer was accepted, the grant became as effective as if it had been made specially to the accepting individual or corporation. See Stanislaus County v. San Joaquin & K. River Canal & Irrig. Co. \n192 \nU.S. 201, 206\n, 48 S. L. ed. 406, 410, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 241.\n In the case of Re Johnston, 137 Cal. 115, 69 Pac. 973, the court said: 'In People v. Stephens, supra, the above section' (referring to  19 of article 11 'was construed by this court to be a direct grant from the people to the persons therein designated of the right to lay pipes in the \n\n[233 U.S. 195, 204]\n\u00a0\n streets of a city for the purposes specified, without waiting for legislative authority or being subject to any restrictions from that branch of the government. . . . The only limitations upon this privilege are those contained in the language in which it is granted,-viz., that the work shall be done 'under the direction of the superintendent of streets, or other officer in control thereof,' and 'under such general regulations as the municipality may prescribe for damages and indemnity for damages.\" As it was succinctly stated in Clark v. Los Angeles, 160 Cal. 30, 39, 116 Pac. 722: 'The express grant made by  19 is of the privilege, franchise, or easement to place in the public streets of a city the conduits necessary or convenient for the business of supplying light or power to the city and its inhabitants. It may be accepted by any person, or by any company duly incorporated to engage in that business.'\n When the voice of the state declares that it is bound if its offer is accepted, and the question simply is with respect to the scope of the obligation, we should be slow to conclude that only a revocable license was intended. Moreover, the provision plainly contemplated the establishment of a plant devoted to the described public service and an assumption of the duty to perform that service. That the grant, resulting from an acceptance of the state's offer, constituted a contract, and vested in the accepting individual or corporation a property right, protected by the Federal Constitution, is not open to dispute in view of the repeated decisions of this court.

It is not contended that the change in the Constitution could disturb the company's rights in the streets used previous to the amendment; but it is insisted that such actual user measured the range of the acceptance of the grant, and hence defined the limits of its operation.\n In support of this view, the established and salutary rule is invoked that public grants are to be construed strictly in favor of the public; that ambiguities are to be resolved against the grantee.

It has often been stated, as one of the reasons for the rule, that statutes and ordinances embodying such grants are usually drawn by interested parties, and that it serves to frustrate efforts through the skilful use of words to accomplish purposes which are not apparent upon the face of the enactment. Dubuque & P. R. Co. v. Litchfield, 23 How. 66, 88, 16 L. ed. 500, 509; Slidell v. Grandjean, \n111 \nU.S. 412, 437\n, 28 S. L. ed. 321, 329, 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 475; Blair v.

But it must also be recognized that this principle of construction does not deny to public offers a fair and reasonable interpretation, or justify the withholding of that which it satisfactorily appears the grant was intended to convey.

Here, the provision was presented by a constitutional convention for adoption by the people as the deliberate expression of the policy of the state in order to secure the benefits of competition in public service, and it will not be questioned that it must receive, as the state court said in People v. Stephens, 62 Cal. p. 233, 'a practical, common-sense construction.' \n\n[233 U.S. 195, 206]\n\u00a0\n There is no ambiguity as to the scope of the offer. It was not simply of a privilege to maintain pipes actually laid, but to lay pipes so far as they might be required in order to effect an adequate distribution. The privilege was defined as that 'of using the streets and thoroughfares thereof, and of laying down pipes and conduits therein, and connections therewith, so far as may be necessary for introducing into and supplying such city and its inhabitants either with gaslight, or other illuminating light, or with fresh water for domestic and all other purposes upon the condition that the municipal government shall have the right to regulate the charges thereof.'\n The breadth of the offer was commensurate with the requirements of the undertaking which was invited. The service to which the provision referred was a community service. It was the supply of a municipality- which had no municipal works-with water or light. This would involve, in the case of waterworks, the securing of sources of supply, the provision of conduits for conveying the water to the municipality, and the permanent investment in the construction of reservoirs with suitable storage capacity; and, in the case of gasworks, the establishment of a manufacturing plant on a scale large enough to meet the demands that could reasonably be anticipated. But waterworks and gasworks constructed to furnish a municipality with water or light would, of course, be useless without distributing systems; and the right of laying in the streets the mains needed to carry the water or gas to the inhabitants of the community was absolutely essential to the undertaking as a practical enterprise. This, the constitutional provision recognized. It was clearly designed to stop favoritism in granting such rights, not to withhold them. It is not to be supposed that it was expected that waterworks and gasworks of the character required to supply cities would be erected without grants of franchises to use the streets for laying the necessary \n\n[233 U.S. 195, 207]\n\u00a0\n distributing pipes. Bois e Artesian Hot & Cold Water Co. v. Bois e City, \n230 \nU.S. 84, 91\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1400, 1406, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 997. The scheme of the constitutional provision was not to make it impossible to secure such grants, or to restrict the street rights to be acquired, but, as already stated, to end the existing abuses by making these grants directly through the Constitution itself, instead of permitting them to be made by the legislature, or by municipalities acting under legislative authority. People v. Stephens, supra.\n In deciding upon the policy of making these direct grants it was for the state to determine their terms and their scope; it could have imposed whatever conditions it saw fit to impose. But it did not attempt to confine the privilege to particular streets or areas, or to make the laying of the necessary pipes conditional upon the renewal of the offer street by street, or foot by foot, as the pipes were put in the ground. The people of the state decided that local superintendence of the execution of the work, regulations and indemnity with respect to damages, and the continuing authority of the municipality to regulate rates, would be adequate protection. It was upon this basis that the state offered the privilege of laying pipes in the streets so far as might 'be necessary for introducing into and supplying such city and its inhabitants' either with water or light, as the case might be. The individual or corporation undertaking to supply the city with water or light was put in the same position as though such individual or corporation had received a special grant of the described street rights in the city which was to be served. Such a grant would not be one of several distinct and separate franchises. When accepted and acted upon it would become binding-not foot by foot, as pipes were laid, but as an entirety, in accordance with its purpose and express language. Grand Trunk Western R. Co. v. South Bend, \n227 \nU.S. 544, 555\n, 556 S., 57 L. ed. 633, 640, 641, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 405, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 303.\n It is urged that, in the absence of any provision for \n\n[233 U.S. 195, 208]\n\u00a0\n formal or written acceptance, the only way the offer could be accepted was by use of the streets, and that for this reason the rights of the company could not extend beyond the length of its pipes in place. But this is to say that the offer as made could not be accepted at all; that the right to lay pipes could not in any event be acquired. It is to assume, despite the explicit statement of the constitutional provision, that the investment in extensive plants-in the construction of reservoirs, and in the building of manufacturing works-was invited without any assurance that the laying of the distributing system could be completed, or that it could even be extended far enough to afford any chance of profit. It would be to deny the right offered, although essential to the efficacy of the enterprise, and in its place to give a restricted and inadequate right, which was unexpressed.\n In view of the nature of the undertaking in contemplation, and of the terms of the offer, we find no ground for the conclusion that each act of laying pipe was to constitute an acceptance pro tanto. We think that the offer was intended to be accepted in its entirety as made, and that acceptance lay in conduct committing the person accepting to the described service. The offer was made to the individual or corporation undertaking to serve the municipality, and when that service was entered upon and the individual or corporation had changed its position beyond recall, we cannot doubt that the offer was accepted. City R. Co. v. Citizens' Street R. Co. \n166 \nU.S. 557, 568\n, 41 S. L. ed. 1114, 1118, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 653; Grand Trunk Western R. Co. v. South Bend, supra. In this view, the grant embraced the right to lay the extensions that were needed in furnishing the supply within the city.\n This construction of the constitutional provision is the only one that is compatible with the existence of the duty which it was intended, as it seems to us, that the recipient of the state's grant should assume. The service, as has been said, was a community service. Incident to the \n\n[233 U.S. 195, 209]\n\u00a0\n undertaking in response to the state's offer was the obligation to provide facilities that were reasonably adequate. Lumbard v. Stearns, 4 Cush. 60; Cumberland Teleph. & Teleg. Co. v. Kelly, 87 C. C. A. 268, 160 Fed. 316, 324, 15 Ann. Cas. 1210; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. North Carolina Corp.

Corp.  1129. It would not be said that either a water company or a gas company, establishing its service under the constitutional grant, could stop its mains at its pleasure and withhold its supply by refusing to extend its distributing conduits so as to meet the reasonable requirements of the community. But this duty and the right to serve, embracing the right under the granted privilege to install the means of service, were correlative.\n In People ex rel. Woodhaven Gaslight Co. v. Deehan, 153 N. Y. 528, 533, 47 N. E. 787 (approved in Illinois C. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n176 \nU.S. 646, 666\n, 44 S. L. ed. 622, 629, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 509), a grant of authority to lay conduits for conveying gas through the streets of a town, so as to render service to the people of the town, was held to extend as a property right not only to the streets then existing, but to those subsequently opened. The court said: 'It is well known that business enterprises such as the relator is engaged in are based upon calculations of future growth and expansion. A franchise for supplying gas not only confers a privilege, but imposes an obligation upon the corporation to serve the public in a reasonable way. The relator is bound to supply gas to the people of the town upon certain conditions and under certain circumstances, and it would be most unjust to give such a construction to the consent as to disable it from performing its obligations. It cannot reasonably be contended that the relator is obliged to apply for a new grant whenever a new street is opened or an old one extended, as would be the case if the consent applied only to the situation existing when made. When the right to use the streets has been \n\n[233 U.S. 195, 210]\n\u00a0\n once granted in general terms to a corporation engaged in supplying gas for public and private use, such grant necessarily contemplates that new streets are to be opened and old ones extended from time to time, and so the privilege may be exercised in the new streets as well as in the old.'\n As to the question of fact, the present case presents no controversy. It was averred, and not denied, that the works of the gas company were established and operated with the intent to furnish gas throughout the city, wherever needed, and that this enterprise had been diligently prosecuted; that a large investment had been made in a plant which was adequate to supply a much greater territory than that reached by the distributing mains when the amendment of 1911 was adopted; that the expense of this installation made it impossible to supply at a profit the limited territory contiguous to the streets then actually occupied by the company; and that if it were confined in its service to that territory it would sustain a constant loss. The company, by its investment, had irrevocably committed itself to the undertaking, and its acceptance of the offer of the right to lay its pipes, so far as necessary to serve the municipality, was complete.\n We conclude that the constitutional amendment of 1911, and the municipal ordinances adopted in pursuance thereof, were ineffectual to impair this right, and that the company was entitled to extend its mains for the purpose of distributing its supply to the inhabitants of the city, subject to the conditions set forth in the constitutional provision as it stood before the amendment.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","190":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSAGE v. HAMPE(1914)\nNo. 82\nArgued: Decided: November 30, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 99, 100]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lee Monroe, Edwin A. Austin, W. S. Roark, and Carr W.

Thompson for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 99, 103]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action brought by the defendant in error (Hampe) to recover damages for breach of a contract to \n\n[235 U.S. 99, 104]\n\u00a0\n purchase certain land and to convey to the plaintiff certain other land of greater value. The answer alleges that the land to be conveyed by the defendant (Sage) was Indian land, not belonging to him, but allotted and patented to members of the Pottawatomie Tribe, under the act of Congress of February 8, 1887, chap. 119, 24 Stat. at L. 388. By  5 of that act any conveyance or contract touching such land within twenty-five years from the date of the allotment and trust patent was made null and void, and it is alleged that the period had not expired and had not been abrogated at the date of the contract. Evidence was offered to prove the facts alleged, but was excluded, subject to exception. It is unnecessary to set forth the contract more particularly, because, whatever doubts might be felt whether it was or could be shown to be a contract for specific land, the case was tried on the footing that it was such a contract, and the breach and the damages, so far as we can judge, both depended on that view. The supreme court of Kansas was of the same opinion, and held that, notwithstanding the character of the land contracted for and the statute, the defendant, being a stranger to the allotment, was bound by his contract so far as to be liable in damages at law. 87 Kan. 536, 125 Pac. 53.\n The defendant relied upon the act of Congress as a defense and is entitled to come to this court. Nutt v. Knut, \n200 U.S. 12\n, 50 L. ed. 348, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 216. With regard to that defense, no doubt it is true that a may may contract that a future event shall come to pass over which he has no, or only a limited, power. Globe Ref. Co. v. Landa Cotton Oil Co. \n190 \nU.S. 540, 545\n, 47 S. L. ed. 1171, 1173, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 754. And we assume in accordance with the decision of the Kansas courts that the principle applies to contracts for the conveyance of land that the contractor does not own. But that principle is not enough to dispose of the case, even if, subject to what we have to say hereafter, the universality of the invalidating language of the statute ('any contract') be confined to \n\n[235 U.S. 99, 105]\n\u00a0\n contracts by the owners of the land. A contract that on its face requires an illegal act, either of the contractor or a third person, no more imposes a liability to damages for nonperformance than it creates an equity to compel the contractor to perform. A contract that invokes prohibited conduct makes the contractor a contributor to such conduct. Kalem Co. v. Harper Bros. \n222 \nU.S. 55, 63\n, 56 S. L. ed. 92, 96, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 20; Ann. Cas. 1913A, 1285. And more broadly, it long has been recognized that contracts that obviously and directly tend in a marked degree to bring about results that the law seeks to prevent cannot be made the ground of a successful suit. Providence Tool Co. v. Norris, 2 Wall. 45, 17 L. ed. 868; Trist v. Child (Busk v. Child) 21 Wall. 441, 22 L. ed. 623; Oscanyan v. Winchester Repeating Arms Co. \n103 U.S. 261\n, 26 L. ed. 539; Fuller v. Dame, 18 Pick. 472. It appears to us that this is a contract of that class. It called for an act that could not be done at the time, and it tended to lead the defendant to induce the Indian owner to attempt what the law, for his own good, forbade. Such contracts, if upheld, might be made by parties nearly connected with the Indian, and strongly tend by indirection to induce him to deprive himself of rights that the laws seeks to protect.\n It is true that later statutes in force when the contract was made allowed a conveyance with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. Act of August 15, 1894, chap. 290, 28 Stat. at L. 286, 295. Act of May 31, 1900, chap. 598,  7, 31 Stat. at L. 221, 247. The Kansas court laid these statutes on one side, and in our view also they do not affect the case. The purpose of the law still is to protect the Indian interest, and a contract that tends to bring to bear improper influence upon the Secretary of the Interior, and to induce attempts to mislead him as to what the welfare of the Indian requires, are as contrary to the policy of the law as others that have been condemned by the courts. Kelly v. Harper, 7 Ind. Terr. 541, 104 S. W. 829. See Larson v. First Nat. Bank, 62 Neb. 303, 308, 87 N. W. 18. \n\n[235 U.S. 99, 106]\n\u00a0\n The only doubt open in the present position of the case is whether the ground upon which we hold the contract unenforceable is not a matter of common law, which we may think that the Kansas courts ought to apply, but which is not open to review here. The case at first sight seems like those in which a state decides to enforce or not to enforce a domestic contract notwithstanding or because of its tendency to cause a breach of the law of some other state. Graves v. Johnson, 176 Mass. 53, 88 Am. St. Rep. 355, 60 N. E. 383, 156 Mass. 211, 15 L.R.A. 834, 32 Am. St. Rep. 446, 30 N. E. 818. But the policy involved here is the policy of the United States. It is not a matter that the states can regard or disregard at their will. There can be no question that the United States can make its prohibitions binding upon others than Indians to the extent necessary effectively to carry its policy out, and therefore, as on the grounds that we have indicated, the contract contravenes the policy of the law, there is no reason why the law should not be read, if necessary, as broad enough to embrace it in terms.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","191":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSAN JOAQUIN & KINGS RIVER CANAL & IRRIGATION CO. v.

By a statute of March 12, 1885, the boards are authorized to fix these rates for their several counties, but so that the returns to the parties furnishing the water shall be not less than 6 per cent upon the value of the 'canals, ditches, flumes, chutes, and all other property actually used and useful to the appropriation and furnishing of such water.' The rates when fixed are binding for one year and until established anew or abrogated. The bill concerns rates fixed in 1907, and the question before the court has been narrowed to a single issue. If the plaintiff is entitled to 6 per cent upon its tangible property alone it is agreed that the orders must stand. But if the plaintiff has water rights that are to be taken into account, the rates fixed will fall short of giving it what it is entitled to and must be set aside. The circuit court dismissed the bill (191 Fed. 875), and on this appeal figures are immaterial, the only question being whether the principle adopted is right. \n\n[233 U.S. 454, 459]\n\u00a0\n It was suggested, to be sure, at the argument, that it does not appear that the plaintiff offered any evidence as to water rights at the hearing before the supervisors, and therefore that it ought not to be allowed to complain now that nothing was allowed for them. But this evidently is an afterthought. In general, a party may wait until a law is passed or regulation is made, and then insist upon his constitutional rights. Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co. \n211 \nU.S. 210, 227\n, 229 S., 53 L. ed. 150, 159, 160, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 67. This we understand to be the view of the California courts as to these very boards. Spring Valley Waterworks v. San Francisco, 82 Cal. 286, 315, 6 L.R.A. 756, 16 Am. St. Rep. 116, 22 Pac. 910, 1046; San Diego Water Co. v. San Diego, 118 Cal. 558, 564, 38 L. R.A. 460, 62 Am. St. Rep. 261, 50 Pac. 633. Moreover, as the defendants contend that the plaintiff is entitled to no compensation for water rights, to offer evidence would have been an idle form.\n It is not disputed that the plaintiff has a right as against riparian proprietors to withdraw the water that it distributes through its canals. Whether the right was paid for, as the plaintiff says, or not, it has been confirmed by prescription and is now beyond attack. It is not disputed, either, that if the plaintiff were the owner of riparian lands to which its water was distributed, it would have a property in the water that could not be taken without compensation. But it is said that as the plaintiff appropriates this water to distribution and sale, it thereby dedicates it to public use under California law, and so loses its private right in the same. It appears to us that when the cases cited for this proposition are pressed to the conclusion reached in the present case, they are misapplied. No doubt it is true that such an appropriation and use of the water entitles those within reach of it to demand the use of a reasonable share on payment. It well may be true that if the waters were taken for a superior use by eminent domain those whose lands were irrigated would be compensated for the loss. But even if the rate paid is not to be determined as upon a purchase of water from the plain- \n\n[233 U.S. 454, 460]\n\u00a0\n tiff, still, at the lowest, the plaintiff has the sole right to furnish this water, the owner of the irrigated lands cannot get it except through the plaintiff's help, and it would be unjust not to take that fact into account in fixing the rates. We are not called upon to decide what the rate shall be, or even the principle by which it shall be measured. But it is proper to add a few words.\n The declaration in the Constitution of 1879 that water appropriated for sale is appropriated to a public use must be taken according to its subject-matter. The use is not by the public at large, like that of the ocean for sailing, but by certain individuals for their private benefit respectively. Thayer v. California Development Co. 164 Cal. 117, 128, 128 Pac. 21; Fallbrook Irrig. Dist. v. Bradley, \n164 \nU.S. 112, 161\n, 41 S. L. ed. 369, 389, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 56. The declaration, therefore, does not necessarily mean more than that the few within reach of the supply may demand it for a reasonable price. The roadbed of a railroad is devoted to a public use in a stricter sense, yet the title of the railroad remains, and the use, though it may be demanded, must be paid for. In this case it is said that a part of the water was appropriated before the Constitution went into effect, and that a suit now is pending to condemn more as against a riparian proprietor, for which, of course, the plaintiff must pay. It seems unreasonable to suppose that the Constitution meant that if a party, instead of using the water on his own land, as he may, sees fit to distribute it to others, he loses the rights that he has bought or lawfully acquired. Recurring to the fact that in every instance only a few specified individuals get the right to a supply, and that it clearly appears from the latest statement of the supreme court of California ( Palmer v. Railroad Commission, January 20, 1914 [-- Cal. --, 138 Pac, 997]) that the water when appropriated is private property, it is unreasonable to suppose that the constitutional declaration meant to compel a gift from the former owner to the users, and that in \n\n[233 U.S. 454, 461]\n\u00a0\n dealing with water 'appropriated for sale' it meant that there should be nothing to sell.

The plaintiff got a verdict and judgment which the supreme court of the territory affirmed. 16 N. M. 434, 120 Pac. 316.\n The only argument addressed to us is an attack upon the jurisdiction of the court that tried the case. That court was the district court, sitting for the trial of causes arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States in the first judicial district in the territory of New Mexico. The organic act of September 9, 1850, chap. 49, 9 Stat. at L. 446, provided in  10 for three judicial districts, and for a district court to be held in each by a jus- \n\n[232 U.S. 694, 699]\n\u00a0\n tice of the supreme court, as should be prescribed by law. It further enacted that the jurisdiction of the several courts therein provided for 'shall be as limited by law;' that 'each of the said district courts shall have and exercise the same jurisdiction in all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States as is vested in the circuit and district courts of the United States;' and that the first six days of every term, or so much of them as necessary, 'shall be appropriated to the trial of causes arising under the said Constitution and laws.' See also Rev. Stat.  1910. The court where the trial was held was one of these district courts provided for by the organic act, and the case was one arising under the laws of the United States.\n But it is said that the jurisdiction of these courts was to be 'as limited by law;' that that means by territorial legislation, and that a territorial statute provided for the holding of district courts in the counties, and enacted that the district courts in the counties should have 'exclusive original jurisdiction in all civil cases which shall not be cognizable before probate judges and justices of the peace.' Comp. Laws 1897,  900. By a later territorial act the district courts in the various counties were given 'jurisdiction in all civil causes in said counties which, according to law, belong to the district courts,' id.  901. And this was in pursuance not only of the organic act, but of another act of Congress of 1858 [11 Stat. at L. 366, chap. 166], afterwards Rev. Stat.  1874, by which the judges of the supreme court were 'authorized to hold court within their respective districts, in the counties wherein, by the laws of the territory, courts have been or may be established, for the purpose of hearing and determining all matters and causes, except those in which the United States is a party.' Thus, it is argued, exclusive jurisdiction of cases like the present was transferred to the county district courts. \n\n[232 U.S. 694, 700]\n\u00a0\n But it has been held for many years that the purpose and effect of these statutes was to give the judges of the supreme court sitting in the county district courts authority to hear cases arising under territorial laws, and to make the jurisdiction over such cases exclusive in those courts.

The statutes, we believe, have not been understood to attempt to withdraw from the courts of the larger districts the authority expressly conferred upon them by the Revised Statutes and the organic act,-a thing that, of course, territorial statutes could not do.

Broyles de- \n\n[234 U.S. 64, 66]\n\u00a0\n faulted; the other defendants answered, alleging in substance that they had signed the notes for Broyles's accommodation, and had been induced to sign by the fraudulent representations of the bank. Upon the trial, the motion of the plaintiff for a direction of a verdict was granted as against all the defendants except Lewis, and as to him the plaintiff was permitted to take a nonsuit. The judgment on the verdict was affirmed by the supreme court of the territory. 16 N. M. 414, 120 Pac. 670.\n Several questions of pleading and practice are presented, but, in view of their local character, we accept, as to these, the rulings of the territorial court. Phoenix R.

We shall therefore assume that the complaint was sufficient; and that the defenses of alteration, the unauthorized filling of blanks, and the failure to credit certain payments, were not available because not suitably pleaded. The supreme court of the territory also held that although both parties had requested peremptory instructions, the defendants were entitled, upon the denial of their motion, to ask that the case be submitted to the jury, and that this request was properly made. See Empire State Cattle Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. \n210 U.S. 1\n, 52 L. ed. 931, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 607, 15 Ann. Cas. 70.\n The question before us, then, is whether, in view of the state of the evidence upon the defense that the notes were procured by fraud, the trial court erred in directing a verdict for the plaintiff. It is apparent that there was evidence sufficient to go to the jury that the signatures of some of the defendants had been obtained by means of fraudulent representations. Upon this point, the supreme court of the territory said: 'The defense, as we have seen, was principally that the signing of the notes was procured by fraud. There was undoubtedly evidence that the defnedants Anderson' (impleaded as Pratt), 'Evans, Brown, and Lewis were told by plaintiff's repre- \n\n[234 U.S. 64, 67]\n\u00a0\n sentative prior to signing the notes that Broyles was solvent, and were further told that plaintiff had ample collateral for the notes, and there was also evidence from which the jury might have concluded that the defendants signed the notes in reliance upon these representations. We find also upon the record room for a conclusion by the jury, that these statements were untrue, and that they were known when made to be untrue. Indeed, the trial court recognized this, for as to Lewis, in whose favor the testimony on this point was no stronger than on behalf of Anderson, Evans, and Brown, the court held that the matter was one for the jury.' Notwithstanding this estimate of the evidence, the court sustained the recovery against the last-named defendants, holding that, as they were liable upon former notes for the same amount, which were renewed by the notes in suit, the defense was not available. It was said that, even assuming the notes in suit to have been given 'as the result of a wilful misrepresentation,' the defendants, being bound by the former notes, were 'held to no greater duty than previously rested upon them,' and hence could not defend upon the ground that they were induced to sign the notes by fraudulent representations.\n We are unable to agree with this conclusion. The question was not one of a recovery of damages in deceit. Ming v. Woolfolk, folk, \n116 \nU.S. 599, 602\n, 603 S., 29 L. ed. 740, 741, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 489. If there was fraud, it vitiated the transatction, and the plaintiff could not avail itself of its own wrong by enforcing the notes. The fact that the three defendants, Anderson, Evans, and Brown, were liable on the former notes, did not place them under any legal obligation whatever to make the notes in suit. It appeared that the former notes were signed by Broyles, Anderson, Evans, and Brown; the last three being in effect sureties for Broyles; and as the court states, 'upon the giving of the present notes, these former notes were surrendereed by plaintiff bank and destroyed.' On the new notes Lewis, Schmidt & Story, and Crossman were addi- \n\n[234 U.S. 64, 68]\n\u00a0\n tional makers and in effect new cosureties. Not only was there new paper, but the legal position of Anderson, Evans, and Brown was materially changed. Broyles was discharged from liability on the old notes, and, with respect to the new, there were six (treating the firm of Schmidt & Story as one) in the position of cosureties instead of three. No one of the three defendants in question who were parties to the original paper could pay it and hold the other two to their original measure of contribution. The new notes constituted new promises with distinct legal consequences. It is clear that the plaintiff could not enforce them if they were fraudulently induced.\n There was no evidence of fraudulent representations to the defendants Schmidt & Story and Crossman, but they contend that they are not bound if their comakers were relieved from liability by reason of the plaintiff's fraud. Reference is made to  55 of the negotiable instruments act, Laws of 1907 (N. M.) chap. 83, which provides: 'The title of a person who negotiates an instrument is defective within the meaning of this act when he obtained the instrument or any signature thereto, by fraud, duress, or force and fear, or other unlawful means, for an illegal consideration, or when he negotiates it in breach of faith, or under such circumstances as amount to a fraud.' It has been held by the supreme court of Wisconsin, in construing the same language in the Wisconsin act, that if one of the signatures of several comakers is obtained by fraud, the defense is also available to the other makers, since the equality of burden is disturbed. Hodge v. Smith, 130 Wis. 326, 110 N. W. 192; Aukland v. Arnold, 131 Wis. 64, 66, 67, 111 N. W. 212. In the case last cited the court said, referring to Hodge v. Smith, supra: 'It was there held that the title of a person who negotiates commercial paper is defective when he has obtained any signature thereto by fraud, and that if the party so defrauded be relieved from liability thereon, then such fraud makes such paper void- \n\n[234 U.S. 64, 69]\n\u00a0\n able by all the other persons who signed it, though they did not participate in and were ignorant of such fraudulent conduct at the time they signed it. This conclusion was reached upon the ground that, when several persons assume such an obligation, it is material and important that all who join as makers should share equally in bearing the burden of its payment, and if, through the fraud of the person holding it, such equality of burden is disturbed and the burden increased as to some of the persons signing it, such fraud renders the title defective as to all of the persons who signed it.' While this construction of the statute was apparently accepted, it was held that the defense was not open to Schmidt & Story and Crossman for the reason that they signed the notes several days before the signatures of the other defendants upon whom the fraud was practised were obtained, and that there was no evidence in the record 'as to whether the defendants Schmidt, Story, and Crossman, or any of them had any knowledge that there were to be any other signers than themselves.' Accordingly, it was said that, so far as the record showed, the notes were 'complete and binding obligations' upon these defendants at the time they executed the same, and that fraud in obtaining the signatures of the subsequent cosigners would not affect the equality of the burden they had assumed.\n This, as it seems to us, is not an adequate answer to the defendants' contention. It is true that these defendants have endeavored to maintain that the notes were altered by the addition of the other signatures, relying upon negotiable instruments law,  125. See Dan. Neg. Inst.  1387. But the supreme court of the territory ruled that under the pleadings this defense was not available and could not be considered. The plaintiff could not maintain this position and at the same time defeat the defense of fraud upon the ground that the notes were complete instruments, and as such had become the binding \n\n[234 U.S. 64, 70]\n\u00a0\n obligations of these defendants before the others signed. Taking the notes as they stood upon the pleadings and proof, we think that these defendants ( Schmidt & Story and Crossman) must be regarded as comakers with the other defendants, to whom the representations are said to have been made, and it follows that if any of the signatures of these comakers were obtained by fraud, the equality of burden was altered. The plaintiff's fraud, assuming it to have been committed, changed the legal effect of the promise of these defendants. For these reasons we think that they were entitled to have the evidence as to fraudulent representation submitted to the jury, and that the direction of the verdict in favor of the plaintiff was error.\n The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Supreme Court of the State of New Mexico for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","194":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHUYLER v. LITTLEFIELD(1914)\nNo. 213\nArgued: January 29, 1914Decided: March 23, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 707, 708]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. W. Benton Crisp and Theodore M.

The proceeding is by Schuyler, Chadwick, & Burnham, to recover trust funds which they claim to have traced into the possession of Brown & Company's trustee in bankruptcy. The case involves an application of the rule that where one has deposited trust funds in his individual bank account, and the mingled fund is at any time wholly depleted, the trust fund is thereby dissipated, and cannot be treated as reappearing in sums subsequently deposited to the credit of the same account. Knatchbull v. Hallett, L. R. 13 Ch. Div. 696, 49 L. J. Ch. N. S. 415, 42 L. T. N. S. 421, 28 Week. Rep. 732; Peters v. Bain, \n133 U.S. 671\n (1), 693, 33 L. ed. 696, 704, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 354; Crawford County v. Strawn, 15 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1100, 84 C. C. A. 553, 157 Fed. 49, 54.\n There is no controversy about the law, but a complete disagreement about matters of fact where it is necessary to decide with certainty, on the one hand, the exact time and order in which a series of checks were deposited; and, on the other, to determine, with equal certainty, the exact order in which a series of checks drawn on that account were paid and what use was made of the money so drawn. As the bankruptcy occurred on August 25, 1908, and as the testimony was taken several months later, it is not surprising that the witnesses were not able to establish definitely the order in which these transactions took place, nor that the referee, district judge, and court of appeals each differed from the other as to what had been proved. The referee found that Schuyler, Chadwick, & Burnham had traced their funds into the hands of the trustee, and were therefore entitled to recover. The district judge agreed with the referee in this conclusion, but disagreed with him as to some of the findings of fact \n\n[232 U.S. 707, 711]\n\u00a0\n on which that conclusion was based. The circuit court of appeals disagreed with both, and held that the trust fund had not been traced into the hands of the trustee, and thereupon dismissed the complaint. The appeal from that degree involves a consideration of the facts, which may be thus briefly stated:\n Brown & Company were brokers in New York city, and on August 24th, 1908, by false representations of solvency obtained from Schuyler, Chadwick, & Burnham, 300 shares of Interborough stock (worth $32 per share ), agreeing at once to send in payment a check for $9,600, capable of certification. This was not done, and in spite of repeated demands the check was not delivered until after banking hours on August 24th, and too late to have it certified that day. In the meantime Brown & Company sold to Miller the\n 300 shares Interborough, for $ 9,600 1000 shares Northern Pacific 143,000 1000 shares Great Northern 137,000 ___ Total $289,600\n Miller thereupon gave Brown & Company a check for $266,600, which was deposited in the Hanover National Bank on August 24. Miller retained the balance of $23,000 on some claim which was not admitted by Brown & Company. They later that day obtained from Miller a check for $23,000, which was deposited in the bank the next morning, but after the bank had refused to pay or certify the Schuyler, Chadwick, & Burnham check for $9,600.\n It thus appeared that the stock fraudulently obtained by Brown & Company had been sold by them, with other stock, to Miller, who paid for the whole in two checks,-one for $266,600 deposited to Brown & Company's account in the Hanover National Bank on August 24th, and another for $23, 000, deposited in the same bank on August 25th.\n\n 1. \nIf the trust fund of $9,600 was included in the check \n\n[232 U.S. 707, 712]\n\u00a0\n for $266,600, then it was dissipated except to the extent of $6,180.17, which was the sum left to Brown & Company's credit at the close of business on August 24th. And inasmuch as all of that balance was paid out early the next day, the trust fund was thereby wholly dissipated so far as the bank account was concerned.\n If, however, the trust fund of $9,600 is to be treated as having been included in Miller's check for $23,000, then a similar result follows, though on this point the evidence of the witnesses and the findings of the two courts are in conflict. The controlling question was whether the $23, 000 had been deposited before or after the payment of a check for $146,000 which absorbed the whole amount then in bank. We see no reason to disturb the finding of the circuit court of appeals that the check for $23,000 was deposited soon after the bank opened on August 25th, and that it, with other money deposited during the morning, was used at about 11:30 A. M. to pay this check for $146,000 given by Brown & Company to Combs & Company. The payment of this large sum depleted the account and dissipated the trust fund in bank.\n\n 2. \nThe appellants, however, presented their case in a double aspect. They contended that even if the trust fund of $9,600 was checked out of the bank, they are able to trace the fund into stocks that subsequently came into the hands of the trustee in bankruptcy. This was based on the claim that out of the proceeds of the Miller checks, Brown & Company had paid notes due to the bank, and thereby released collateral which ultimately came into the possession of the trustee.\n But the record fails to show when the $266,600 was deposited, and it also fails to show with the requisite certainty the particular use made by Brown & Company of that money. The banking transactions on August 24th involved several millions of dollars. Money was deposited by Brown & Company in the bank, and money was borrowed by \n\n[232 U.S. 707, 713]\n\u00a0\n Brown & Company from the bank. Part of the loans were deposited to their bank account, and a part, represented by cashier's checks, did not appear in that account. Money was paid by Brown & Company to outsiders and to the bank. Payments to the bank were made on account of notes, some of which represented loans appearing in the deposit account, and others represented loans which had not been so entered. Some of the loans were secured and others were unsecured, and whether the money received from Miller (which included the trust fund of $9,600) was used to pay the secured or unsecured loans does not appear with certainty.\n It would serve no useful purpose to make a detailed statement of the testimony. The evidence has been fully discussed by the court of appeals ( 113 C. C. A. 348-357, 193 Fed. 24-33) in considering this claim of appellants along with that of several other parties seeking, on somewhat similar facts, to trace trust funds into the bank, and thence into collateral which ultimately came into the hands of the trustee. All these claims were disallowed because of the failure to make the requisite proof. Our investigation of the facts leads us to the same conclusion so far as concerns the appellants' claim. They were practically asserting title to $ 9,600, said to have been traced into stock in the possession of the trustee. Like all other persons similarly situated, they were under the burden of proving their title. If they were unable to carry the burden of identifying the fund as representing the proceeds of their Interborough stock, their claim must fail. If their evidence left the matter of identification in doubt, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the trustee, who represents all of the creditors of Brown & Company, some of whom appear to have suffered in the same way. Like them, the appellants must be remitted to the general fund.\n The decree is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","195":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCOTTEN v.

This case is submitted on the motion of appellee to dismiss, affirm, or place on the summary docket. The appellants filed a petition for reclamation in the bankruptcy court, which concerned, among other stocks, three hundred shares of United States Steel stock, which are now the subject-matter of this controversy. On April 20, 1911, the district court confirmed the report of the master, and entered an order dismissing the petitions of appellants and of some other claimants. Appellants appealed to the circuit court of appeals, and that court affirmed the district court (115 C. C. A. 348, 193 Fed. 24). The case then came to this court, and the judgment of the court of appeals was affirmed ( \n226 U.S. 110\n). On August 4, 1913, the bill of review with which the present proceeding is concerned was filed in the district court. This was more than two years after the original order in the district court, dismissing the reclamation proceeding, was made. The district court dismissed the bill of review (213 Fed. 701). That decree was affirmed in the circuit court of appeals (213 Fed. 705). Then the case was appealed here.\n Both courts below put their decisions on the ground that the appeal to the circuit court of appeals from the original order of the district court in the reclamation proceedings really involved the claim for the United States Steel stock in its present aspect, and that if not presented to the court of appeals when there on appeal it could not be held back and made the subject of a bill of review, as is now attempted to be done. We think this decision was clearly right. Furthermore, the ground alleged for the bill of review now is, that the principles which determined the disposition of the Gorman Case, \n229 U.S. 19\n (decided May 26, 1913, a little more than two years after the decree in the district court), reversing \n\n[235 U.S. 407, 411]\n\u00a0\n the circuit court of appeals in the same case (99 C. C. A. 345, 175 Fed. 769), would, had they been applied in this case, have required a different result in the district court in dealing with the original petition in reclamation, so far as the three hundred shares of the United States Steel stock, pledged with the Hanover National Bank, are concerned.\n Bills of review are on two grounds: first, error of law apparent on the face of the record without further examination of matters of fact; second, new facts discovered since the decree, which should materially affect the decree and probably induce a different result. 2 Bates, Fed. Eq. Proc. 762; 2 Street, Fed. Eq. Pr.  2151\n\n\n If the decision in the Gorman Case would have required a different result if the principles upon which it was decided had been applied in the original proceeding, which we do not find it necessary to decide, such subsequent decision will not lay the foundation for a bill of review for errors of law apparent, or for new matter in pais discovered since the decree, and probably requiring a different result.

Douglass for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 492, 495]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n Horton sued the Seaboard Air Line Railway in the superior court of Wake county, North Carolina, to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by him while in defendant's employ as a locomotive engineer. The action was brought under the Federal employers' liability act of April 22, 1908 (35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1322), as amended April 5, 1910 (36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1324). In the complaint it was sufficiently averred that defendant was a corporation operating a line of railway as a common carrier in interstate commerce, and that plaintiff, at the time he was injured, was employed by defendant in such commerce. These facts were not in issue at the trial.\n As to the circumstances of the occurrence of the injury, plaintiff's evidence tended to show that on July 27, 1910, defendant's locomotive engine No. 752 was placed in his charge; that it was equipped with a Buckner water gauge, a device attached to the boiler head for the purpose of showing the level of the water in the boiler, and consisting of a brass frame or case inclosing a thin glass tube which communicated with the boiler above and below in such manner that the tube received water and steam direct from the boiler and under the full boiler pressure. In order to shield the engineer from injury in case of the bursting of the tube, a piece of ordinary glass, 2 or 3 inches wide, 8 or 9 inches long, and about half an inch thick, known as a guard glass, should have been provided, this being a part of the regular equipment of the Buckner water gauge. There were slots for receiving the guard glass and holding it in position in front of the water tube. At each end of the tube, valves were provided for the purpose of disconnect- \n\n[233 U.S. 492, 496]\n\u00a0\n ing it from the boiler. As an alternative but probably less convenient method of determining the level of the water in the boiler, ordinary gauge cocks were provided.\n Plaintiff was an experienced locomotive engineer, and, according to his own testimony, was fully aware of the function of the guard glass and of its importance to his safety. He testified that when he took the engine out on his first trip on July 27th, he observed that the guard glass was missing; that on his return upon the following day he reported this to defendant's roundhouse foreman, to whom reports of such defects were properly made, and asked him for a guard glass; that the foreman stated there were none in stock at that place, and it would be necessary to send to a distance to get one; that he would do this, and that plaintiff should meanwhile run the engine without one; and that, having ineffectually endeavored to get a guard glass from another source, plaintiff proceeded to drive the engine with the use of the unguarded water gauge until August 4th, when the glass exploded and flying fragments struck him in the face, causing the injuries upon which his claim for damages was based.\n Defendant's evidence tended to show that when the engine was placed in plaintiff's charge on July 27th the water glass was in good condition, with a guard glass in place; that the gauge cocks were likewise in good working order; that it was the duty of a locomotive engineer to inspect his engine and know that it was in proper order before taking it out, and if not in proper order to make a written report to the roundhouse foreman, specifying the defects; that if anything should happen to the water glass it was the engineer's duty to close the valves so as to exclude the steam pressure from it, and run the engine with the gauge cocks, and that these were sufficient for the purpose; and that plaintiff made repeated reports in writing between July 27 and the time of his injury, mentioning other things needed about his engine, but making no mention of the \n\n[233 U.S. 492, 497]\n\u00a0\n water gauge or the guard glass. The fireman testified specifically that when plaintiff took charge of the engine on the morning of the 27th the water glass had the shield or guard in front of it, but that it was smoky, so that one could not see through it; that he, the fireman, in the presence of plaintiff, removed the guard glass in order to clean it; and that in plaintiff's presence it became broken. The roundhouse foreman specifically denied plaintiff's testimony about the complaint and the promise of reparation.\n Under instructions presently to be noticed, the case was submitted to the jury upon three issues, to which responses were made as follows:\n\n\n (1)\n Was plaintiff injured by defendant's negligence? Answer, Yes.\n\n\n (2)\n If so, did plaintiff assume the risk of injury? Answer, No.\n\n\n (3)\n Did plaintiff by his own negligence contribute to his injury? Answer, Yes.\n The jury also assessed substantial damages, for which judgment was rendered by the trial court, and upon appeal the supreme court affirmed the judgment (162 N. C. 424, -- L.R.A.(N.S.) -- 78 S. E. 494). The case comes here, under  237, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 227], upon questions arising out of instructions given and refused to be given to the jury as to the nature of the duty of the employer and the rules respecting assumption of risk and contributory negligence under the Federal employers' liability act.\n There is a motion to dismiss, upon the ground that no return day is specified in the writ of error or citation. Carroll v. Dorsey (1857) 20 How. 204, 207, 15 L. ed. 803, 804, and Sea v. Connecticut Mut. L. Ins. Co. ( 1880) \n154 U.S. 659\n, and 25 L. ed. 882, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1191, are relied upon. These decisions were based upon  22 of the judiciary act of September 24, 1789, 1 Stat. at L. 84, chap. 20, which was held to require a certain return day to be specified in the writ of error. Accordingly, general rule \n\n[233 U.S. 492, 498]\n\u00a0\n 33, promulgated December terms, 1867 (6 Wall. vi.), afterwards found as clause 5 of rule 8 of the revised rules promulgated January 7, 1884 (\n108 U.S. 577\n, 20 L. ed. 902, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. vii.), required that the writ of error and citation should be returnable on the first day of the term in cases where final judgment was rendered more than thirty days before that day, and on the third Monday of the term in cases where judgment was rendered less than thirty days before the first day. Blatchf, U. S. Ct. Rules 77. But under Blatchf. U. S. Ct. Rules 77. But under (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 684), the court, on January 26, 1891, amended clause 5 of rule 8 so as to read: 'All appeals, writs of error, and citations must be made returnable not exceeding thirty days from the day of signing the citation, whether the return day fall in vacation or in term time, and be served before the return day' (\n137 U.S. 710\n, 34 L. ed. 1122, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. iii.). And in the present rule as promulgated December 22, 1911 (222 U. S. p. 14, Appx. 56 L. ed. 1297, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. vii.), the same language is retained, with an exception extending the time to sixty days in writs of error and appeals from the western states, and Alaska, Hawaii, and Porto Rico, and to 120 days as to the Philippine Islands. An extension of the time in favor of the more distant states and territories was first introduced as clause 3 of original rule 63, promulgated at December term, 1853 (16 How. ix. 14 L. ed. 818), and has been continued, with amendments, until the present time (21 How. viii.; 2 Wall. viii.; \n108 U.S. 578\n, 20 L. ed. 903, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. viii.). It has, however, no bearing upon the form of the writ or citation, aside from the limit of time that may be allowed between date and return.\n The present writ of error and citation were dated the 4th day of August, 1913, and in terms were returnable 'within thirty days from the date hereof.' This form has been usually employed, with the approval of the court, since the amendment of the rule made in 1891, as mentioned. It is a substantial compliance with the present \n\n[233 U.S. 492, 499]\n\u00a0\n rule, and tends to avoid errors that otherwise might be made in inserting a day certain as a return day.\n This motion must therefore be denied.\n A second motion to dismiss, based upon grounds still more technical, and which need not be particularly stated, will likewise be denied.\n There is a further motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, upon the ground that no right, privilege, or immunity under the employers' liability act was especially set up or claimed in the state court of last resort and by that court denied. But since that court sustained the trial court ino overruling certain contentions made by plaintiff in error asserting a construction of the act, which, if acceded to, would presumably have produced a verdict in its favor, and consequent immunity from the action, this motion must be denied, upon the authority of St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. McWhirter, \n229 U.S. 265\n, 57 L. ed. 1179, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 858.\n Coming now to the merits, we need consider only certain assignments of error that are based upon exceptions to the action of the trial judge in giving and refusing to give instructions relating to the issues of defendant's negligence, the assumption of risk, and contributory negligence.\n At the outset we observe that the judge evidently misapprehended the effect of the Federal act upon state legislation. Thus, the jury was told that plaintiff had brought the action under the Federal statute; 'And where Congress enacts a law within the limits of its power, that law should be enforced uniformly throughout the entire United States. If it is in conflict with the state law, the state law is superseded. But where there is no conflict expressed by the statute of the United States, then the rule of the state prevails.' This, of course, in the absence of a specific statement of the applicable rule of the state law, might be treated as academic. But the theory \n\n[233 U.S. 492, 500]\n\u00a0\n was carried into the specific instructions, to the extent that upon the questions of the employer's duty and the assumption of risk by the employee, the charge was modeled rather upon the North Carolina statute than upon the act of Congress. By  2646, N. C. Revisal of 1905, 'Any servant or employee of any railroad company operating in this state who shall suffer injury to his person, or the personal representative of any such servant or employee who shall have suffered death in the course of his services or employment with such company by the negligence, carelessness, or incompetence of any other servant, employee, or agent of the company, or by any defect in the machinery, ways, or applicances of the company, shall be entitled to maintain an action against such company. Any contract or agreement, expressed or implied, made by any employee of such company to waive the benefit of this section, shall be null and void.'\n Upon the issue of defendant's negligence, the trial court charged the jury as follows: 'It is the duty of the defendant to provide a reasonably safe place for the plaintiff to work, and to furnish him with reasonably safe appliances with which to do his work.' And in various other forms the notion was expressed that the duty of defendant was absolute with respect to the safety of the place of work and of the appliances for the work. Thus: 'If you find from the evidence that it [the locomotive engine] was turned over to him without the guard, and if you further find from the evidence that the guard was a proper safety provision for the use of that gauge, and that it was unsafe without it, then the defendant did not furnish him a safe place and a safe appliance to do his work, and if it remained in that condition it was continuing negligence on the part of the defendant, and if he was injured in consequence thereof, if you so find by the greater weight of the evidence, you should answer the first issue, 'Yes.\" \n\n[233 U.S. 492, 501]\n\u00a0\n In these instructions the trial judge evidently adopted the same measure of responsibility respecting the character and safe condition of the place of work, and the appliances for the doing of the work, that is prescribed by the local statute. But it is settled that since Congress, by the act of 1908, took possession of the field of the employer's liability to employees in interstate transportation by rail, all state laws upon the subject are superseded. Second Employers' Liability Cases (Mondou v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co.) \n223 \nU.S. 1, 55\n, 56 S. L. ed. 327, 348, 38 L.R.A.(N. S.) 44, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 169, 1 N. C. C. A. 875.\n The act is quoted in full in that case at p. 6. By its 1st section a right of action is conferred (under conditions specified) for injury or death of the employee 'resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier, or by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, works, boats, wharves, or other equipment.'\n This clause has two branches; the one covering the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of the carrier, which has the effect of abolishing in this class of cases the common-law rule that exempted the employer from responsibility for the negligence of a fellow employee of the plaintiff; and the other relating to defects and insufficiencies in the cars, engines, appliances, etc. But, plainly, with respect to the latter as well as the former ground of liability, it was the intention of Congress to base the action upon negligence only, and to exclude responsibility of the carrier to its employees for defects and insufficiencies not attributable to negligence. The common-law rule is that an employer is not a guarantor of the safety of the place of work or of the machinery and appliances of the work; the extent of its duty to its employees is to see that ordinary care and prudence are exercised, to the end that the place in which the work is to be performed and the tools and appliances of the work \n\n[233 U.S. 492, 502]\n\u00a0\n may be safe for the workmen. Hough v. Texas & P. R. Co. \n100 \nU.S. 213, 217\n, 25 S. L. ed. 612, 615; Washington & G. R. Co. v. McDade, \n135 \nU.S. 554, 570\n, 34 S. L. ed. 235, 241, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1044; Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. McDade, \n191 \nU.S. 64, 67\n, 48 S. L. ed. 96, 100, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 24, 15 Am. Neg. Rep. 230. To hold that under the statute the railroad company is liable for the injury or death of an employee resulting from any defect or insufficiency in its cars, engines, appliances, etc., however caused, is to take from the act the words 'due to its negligence.' The plain effect of these words is to condition the liability upon negligence; and had there been doubt before as to the common-law rule, certainly the act now limits the responsibility of the company as indicated. The instructions above quoted imposed upon the employer an absolute responsibility for the safe condition of the appliances of the work, instead of limiting the responsibility to the exercise of reasonable care. In effect, the jury was instructed that the absence of the guard glass was conclusive evidence of defendant's negligence. In this there was error.\n The questions more particularly discussed, however, and upon which the decision seems to have turned in the supreme court of North Carolina, pertain to the issues of assumption of risk and contributory negligence. By  3 of the act of 1908 it is declared that 'the fact that the employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery, but the damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to such employee: Provided, that no such employee who may be injured or killed shall be held to have been guilty of contributory negligence in any case where the violation by such common carrier of any statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury or death of such employee.' And by  4, 'Such employee shall not be held to have assumed the risks of his employment in any case where the violation by such common carrier of any statute enacted for \n\n[233 U.S. 492, 503]\n\u00a0\n the safety of employees contributed to the injury or death of such employee.'\n By the phrase 'any statute enacted for the safety of employees,' Congress evidently intended Federal statutes, such as the safety appliance acts (27 Stat. at L. 531, chap. 196, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3174; 32 Stat. at L. 943, chap. 976, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1314; 36 Stat. at L. 298, chap. 160, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1327; id. 1913, chap. 103, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1333), and the hours of service act (34 Stat. at L. 1415, chap. 2939, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1321). For it is not to be conceived that, in enacting a general law for establishing and enforcing the responsibility of common carriers by railroad to their employees in interstate commerce, Congress intended to permit the legislatures of the several states to determine the effect of contributory negligence and assumption of risk, by enacting statutes for the safety of employees, since this would in effect relegate to state control two of the essential factors that determine the responsibility of the employer.\n It seems to us that  4, in eliminating the defense of assumption of risk in the cases indicated, quite plainly evidences the legislative intent that in all other cases such assumption shall have its former effect as a complete bar to the action. And, taking  3 and 4 together, there is no doubt that Congress recognized the distinction between contributory negligence and assumption of risk; for, while it is declared that neither of these shall avail the carrier in cases where the violation of a statute has contributed to the injury or death of the employee, there is, with respect to cases not in this category, a limitation upon the effect that is to be given to contributory negligence, while no corresponding limitation is imposed upon the defense of assumption of risk- perhaps none was deemed feasible.\n The distinction, although simple, is sometimes overlooked. Contributory negligence involves the notion of some fault or breach of duty on the part of the employee; and since it is ordinarily his duty to take some precaution \n\n[233 U.S. 492, 504]\n\u00a0\n for his own safety when engaged in a hazardous occupation, contributory negligence is sometimes defined as a failure to use such care for his safety as ordinarily prudent employees in similar circumstances would use. On the other hand, the assumption of risk, even though the risk be obvious, may be free from any suggestion of fault or negligence on the part of the employee. The risks may be present, notwithstanding the exercise of all reasonable care on his part. Some employments are necessarily fraught with danger to the workman,-danger that must be and is confronted in the line of his duty. Such dangers as are normally and necessarily incident to the occupation are presumably taken into the account in fixing the rate of wages. And a workman of mature years is taken to assume risks of this sort, whether he is actually aware of them or not. But risks of another sort, not naturally incident to the occupation, may arise out of the failure of the employer to exercise due care with respect to providing a safe place of work and suitable and safe appliances for the work. These employee is not treated as assuming until he becomes aware of the defect or disrepair and of the risk arising from it, unless defect and risk alike are so obvious that an ordinarily prudent person under the circumstances would have observed and apperciated them. These distinctions have been recognized and applied in numerous decisions of this court. Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. McDade, \n191 \nU.S. 64, 68\n, 48 S. L. ed. 96, 100, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 24, 15 Am.

Rep. 229; and cases cited.\n When the employee does know of the defect, and appreciates the risk that is attributable to it, then if he continues in the employment without objection, or without obtaining from the employer or his representative an assurance that the defect will be remedied, the employee \n\n[233 U.S. 492, 505]\n\u00a0\n assumes the risk, even though it arise out of the master's breach of duty. If, however, there be a promise of reparation, then during such time as may be reasonably required for its performance, or until the particular time specified for its performance, the employee, relying upon the promise, does not assume the risk unless at least the danger be so imminent that no ordinarily prudent man under the circumstances would rely upon such promise.

This branch of the law of master and servant seems to be traceable to Holmes v. Clarke, 6 Hurlst. & N. 349, 30 L. J. Exch. N. S. 135, 7 Jur. N. S. 397, 3 L. T. N. S. 675, 9 Week. Rep. 419; Clarke v. Holmes, 7 Hurlst. & N. 937, 9 L. T. N. S. 178, 10 Week. Rep. 405.\n In the light of these principles, the rulings of the trial court in the case at bar must be considered.\n Defendant specifically requested an instruction that plaintiff's right to recover damages was to be determined by the provisions of the Federal act, and that 'if you find by a preponderance of evidence that the water glass on the engine on which plaintiff was employed was not provided with a guard glass, and the condition of the glass was open and obvious and was fully known to plaintiff, and he continued to use such water glass with such knowledge and without objection, and that he knew the risk incident thereto, then the court charges you that the plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk incident to such use, and you will answer the second issue 'Yea.\" The court gave this instruction as applicable to the issue of contributory negligence, and instead of the words, 'then the court charges you that the plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk incident to such use, and you will answer the second issue 'Yes.\" used the words, 'then the court charges you that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, and you will answer the third issue 'Yes.\" To the refusal to give the instruction as requested, and the modification of it, defendant excepted. \n\n[233 U.S. 492, 506]\n\u00a0\n The trial court evidently deemed, as did the state supreme court, that the topic of assumption of risk, with reference to the circumstances of the case, was sufficiently and properly covered by an instruction actually given as follows: after stating in general terms that 'a man assumes the risk when he takes employment, incident to the class of work which he is to perform,' but that 'he does not assume the risk incident to the negligence of his employer in providing machinery and appliances with which he has to work,' the court proceeded as follows:\n'On the other hand, the employer has the right to assume that his employee will go about his work in a reasonably safe way, and give due regard to the machinery and appliances which are in his hands and under his control, and if you should find from the evidence by its greater weight (because the burden in this instance is on the defendant), that the plaintiff knew of the absence of the guard or shield to the water guage and failed to give notice to the defendant or to the agent whose duty it was to furnish the water gauge and appliance, and he continued to use it without giving that notice, it being furnished to him in a safe condition, then he assumed the risk incident to his work in the engine with the glass water gauge in that condition, although he might have handled his engine in every other respect with perfect care.' [Italics ours.]\n\n It will be observed that by this instruction the application of the rule of assumption of risk was conditioned upon the jury finding that the water gauge, when furnished to plaintiff, was in a safe condition. Here again the court appears to have followed the local statute, rather than the act of Congress; for  2646, N. C. Revisal of 1905, already quoted, has been held by the state supreme court to abolish assumption of risk as a bar to an action by a railroad employee for an injury attributable to defective appliances furnished by the employer. Coley v. North Carolina R. \n\n[233 U.S. 492, 507]\n\u00a0\n Co. 128 N. C. 534, 57 L.R.A. 817, 39 S. E. 43. The trial court, while recognizing that the act of Congress applied so far as its terms extended, and that by its terms the employee is not to be held to have assumed the risk in any case where the violation by the carrier of a statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury, at the same time held that, since no statute had been enacted covering such an appliance as the glass water gauge, the rights of plaintiff were such as he would have under the state law. An instruction to the jury to this effect preceded the instructions we have just quoted.\n It is true that such an appliance as the water gauge and guard glass in question is not covered by the provisions of the safety appliance act, or any other law passed by Congress for the safety of employees, in force at the time this action arose. But the necessary result of this is not to leave the employer responsible for the consequences of any defect in such an appliance, excluding the common-law rule as to assumption of risk, but to leave the matter in this respect open to the ordinary application of the common-law rule. The adoption of the opposite view would in effect leave the several state laws, and not the act of Congress, to control the subjectmatter.\n By the instruction as given, the application of the rule of assumed risk was confined to the single hypothesis that the jury should find the guard glass was in position when the engine was delivered to plaintiff on the morning of July 27th. This, as already pointed out, was one of the questions in dispute; plaintiff having testified that the guard glass was missing at that time, while his fireman testified (and in this was corroborated by circumstantial evidence) that it was in place at that time, and was subsequently broken. But by the common law, with respect to the assumption by the employee of the risk of injuries attributable to defects due to the employer's negligence, when known and appreciated by the employee, \n\n[233 U.S. 492, 508]\n\u00a0\n and not made the subject of objection or complaint by him, it is quite immaterial whether the defect existed when the appliance was first placed in his charge, or subsequently arose. Hence, if the guard glass was missing when plaintiff first took the engine, as he testified, and he, knowing of its absence and the consequent risk to himself, continued to use the water guage without giving notice of the defect to the defendant or its representative, he assumed the risk.\n Defendant was entitled to have the requested instruction given respecting assumption of risk, and as the charge actually given did not cover the same ground, there was error.\n Its harmful effect is conspicuously evident when we note that the jury, while finding that plaintiff did not assume the risk, at the same time found that he did by his own negligence contribute to his injury. Presumably, if instructed in the manner requested by defendant, the jury would have found that the risk was assumed, and this would have entitled defendant to a judgment in its favor, instead of a mere mitigation of the damages, which was the consequence of a finding of contributory negligence.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","197":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSEIM v.

Are purchasers and users of infringing tires made by the Kokomo Company immune from prosecution by the owners of the patent?\n\n'3d. Are the defendants immune from prosecution by the complainant Hurd for using and selling the infringing tires made by the Kokomo Company, and sold and delivered to them by the Diamond Rubber Company of New York, at the city of New York, in the exclusive territory conveyed to Hurd prior to the commencement of the action against the Kokomo Company?\n\n'4th. If the Kokomo Company is immune in making the infringing rubber, which is only one element of the combination of the patent, are its customers who purchase the rubber of the Kokomo Company and the metal rims and retaining wires of other parties, and sell them to be assembled upon wheel rims, making the completed structure of the patent, also immune from prosecution?'\n\n Mr. Charles K. Offield for Seim et al.\n Mr. Walter E. Ward for Hurd et al.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Hughes:\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes, after making the above statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Hurd, a licensee for a limited territory under the Grant patent for rubber tires, joining with him the legal owner of the patent and the holder of an exclusive license subject to the rights of Hurd and another, brought suit against Seim and Reissig, for infringement. It is stated that the defendants purchased the infringing tires from the Diamond Rubber Company of New York, and, also, that it is the contention of the defendants that these tires were bought by the Diamond Rubber Company from the \n\n[232 U.S. 420, 426]\n\u00a0\n Kokomo Company. The patent had been sustained in a suit against the Diamond Rubber Company (89 C. C. A. 582, 162 Fed. 895, \n220 U.S. 428\n, 55 L. ed. 527, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 444), but by a provision in the final decree there was excepted from the operation of the injunction tires manufactured by parties to other suits in which the patent had been declared invalid, naming, among others, the Kokomo Company.\n The further statement of the certificate, however, makes it plain that the defendants did not purchase the patented structure, but made it themselves. The statement is that 'such tires' (referring to those purchased by the defendants) 'were delivered to defendants at the city of New York, and then taken to Albany, complainant Hurd's territory, and the rubber, metal channel, and retaining wires were there assembled and attached to the wheel rim by defendants, and not by the Kokomo Company or the Diamond Rubber Company of New York.'\n The elements in the Grant structure were old. There had been previous combinations of rubber, metal channels, and retaining wires in the effort to produce a successful rubber tire (220 U. S. pp. 438, 439). The claims of the Grant patent were narrow and were limited closely to a specified combination which, through the co-operation of the various parts, when these were correlated in the precise adjustment described, produced a new and useful result.\n It is thus apparent that the defendants themselves constructed the device, effecting that union of the separate elements which alone could bring the structure within the patent claims. In this aspect, it is immaterial from whom they bought the rubber or the wires or the channel. It is not the case of the purchase of the article in question from one who had a right to sell. There was no actual infringement until they made the trie, and for their act in making it they could not escape liability by the purchase of parts from others. See Rubber Tire Wheel Co. \n\n[232 U.S. 420, 427]\n\u00a0\n v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. decided this day [\n232 U.S. 413\n, 58 L. ed . --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 403].\n None of the questions certified is apposite to the facts as we understand the certificate to state them. It may have been the intention by the use of the words 'infringing tires' in the first, second, and third questions to refer to the rubber stock only. It seems to be conceded in the arguments of both parties that the rubber alone is made by the Kokomo Company. But the questions, as put, are not raised by the case made, and for that reason they must go unanswered. Neither the right of the Kokomo Company to make the Grant structure, nor the right of a purchaser or user of that structure, if made and sold by the Kokomo Company, is involved.\n The fourth question is as follows:\n'If the Kokomo Company is immune in making the infringing rubber, which is only one element of the combination of the patent, are its customers, who purchase the rubber of the Kokomo Company and the metal rims and retaining wires of other parties, and sell them, to be assembled upon wheel rims, making the completed structure of the patent, also immune from prosecution?'\n\n A similar question is answered in the case of Woodward Co. v. Hurd, decided this day [\n232 U.S. 428\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 409], but it is not presented by the facts of the present case. There is no suggestion that the defendants here purchased the various parts and sold them to be assembled by their customers, but, on the contrary, as we have said, the defendants made the structure themselves.\n In view of the form of the questions, the certificate must be dismissed.\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","198":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSELIG v. HAMILTON(1914)\nNo. 361\nArgued: May 6, 1913Decided: June 22, 1914\n\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 652, 654]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Abram I. Elkus and Wesley S. Sawyer for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[234 U.S. 652, 655]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James E. Trask, E. H. Morphy, and John J. Clark for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This action was brought in the district court of the United States for the southern district of New York, to enforce the liability of a stockholder of an insolvent Minnesota corporation. \n\n[234 U.S. 652, 656]\n\u00a0\n In 1902 the Evans, Munzer, Pickering Company was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota for the purpose of transacting a mercantile business. In 1904 its name was changed to the Evans, johnson, Sloane Company. Its capital stock consisted of 1,500 shares of common and 1,000 shares of preferred stock of the par value of $100 each. The plaintiff in error, Arthur L. Selig, became the owner of 50 shares of preferred stock in 1902, and held the same until September 5, 1904, when they were transferred on the books of the company to Max Mayer. On September 25, 1905, a petition in bankruptcy was filed against the company in the United States district court for the district of Minnesota; adjudication followed on October 13, 1905, and trustees in bankruptcy were appointed.\n On May 28, 1906, a creditor of the company, on behalf of itself and all other creditors, brought a sequestration suit in the district court of Ramsey county, Minnesota, for the purpose of enforcing the liability of the stockholders of the company. In that suit, on June 25, 1906, Charles E. Hamilton (the defendant in error here) was appointed receiver. Further order was made on June 28, 1906, requiring creditors to exhibit their claims, and become parties to the suit, within six months from the date of the first publication of the order. On July 6, 1906, in the same suit, the receiver filed a petition for an assessment upon the stockholders. The court set a date for hearing and directed notice to be given by publication and mailing. Thereupon, on September 4, 1906, the court entered its order assessing the sum of $100 against each share of the capital stock and against those liable as stockholders on account of such shares; the latter were directed to pay to the receiver the amount of the assessment within thirty days, and the receiver was authorized in default of payment to institute an action against anyone liable as a stockholder, in any court having jurisdiction, whether in the state of Minnesota or elsewhere. On April 23, 1907, \n\n[234 U.S. 652, 657]\n\u00a0\n the court entered a decree-in the sequestration suit-allowing the claims against the company as set forth in an annexed schedule, which showed the nature of each claim, its amount, and when it arose. A further decree allowing an additional claim was entered on February 13, 1908. It appeared from these decrees, and the schedules to which they referred, that of the claims thus allowed, upwards of $11,000 wholly arose prior to September, 1904, and, in addition, over $20,000 in part arose prior to that date.\n Pursuant to the order of September 4, 1906, the present action was brought in December, 1909, to recover from Selig the amount assessed on 50 shares. The complaint set forth the proceedings in the sequestration suit, the statutes under which they were instituted, and the order of assessment. It was also alleged that Selig, on or about September 5, 1904, had transferred his stock, when the company was in an unsound financial condition, for the purpose of concealing his ownership, but that he remained the owner of the entire beneficial interest in the shares in question, and that the transfer was fraudulent as against the creditors; and also that, under the law of Minnesota, a stockholder in a corporation could not avoid his liability for prior debts by a bona fide sale of his shares to a solvent person and a recorded transfer. In his answer, Selig admitted the transfer of the shares at the time mentioned, alleged that it was duly made and entered on the corporate books, and denied the other allegations pertinent to his liability.\n Upon the trial the record of the proceedings in the sequestration suit, including the order of assessment and the decrees allowing the claims of creditors, were received in evidence. The entry in the stock book showing the record of the issuance of 50 shares to Selig and their transfer, together with the original certificate as canceled, was introduced. Aside from what was contended to be the effect of the proceedings in the sequestration suit, there \n\n[234 U.S. 652, 658]\n\u00a0\n was no evidence impeaching the transfer. This being the state of the proof, the plaintiff rested and the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint upon the grounds that the plaintiff had failed to prove facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, that the suit should have been brought in equity, and not at law, and that the cause of action had accrued more than three years prior to the commencement of the action, and hence was barred by the statute of limitations of the state of New York. Each party also moved for a direction of a verdict. The district judge directed a verdict in favor of the receiver for the sum of $5,000 with interest, and in the view that, in sustaining and enforcing the order of assessment, a question arose involving the application of the Federal Constitution, this writ of error has been sued out.\n The legislation of Minnesota with respect to the liability of stockholders, as construed by the state court, was reviewed and its constitutional validity was upheld in Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 U.S. 516\n, 51 L. ed. 1163, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 755. The conclusions there reached were reaffirmed in Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 U.S. 243\n, 56 L. ed. 749, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 415. Briefly restating them, it may be said: The Constitution of Minnesota (art. 10,  3) provides: 'Each stockholder in any corporation (excepting those organized for the purpose of carrying on any kind of manufacturing or mechanical business) shall be liable to the amount of stock held or owned by him.' The provision is self-executing. The liability of the stockholder, measured by the par value of his stock, 'is not to the corporation, but to the creditors collectively; is not penal, but contractual; is not joint, but several; and the mode and means of its enforcement are subject to legislative regulation.' (See Willis v. Mabon (Willis v. St. Paul Sanitation Co.) 48 Minn. 140, 16 L.R.A. 281, 31 Am. St. Rep. 626, 50 N. W. 1110; McKusick v. Seymour S. & Co. 48 Minn. 158, 50 N. W. 1114; Minneapolis Baseball Co. v. City Bank, 66 Minn. 441, 38 L.R. A. 415, 69 N. W. 331; Hanson v. Davison, 73 Minn. 454, 76 N. W. 254; Straw & E. Mfg. Co. v. L. D. Kilbourne Boot & Shoe Co. 80 Minn. 125, 83 N. W. 36; London & N. W. American Mortg. Co. v. St. Paul Park Improv. Co. \n\n[234 U.S. 652, 659]\n\u00a0\n 84 Minn. 144, 86 N. W. 872; Way v. Barney, 116 Minn. 285, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 648, 133 N. W. 801, Ann. Cas. 1913A, 719). Under the statute of 1894 (chap. 76), this liability was enforceable exclusively by means of a single suit in equity, in a court of the state, which was brought for the benefit of all the creditors against all the stockholders, or as many as could be served with process within the state. Hale v. Allinson, \n188 U.S. 56\n, 47 L. ed. 380, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 244; Finney v. Guy, \n189 U.S. 335\n, 47 L. ed. 839, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 558. To make the remedy more effective, the act of 1899 ( chap. 272) was passed, and under the provisions of this statute as continued in substance (Way v. Barney, 116 Minn. 294, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 648, 133 N. W. 801, Ann. Cas. 1913A, 719), in the Revised Laws of 1905,  3184- 3190, the proceedings here in question were had. Provision was made-upon hearing at the time appointed, and after notice by publication or otherwise, as directed by the court-for receiving evidence as to the probable indebtedness of the corporation, the expenses of the receivership, the amount of available assets, the parties liable as stockholders, and the nature and extent of such liability; and, thereupon, the court was authorized to levy a ratable assessment 'upon all parties liable as stockholders, or upon or on account of any stock or shares of such corporation, for such amount,' proportion, or percentage of the liability as the court in its discretion might 'deem proper, taking into account the probable solvency or insolvency of stockholders and the probable expenses of collecting the assessment.' The order and the assessment thereby levied was made 'conclusive upon and against all parties liable upon or on account of any stock or shares of said corporation, whether appearing or represented at said hearing or having notice thereof or not, as to all matters relating to the amount of and the propriety of and necessity for the said assessment.' [\n206 U.S. 526\n.] After the expiration of the time fixed for payment of the amount assessed, the receiver was authorized to bring actions against every person failing to pay, wherever he might be found, whether in minnesota or elsewhere. See chap. 272, Laws of 1899, \n\n[234 U.S. 652, 660]\n\u00a0\n  3-6; Rev. Laws 1905,  3184-3187. The constitutional validity of these provisions was sustained upon the ground that the statute is a reasonable regulation for enforcing the liability assumed by those who become stockholders in corporations organized under the laws of Minnesota; that while the order levying the assessment is made conclusive as to all matters relating to the amount and propriety thereof, and the necessity therefor, one against whom it is sought to be enforced is not precluded from showing that he is not a stockholder, or is not the holder of as many shares as is alleged, or has a claim against the corporation which in law or in equity he is entitled to set off against the assessment, or has any other defense personal to himself; and that while the order is conclusive against the stockholder as to the matters stated, although he may not have been a party to the suit in which it was made, or notified that an assessment was contemplated, this is not a tenable objection, as the order is not in the nature of a personal judgment against him, and he must be deemed, by virtue of his relation to the corporation and the obligation assumed with respect to its debts, to be represented by it in the proceeding. Straw & E. Mfg. Co. v. L. D. Kilbourne Boot & Shoe Co. 80 Minn. 133, 136, 83 N. W. 36; Bernheimer v. Converse, supra, pp. 528, 532; Converse v. Hamilton, supra, p. 256.\n Further, it must be assumed that a stockholder cannot, even by a bona fide transfer of his stock, escape liability for the debts of the corporation theretofore incurred. The Minnesota statute provides that a transfer of shares 'shall not in any way exempt the person making such transfer from any liabilities of said corporation which were created prior to such transfer.' Gen. Stat, 1894,  2599; Rev. Laws 1905,  2864. And in Gunnison v. United States Invest. Co. 70 Minn. 292, 73 N. W. 149, the court said that 'by virtue of the statute a stockholder cannot relieve himself from the liability for the prior \n\n[234 U.S. 652, 661]\n\u00a0\n debts of the corporation by a bona fide sale and transfer of his stock on the books of the corporation, whatever the rule may be in the absence of the statute.\n In the light of the principles established by these decisions, it must be concluded:\n\n\n (1)\n The bankruptcy proceedings against the corporation did not stand in the way of a resort to the statutory method of enforcing the stockholder's liability. It was not corporate assets (Minneapolis Baseball Co. v. City Bank, 66 Minn. 446, 38 L.R.A. 415, 69 N. W. 331; Way v. Barney, supra); and Congress had not undertaken to provide that the discharge in bankruptcy of a corporation should release the stockholders. No question as to this is raised by the plaintiff in error.\n\n\n (2)\n The defendant, Selig, in this action brought by the receiver against him in the district court in New York to recover the amount assessed, was not concluded with respect to his personal liability. He was free to deny that he was, or had been, a stockholder in the company; to dispute the allegation as to the length of time that he remained a stockholder; in short, to litigate any matter which bore upon the extent or duration of his stockholding, or any other personal defense. Straw & E. Mfg. Co. v. L. D. Kilbourne Boot & Shoe Co. supra. The order of the Minnesota court in the proceedings for the purpose of the assessment, in which he was represented by the corporation, and of which he was notified only by publication and mailing of notice, did not conclude him with respect to the issue, so far as it concerned the transfer of his stock, or the good faith with which the transfer was made. Inasmuch as the transfer was proved to have been made in September, 1904, and no evidence was introduced to discredit the transaction, it must be assumed, for the present purpose, that the defendant's stock ownership then ceased, and that he was not liable for the payment of debts subsequently contracted by the corporation. \n\n[234 U.S. 652, 662]\n\u00a0\n (3) But despite the transfer, Selig remained liable for the corporate debts previously incurred. Moreover, it cannot be doubted that the authority of the Minnesota court under the statute was not confined to proceedings to assess existing stockholders. The act of 1899, by its express terms, applied in cases of liability arising upon shares 'at any time held or owned by such stockholders,' and provided for the making of an assessment against 'all parties liable as stockholders.' Laws 1899, chap. 272,  1, 3; Rev. Laws 1905,  3185. This obviously included former stockholders in relation to debts antedating their transfers; and the constitutional validity of the act in this aspect is as clear as is its validity with respect to the authorization of an assessment against existing stockholders. So far as the jurisdiction of the court to levy the assessment is concerned, no distinction can be maintained. The basis of jurisdiction is the same in each case; it is found in the contractual obligation assumed in becoming a member of a minnesota corporation, and in the consequent submission to the reasonable regulations of the state for the purpose of making the liability effectual. Bernheimer v. Converse, supra.\n It follows that if the court, thus having jurisdiction, and acting upon the evidence before it in the statutory proceeding, assessed former stockholders for the purpose of providing for debts incurred while they held their stock, its determination with respect to the amount of the assessment and the necessity therefor must be deemed conclusive. These questions cannot be reopened in another court when the receiver sues to collect the amount of the assessment. The stockholder in such a suit is free to urge his personal defenses, but this does not mean that he may resist the receiver's demand upon the ground that the assessment was not needed. The marshaling of the amounts recovered from stockholders is also the appropriate subject for the consideration of the court which, \n\n[234 U.S. 652, 663]\n\u00a0\n under the statute, collects and distributes the fund. It is quite obvious that another court, in an action by the receiver against the stockholder, could not undertake to fix the amount required to pay the debts for which the stockholder is liable unless it virtually assumed the duty imposed by the statute of determining what a ratable assessment should be, and thus denied due credit to the determination already made in a court of competent jurisdicition.\n It is insisted, however, that no assessment was made against the defendant as a past stockholder; that the order of assessment as made by the Minnesota court was applicable to present stockholders only. It is true that in the receiver's petition for the levy of an assessment, the persons alleged to be liable were set forth as existing stockholders. Of these, it was averred that some (including the plaintiff in error) had transferred their stock for the purpose of avoiding liability, and that others had placed their shares in the names of agents; but as to all, it was asserted that they were, and continued to be, the owners of the entire beneficial interest. But the petition prayed that the probable amount of the indebtedness and of the costs and expenses of the proceedings, and the probable amount which could be collected 'from said stockholders, and all persons or parties liable as such, on said stock,' should be ascertained, and that the court should levy a ratable assessment upon each share and against each of the stockholders 'liable on said stock.' Taking the petition, in the light of the statute, we think that, despite the allegations with respect to the fraudulent character of the transfers mentioned and the continued ownership by the transferrers of the shares described, the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court was invoked for the making of such an assessment as the court in its discretion might consider necessary in order to enforce the stockholders' liability, as it actually existed, with respect to the corporate debts remaining unpaid. \n\n[234 U.S. 652, 664]\n\u00a0\n What the court did determine must be ascertained from the order of assessment. This order, after reciting that the matter came on to be heard at the time appointed, pursuant to the petition, and that the court had 'received and duly considered all the evidence presented,' provided for an assessment of an amount equal to the par value 'on each and every share of the capital stock,' and 'against the persons or parties liable as stockholders . . . for, upon, or on account of such shares of stock.' It further provided that 'each and every person or party liable as such stockholder' should pay to the receiver the amount assessed, and the receiver was authorized to collect 'the several amounts due from the several persons or parties liable as stockholders,' and to bring suit in case of the failure of 'any person . . . liable as a stockholder' to pay as required. These provisions are certainly broad enough to include all stockholders who were actually liable, and we should not be justified in treating the order as expressing less than its terms stated.\n In Tiffany v. Giesen, 96 Minn. 488, 105 N. W. 901, the plaintiff, as receiver, by virtue of an order of assessment under the statute, sought to recover against a stockholder in an insolvent corporation who had transferred his shares. It appearing that the defendant was the owner of the stock during the existence of the indebtedness of the company, it was held that the plaintiff had made out a cause of action. The objection that, as the transferee was the person primarily liable, the action could not be maintained against the transferrer, was overruled.\n It is urged that the plaintiff in error was bound to contribute only ratably with all other stockholders who were liable with respect to the debts which arose prior to September 5, 1904, the date of the transfer, and that no assessment had been made based upon those debts. But this objection, as we view it, does not go to the existence \n\n[234 U.S. 652, 665]\n\u00a0\n of the jurisdiction to make the order of assessment, or to the scope of the order as it was actually made, but rather to the question whether the court committed error in the exercise of the authority which it unquestionably possessed. If it did, the remedy lay in an application to the Minnesota court for the correction deemed to be necessary, and not in a collateral attack. The order in question does not provide for the distribution of the amount to be paid by the plaintiff in error, but that all moneys collected from the stockholders by the receiver should be held until the further order of the court. It is not to be assumed that these moneys will be applied to any indebtedness as to which the stockholders contributing respectively are not liable. We cannot doubt that the plaintiff in error, if he so desires, will have suitable opportunity to be heard as to the application of the amount which he may pay to the receiver, that it will be used only in the discharge of his obligation, and that any surplus to which he may be entitled will be duly returned. Laws 1899, chap. 272,  11. See Rev. Laws 1905,  3190. The statute further provides that any stockholder who has paid his assessment shall be entitled to force contribution from any stockholder who has not paid, and for that purpose shall be subrogated to the rights of the creditors or the receiver of the corporation against every such delinquent stockholder in such manner and to such extent as may be just and equitable. Ibid.\n We cannot regard it as essential to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Minnesota court that it should be required, in order not to forego recovery from stockholders who had transferred their stock, to make a separate and distinct assessment against all the then stockholders at the date of every transfer appearing upon the books. The plan of the statute was intended to afford a practicable remedy, and the order to be made thereunder was, in the nature of things, a provisional one, representing the best \n\n[234 U.S. 652, 666]\n\u00a0\n judgment of the court upon the evidence before it as to the amount of the assessment required. That assessment was leviable upon every share and against all persons liable as stockholders. If the plaintiff in error was among this number, he was not entitled to resist the recovery by reason of the nature or amount of the assessment, which was levied in conformity with the statute, but he was properly remitted to the Minnesota court for the adjustment of such equities as he might have.\n It is said, however, that on the trial of the present action, there was no evidence that there were debts remaining unpaid, which antedated his transfer of stock. But the decrees, entered in the parent suit in Minnesota, which determined the amount of the outstanding claims and when they arose, were introduced in evidence. These decrees showed that there were debts, in excess of the amount demanded of the plaintiff in error, which arose before his shares were transferred. In the proceedings appropriate to the liquidation, which related to the allowance of these claims, the plaintiff in error, by virtue of his connection with the corporation and the obligation he had assumed, was sufficiently represented by the presence of the corporation itself (Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 U.S. 532\n, 51 L. ed. 1175, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 755); and we see no reason to question the admissibility of the evidence. There was no attempt to controvert it.\n The remaining question relates to the statute of limitations. It is contended that the action is barred by  394 of the New York Code of Civil Procedure. In Bernheimer v. Converse, supra (p. 535), the court expressed the opinion that this section did not apply where the corporation was not a 'moneyed corporation or banking association,' and that the period of limitation under the New York Code was six years ( 382). (See Platt v. Wilmot, \n193 U.S. 602\n, 48 L. ed. 809, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 542, where, in the opinion of the court, delivered by \n\n[234 U.S. 652, 667]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice Peckham, the history of  394 is reviewed.) We adhere to this view, and the action must be regarded as brought in time.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","199":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHAPIRO v. U S(1914)\nNo. 93\nArgued: Decided: December 14, 1914\n\n\n\n Mr. Elijah N. Zoline for plaintiff in error.\n Assistant Attorney General Wallace and Solicitor General Davis for defendant in error. \n\n[235 U.S. 412, 413]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n On June 21, 1910, David Shapiro-the plaintiff in error-was indicted for violation of the internal revenue laws. The indictment contained thirteen counts. Eleven charged offenses punishable by both fine and imprisonment; one (the tenth) was for an offense punishable by fine only; and one (the thirteenth) was for an offense punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both. \n1\n On June 24, 1910, the plaintiff in error pleaded 'not guilty' to every count; on January 3, 1911, 'by leave of court first had and obtained,' he withdrew this plea, and, being then arraigned upon the indictment, he pleaded 'nolo contendere thereto;' on January 20, 1911, the United States entered a nolle prosequi as to all the counts, save those numbered 4, 9, and 12, each of which charged a felony (Crim. Code,  335 [35 Stat. at L. 1152, chap. 321, Comp. Stat. 1913,  10509]); later, on the same day, the cause 'coming on to be heard on defendant's plea of nolo contendere,' the court 'having heard the evidence by the parties adduced and statements of counsel' took the cause under advisement; and on January 23, 1911, the court, being fully advised, found the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment, and upon this finding sentenced him to imprisonment for two years and to pay a fine in the sum of $10,000 in addition to costs.\n Shapiro sued out a writ of error from the circuit court of appeals, assigning as errors (1) that the district court had no jurisdiction to pass judgment in this case on a plea of nolo contendere; (2) that it erred in sentencing him without a trial by jury; (3) that by the judgment he had been deprived of his liberty without due process of law, within \n\n[235 U.S. 412, 414]\n\u00a0\n the meaning of the 5th Amendment; and (4) that the sentence was excessive and should be limited to a fine only. The circuit court of appeals reversed the judgment. 116 C. C. A. 70, 196 Fed. 268. The grounds of the reversal are set forth in its opinion in Tucker v. United States, 41 L.R.A.( N.S.) 70, 116 C. C. A. 62, 196 Fed. 260,-a case decided at the same time, which the court deemed to be similar in all material respects. It was held that the plea of nolo contendere was not authorized in the case of an offense which must be punished by imprisonment, with or without a fine; that where counts charging offenses which must be punished by imprisonment are joined with counts charging those which may be punished by fine only, the plea may be entertained as 'in the nature of a compromise;' and that in such case it is 'within the authority of the prosecuting officer to elect to stand, for the purposes of the plea, on the counts applicable thereto,' and it is 'within the jurisdiction of the court to approve such submission.' It was further held that in the particular case the proceedings and judgment were in derogation of the plea; that it did not appear in the record that the plea was either 'accepted in fact' or 'substantially so treated;' that the proceedings leading to the judgment, the adjudication of guilt, and the judgment itself in its sentence of imprisonment, were inconsistent with the acceptance of the plea; and hence that the record failed to show an authorized plea to support the judgment. 196 Fed. pp. 267, 268. The cause was remanded 'with direction either to accept or refuse acceptance of the nolo contendere plea as tendered, and proceed further in conformity with law.'\n Thereupon, the district court, against the exception of the plaintiff in error, refused to accept the plea of nolo contendere tendered by him, and directed him to plead to the indictment; he stood mute, and the court entered for him a plea of not guilty. Subsequently, by leave of the court, the plaintiff in error filed three special pleas. The first \n\n[235 U.S. 412, 415]\n\u00a0\n plea, in substance, set forth the prior proceedings, and alleged that the plea of nolo contendere had been duly accepted, that the court, acting thereon, had heard evidence solely for the purpose of fixing the punishment to be imposed, and that therefore he had been once before in jeopardy for the same offense, and ought not, by virtue of the protection guaranteed by the 5th Amendment, to be further prosecuted. The second special plea set forth that the defendant had compromised the civil and criminal liability with the commissioner of internal revenue. And the third special plea urged that, while the writ of error was pending in the circuit court of appeals, the original order of supersedeas had been modified so as to permit the judgment to be enforced as to the fine, that thereupon the United States had procured to be seized a certain draft for $ 5,000 in partial satisfaction of the fine, and that it followed, under the 5th Amendment, that, the judgment having been satisfied in part, the plaintiff in error could not be tried again upon the same indictment.\n Meanwhile, the plaintiff in error moved in the district court to correct the record so as to have it show that the plea or nolo contendere had been accepted, and petitioned the circuit court of appeals to release its mandate in order that the correction might be made. This petition was denied and the motion in the district court was not pressed.\n The government demurred to each of the three special pleas, and the district court, sustaining the demurrers, proceeded to trial. The jury rendered a verdict of guilty, motions for a new trial and in arrest were overruled, and the plaintiff in error was sentenced to imprisonment for two years and to pay a fine of $5,000. The case is now brought directly to this court.\n The motion to dismiss must be granted. Aspen Min. & Smelting Co. v. Billings, \n150 U.S. 31\n, 37 L. ed. 986, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 4; Brown v.

It may not have been observed by the appellate court that, in the case of Shapiro, the government had entered a nolle prosequi as to the counts charging an offense which might be punished by fine alone; but this being the actual state of the record, it cannot be doubted that, reading the mandate of the appellate court in the light of its opinion, the district court was not free to accept the plea of nolo contendere as applicable to the remaining 'prison counts.' Its obedience to the mandate under the law as declared by the circuit court of appeals required it, with respect to these counts upon which the government stood, to reject the plea of nolo contendere and to proceed with the case. It is now assigned as error that the district court did set aside this plea. It is insisted that the plea had been accepted when originally tendered, but this is negatived by the ruling of the circuit court of appeals, and we are in substance asked to revise its decision upon a writ of error to the district court. This would be to transcend the limits of our jurisdiction as it has been clearly defined in the cases cited.\n It is no answer to say that new constitutional questions were raised by the special pleas after the case had been remanded to the district court. We cannot take the case in fragments, and if it is reviewable upon a direct writ of error, by reason of the presence of a constitutional question, the whole case must come here, and we must assume the duty of passing upon the proceedings of the district court which were taken by it under the mandate of the circuit court of appeals. The ruling upon this point in Union Trust Co. v. Westhus, supra, is controlling. There, the constitutional question was raised by an amendment to the pleadings in the district court after the decision of \n\n[235 U.S. 412, 417]\n\u00a0\n the circuit court of appeals, and it was insisted that this fact made the previous decisions inapplicable. But the asserted distinction was not sustained. The error lay, it was said, 'in pursuing a mistaken avenue of approach to this court;' that is, 'of coming directly from a trial court in a case where, by reason of the cause having been previously decided by the circuit court of appeals, the way to that court should have been pursued even if it was proposed to ultimately bring the case here.' There is, as was pointed out in the Alton Case, ample opportunity for a review by this court of every judgment or decree of a lower court which the act of 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517] (now embodied in the Judicial Code [ 36 Stat. at L. 1191, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1108]) contemplated should be here reviewed; but, in the distribution of jurisdiction, this court is not authorized 'to review a judgment or decree of a circuit court of appeals otherwise than by proceedings addressed directly to that court.'\n Dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Counts 1, 2, 3, and 4 charged a violation of  3296 of the Revised Statutes (Comp.

BRICKELL(1914)\nNo. 458\nArgued: January 12, 1914Decided: April 6, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 304, 305]\n\u00a0\n Appellant, which is a New Jersey corporation carrying on a mercantile business in many places in the state of Alabama in the sale and renting of sewing machines, in part from regularly established places of business and in part by means of delivery wagons going from place to place in the respective counties in which its stores are located, filed its bill of complaint against appellees, who are the agents of the state, charged with the administration of the tax laws, and therein sought to restrain by \n\n[233 U.S. 304, 306]\n\u00a0\n injunction the enforcement against it of the state tax prescribed by  32 of an act for providing revenues, approved March 31, 1911 (Session Acts, p. 180), which reads as follows:\n'Sec. 32. Sewing machines.-Each person firm, or corporation selling or delivering sewing machines either in person or through agents, shall pay $50 annually, for each county in which they may sell or deliver said articles. And for each wagon and team used in delivering or displaying the same an additional sum in each county of $25 annually; but this section shall not apply to merchants selling the above enumerated articles at their regularly established places of business.'\n\n And also to enjoin the enforcement of county taxes, amounting to 50 per centum of the state tax prescribed by the above section, which might be imposed in the several counties for county purposes under  33F of the same act.\n The bill, as amended, besides showing diverse citizenship of the parties, avers that complainant is qualified under the state laws to do business within the state as a foreign corporation, and has established, in thirty counties of the state, thirty-six regular places of business or stores, which are conducted by it; that complainant buys sewing machines and parts to supply breakage and defects therein and a variety of sewing machine accessories without the state, causes them to be shipped to its places of business within the state, and keeps them at these places for sale to the general public.\n In each of the counties, except the county of Russell, the business is conducted as follows: A resident agent is employed for the purpose of making contracts for the sale and renting of machines in that county and that county only; machines are delivered to such agents and placed aboard wagons and taken by the agents into the \n\n[233 U.S. 304, 307]\n\u00a0\n rural districts for the purpose of soliciting customers either to purchase or to rent machines; when a buyer is found the machine is delivered by the agent to the customer, who either pays cash for it or executes an instalment note in which the company retains title to the machine, or an instalment note secured by a mortgage upon the machine and other property; such sale on credit is made subject to the approval of the company, and if not approved, the instalment note is returned to the maker and the machine returned to the company. If the agent makes a contract for the sale of the machine for cash, this also is subject to the approval or disapproval of complainant. The final consummation of all sales is at one of complainant's established places of business. The same agents are engaged also in renting machines and collecting the rent arising therefrom, and the greater portion of their time is consumed in such renting, this constituting at least 70 per centum of the business done by complainant in the state. Rented machines are placed aboard wagons and taken by the agents into the rural districts. Each of these agents is attached to some one of the stores or places of business operated by complainant, and the machines handled by the agent are sent to him from the place of business to which he is attached, or taken from that place of business by him upon the wagon which he drives. Besides this, complainant sells and rents machines at its regularly established places of business, and delivers such machines to the buyers or renters by the use of wagons and teams; and in those counties where complainant has established places of business, machines sold or rented at those places are delivered by the same agents and with the same wagons that are used in carrying machines into the rural districts. It is averred that the machines are of the average weight of 135 pounds. That there are many other merchants in the state who sell sewing machines of a different manu- \n\n[233 U.S. 304, 308]\n\u00a0\n facture at their places of business, and the average weight of these also is about 135 pounds; that on account of their weight it is the custom and practice of complainant, and of the other merchants also, to make delivery by the use of wagons and teams whether the sales are made at their places of business or otherwise, and that it is impracticable to conduct the business without delivery by wagon.\n With respect to the business conducted in Russell county, Alabama, it is averred that complainant operates a regularly established place of business in the city of Columbus, Georgia, where sewing machines and accessories are kept for sale, and in connection with this business agents are employed to deliver machines and accessories in Russell county, which adjoins the Georgia state line; and that complainant does not sell or deliver any sewing machines or accessories in Russell county except in the following manner, namely: Its agents use wagons and teams in going about and displaying sample machines, and thereby obtain orders for machines and accessories, which orders are transmitted by the agents to the complainant at Columbus, Georgia, for acceptance or rejection, and if accepted, the machines or other articles so ordered are taken out of stock there, placed upon wagons, and thereby delivered to the purchasers in Russell county.\n The bill is based upon the contention that  32 of the tax law violates the Constitution of the United States in that it is a regulation of interstate commerce, and contravenes the 'due process' and 'equal protection' clauses of the 14th Amendment, and also that it violates the Constitution of Alabama; and, finally, that appellant is within the exception of the statute.\n To the original bill (Prior to the amendments) demurrers were filed, and were sustained as to the whole bill except paragraph 6, which set forth the mode of conducting complainant's business in Russell county. As to this the court held that the facts showed a case of inter- \n\n[233 U.S. 304, 309]\n\u00a0\n state commerce, and that the act had no application to it. 199 Fed. 654.\n The amendments having been made, the amended bill was submitted upon the same demurrers, which were made to apply to the bill as amended. Again the court sustained the demurrers except as to paragraph 6, relating to Russell county, and as to this overruled them. Defendants then filed an answer admitting the allegations of paragraph 6, and the cause was submitted upon bill and answer, with the result that by final decree relief was accorded to complainant as to the license tax sought to be collected in Russell county, and in other respects relief was denied and the bill dismissed. Because of the constitutional questions, a direct appeal to this court was taken under Judicial Code,  238 [36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 228].\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Messrs. John R. Tyson, Henry Axtell Prince, and W. A. Gunter for appellant.\n\n\n[233 U.S. 304, 312]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert C. Brickell for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Pitney:\n With respect to the business conducted in Russell county, the decree of the district court is not now directly under review; but, at any rate, it was clearly correct under Crenshaw v. Arkansas, \n227 U.S. 389\n, 57 L. ed. 565, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 294. With respect to the other counties, the correctness of the decision, so far as the commerce clause is concerned, seems to us equally clear under Emert v. Missouri, \n156 U.S. 296\n, 39 L. ed. 430, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 68, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 367.\n But it is argued that the courts cannot properly sustain a statute which in direct terms applies to all commerce, by restricting it to cases of actual interference with interstate dealings. To quote from the brief: 'All such laws as will necessarily affect interstate commerce when it arises are void. We do not have to await actual results on actual commerce to pronounce them void. . . . And, of course, a statute of this character, which is void as a whole, from its unity of character, will as readily be so declared in a case in which only intrastate commerce may be actually involved as otherwise. The lower court was \n\n[233 U.S. 304, 313]\n\u00a0\n thus clearly in error in limiting the invalidity of the statute to the dealing in Russell county.'\n This argument, we think, misses the point. The statute under consideration does not in direct terms or by necessary inference manifest an intent to regulate or burden interstate commerce. Full and fair effect can be given to its provisions, and an unconstitutional meaning can be avoided, by indulging the natural presumption that the legislature was intending to tax only that which it constitutionally might tax. So construed, it does not apply to interstate commerce at all. The statute provides for a license or occupation tax. Normally, as the averments of the bill sufficiently show, the occupation may be and is conducted wholly intrastate, and free from any element of interstate commerce. The fact that, as carried on in Russell county, a like occupation is conducted with interstate commerce as an essential ingredient, is wholly fortuitous.\n Nor has the tax that 'unity of character' upon which the argument necessarily depends. The cases cited in support of the insistence that the act must be adjudged totally void because, if applied in Russell county, it would burden interstate commerce, are readily distinguishable. In United States v. Reese, \n92 \nU.S. 214, 221\n, 23 S. L. ed. 563, 565, there was a penal statute couched in general language broad enough to cover wrongful acts without as well as within the constitutional inhibition, and it was held that the court could not reject the unconstitutional part and retain the remainder, because it was not possible to separate the one from the other. In Trade-Mark Cases, \n100 \nU.S. 82, 99\n, 25 S. L. ed. 550, 553, the court upon the same principle declined to sustain in part a trademark law, so framed as to be applicable by its terms to all commerce, by confining it to the interstate commerce that alone was subject to the control of Congress. In Leloup v. Mobile, \n127 \nU.S. 640, 647\n, 32 S. L. ed. 311, 314, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 134, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1380, the court held a general license tax imposed by the state \n\n[233 U.S. 304, 314]\n\u00a0\n of Alabama upon the business of a telegraph company in part interstate and in part internal, to be unconstitutional, and held that since the tax affected the whole business without discrimination it could not be sustained with respect to that portion of the business that was internal and therefore taxable by the state. To the same effect are Norfolk & W. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n136 \nU.S. 114, 119\n, 34 S. L. ed. 394, 397, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 178, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 958; Crutcher v. Kentucky, \n141 \nU.S. 47, 62\n, 35 S. L. ed. 649, 654, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 851; Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Texas, \n210 U.S. 217\n, 52 L. ed. 1031, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638; Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1, 27\n, 54 S. L. ed. 355, 366, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190. In Williams v. Talladega, \n226 \nU.S. 404, 419\n, 57 S. L. ed. 275, 281, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 116, there was a state license tax that operated without exemption or distinction upon the privilege of carrying on a business, a part of which was that of an essential governmental agency constituted under a law of the United States. It was held that the tax necessarily included within its operation this part of the business, and since this was unconstitutional, the whole tax was rendered void.\n The statute now under consideration differs materially, in that it deals separately with the business as conducted in each county of the state, and provides for separate taxes to be laid for each county. And the facts as averred in the bill of complaint show that with respect to all of the counties in which appellant does business, excepting only the county of Russell, there is no element of interstate commerce. In each county there is a store or regular place of business, from which all of the local agents for the same county are supplied with sewing machines and appurtenances that are to be taken into the rural districts for sale or renting, and all transactions that enter into the sale or renting are completely carried out within a single county.\n It would be going altogether too far to say that appellant, being properly taxable, and without the least interference with interstate commerce, in twenty-nine counties of the state, could obtain immunity from all such taxation \n\n[233 U.S. 304, 315]\n\u00a0\n by establishing in one county a system of business that involved transactions in interstate commerce.\n So far as the 14th Amendment is concerned, the argument is confined to the 'equal protection' clause. It is said there is no sufficient ground for a distinction, with respect to taxing the occupation, between the business of selling sewing machines from a regularly established store and the business of selling them from a delivery wagon. But there is an evident difference, in the mode of doing business, between the local tradesman and the itinerant dealer, and we are unable to say that the distinction made between them for purposes of taxation is arbitrarily made. In such matters the states necessarily enjoy a wide range of discretion, and it would require a clear case to justify the courts in striking down a law that is uniformly applicable to all persons pursuing a given occupation, on the ground that persons engaged in other occupations more or less like it ought to be similarly taxed. This is not such a case. Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co. \n184 \nU.S. 540, 559\n, 562 S., 46 L. ed. 679, 689, 690, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431; Cook v. Marshall County, \n196 \nU.S. 261, 274\n, 49 S. L. ed. 471, 476, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 233; Armour Packing Co. v. Lacy, \n200 \nU.S. 226, 235\n, 50 S. L. ed. 451, 456, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 232; Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114, 121\n, 54 S. L. ed. 688, 692, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 496.\n In Quartlebaum v. State, 79 Ala. 1, a previous statute (subsec. 20 of  14, act of December 12, 1884; Session Acts 1884-85, p. 17), which imposed an annual license fee of $25 upon 'each sewing machine . . . company selling sewing machines . . . either themselves or by their agents, and all persons who engage in the business of selling sewing machines . . . but when merchants engaged in a general business keep sewing machines . . . they shall not be required to pay the tax herein provided,' was sustained against the criticism that it discriminated between two classes of persons engaged in the business of selling sewing machines, namely, between persons who were 'merchants engaged in a general business,' and persons not so engaged; \n\n[233 U.S. 304, 316]\n\u00a0\n the court saying as to the former: 'If sewing machines be part of their stock in trade they are taxed for them as for other merchandise. Their business is in its nature stationary, and there is little or no risk in levying taxes upon their business, on the rule of percent age. That rule may be wholly unsuited and ineffectual for other pursuits and other lines of business. Much must be left to the discretion of the legislature, for exact equality of taxation can never be reached.' And see Ballou v. State, 87 Ala. 144, 146, 6 So. 393.\n The contention that the statute violates the state Constitution is grounded upon two sections of the Bill of Rights, viz.,  1, 'That all men are equally free and independent; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;' and  37, 'That the sole object and only legitimate end of government is to protect the citizen in the enjoyment of life, liberty, and property, and when the government assumes other functions it is usurpation and oppression.'\n The bearing of these provisions upon the case in hand is not clear. The argument seems to be that since the tax law in question is not a police measure, but a revenue measure, the discriminations are arbitrary. To quote from the brief: 'Selling sewing machines is the business, and it is taxed highly, and it may be in fact prohibitorily, when it is done by the use of wagons and teams, and not at all when done at stores.' There are other suggestions of a like import. They seem to be sufficiently answered by what has been already said respecting the 'equal protection' clause of the 14th Amendment. The state has a wide range of discretion with respect to establishing classes for the purpose of imposing revenue taxes, and its laws upon the subject are not to be set aside as discriminatory unless it clearly appears that there is no rational basis for the classification. \n\n[233 U.S. 304, 317]\n\u00a0\n The cases cited from the state courts lend no support to appellant's argument. Mobile v. Craft, 94 Ala. 156, 10 So. 534; Tuscaloosa v. Holczstein, 134 Ala. 636, 32 So. 1007, and Gambill v. Endrich Bros. 143 Ala. 506, 39 So. 297, involved the construction of certain municipal charters and the powers of the respective municipalities thereunder, and have no direct bearing upon the present question. In Montgomery v. Kelly, 142 Ala. 552, 70 L.R.A. 209, 110 Am. St. Rep. 43, 38 So. 67, a municipal ordinance requiring each merchant who issued trading stamps in connection with his business to pay a license tax of $100, viewed in the light of another ordinance that fixed a license fee of $1,000 upon trading stamp companies, was held to be 'a palpable attempt under the guise of a license tax to fix a penalty on the merchant for conducting his business in a certain way,' and therefore unconstitutional. Mefford v. Sheffield, 148 Ala. 539, 41 So. 970, sustained a city ordinance that imposed a tax of $ 200 on wholesale dealers in illuminating oil, while fixing the license tax on dealers in goods, wares, or merchandise in general at $10. Alabama Consol. Coal & I. Co. v. Herzberg, 177 Ala. 248, 59 So. 305, declared unconstitutional  33A of the revenue act of March 31, 1911, p. 181, which undertook to impose upon persons, firms, or corporations conducting a store at which their employees trade on checks, orders, or the like, an annual license fee varying according to the number of persons employed; the court saying: 'The tax is not, therefore, imposed upon the business, or upon all engaged in a similar business, but is based solely upon the manner in which a party may conduct the business; and the foregoing section is repugnant to the state and Federal Constitutions under the authority of Montgomery v. Kelly, supra.'\n The other state decisions to which we are referred have been examined, and we are unable to find in them any basis for declaring  32 of the act to be in contravention of the state Constitution. \n\n[233 U.S. 304, 318]\n\u00a0\n Finally, it is said that since it appears from the averments of the bill that all sales of sewing machines by appellant's agents in the field are executory only, and require the approval of appellant at its regularly established places of business, located in the various counties of the state, which are headquarters for all agents with their wagons and teams, it at the same time sufficiently appears that appellant is a merchant conducting a regular business at each of said stores, and therefore within the saving clause of  32 of the act in question, which declares that 'this section shall not apply to merchants selling the above enumerated articles at their regularly established places of business.'\n It is quite plain, however, from a reading of the entire section, that the business of selling sewing machines by traveling salesmen is intended to be taxed, and the business of selling them at established places of business is intended to be left untaxed, so far as this section is concerned, although the machines sold at these places be delivered by wagons. Complainant is engaged in doing business of both kinds; and with respect to the itinerant sales it is subject to the tax under the section referred to.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","201":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSIOUX REMEDY CO. v. COPE(1914)\nNo. 37\nArgued: Decided: November 30, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 197, 198]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joe Kirby, C. E. More, and A. W. Bulkley for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Charles O. Bailey, John H. Voorhees, Alan Bogue, Jr., Andrew S. Bogue, Peter G. Honegger, and Theodore M. Bailey for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 197, 199]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action by an Iowa corporation to enforce payment of the purchase price, amounting to $80, of merchandise sold in interstate commerce under a written contract which was made in South Dakota, and required that the merchandise be shipped by the plaintiff from its place of business in Iowa to the defendants at their place of business and residence in South Dakota. The action was brought in a court of the latter state, and the defendants interposed a plea to the effect that the action could not be maintained because, as was the fact, the plaintiff had not complied with a South Dakota statute prescribing conditions upon which corporations of other states would be permitted to sue in the courts of that state. The plea was sustained and the action dismissed. An appeal to the supreme court of the state resulted in in a judgment of \n\n[235 U.S. 197, 200]\n\u00a0\n affirmance,1 from which one member of the court dissented. 28 S. D. 397, 135 N. W. 683.\n In that court it was contended that the statute upon which the plea was grounded is, when applied in a case like this, repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States.\n The statute (Rev. Civ. Code 1903) declares ( 883) that no corporation created under the laws of any other state or territory, for other than religious and charitable purposes, 'shall transact any business within this state, or acquire, hold, and dispose of property, real, personal, or mixed, within this state, or sue or maintain any action at law or otherwise in any of the courts of this state,' until it shall have filed in the office of the secretary of state an authenticated copy of its charter or articles of incorporation, and also ( 885) that 'no action shall be commenced or maintained in any of the courts of this state by such corporation on any contract, agreement, or transaction made or entered into in this state by such corporation,' unless it shall have appointed a resident agent upon whom process may be served in any action to which it may be a party, and shall have filed an authenticated copy of such appointment in the office of the secretary of state and of the register of deeds of the county where the agent resides. The corporation is also required to pay the fees, amounting to about $25, for filing and recording these instruments.\n The supreme court of the state construed the statute as requiring a foreign corporation to subject itself to the jurisdiction of all the courts of the state as a condition to invoking the aid of any one of them, and as embracing \n\n[235 U.S. 197, 201]\n\u00a0\n actions to enforce contracts directly arising out of and connected with interstate commerce equally with actions having no relation to such commerce; and after so construing the statute, the court held it to be a reasonable exercise of the police power of the state and in no wise repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. In two earlier cases the court had taken a different view of the statute ( Rex Buggy Co. v. Dinneen, 23 S. D. 474, 122 N. W. 433; Sioux Remedy Co. v. Lindgren, 27 S. D. 123, 130 N. W. 49), but in the opinion rendered in this case they were disapproved.\n Recognizing that it was within the province of the supreme court of the state to construe the statute, and to depart from prior decisions upon the subject, if deemed untenable, we accept the construction applied in this case, and confine our attention to the Federal question whether, as so construed, the statute, by its necessary operation, materially or directly burdens interstate commerce.\n Through a long series of decisions dealing with the scope and effect of the commerce clause it has come to be well settled that a state, while possessing power to adopt reasonable measures to promote and protect the health, safety, morals, and welfare of its people, even though interstate commerce be incidentally or indirectly affected, has no power to exclude from its limits foreign corporations or others engaged in interstate commerce, or, by the imposition of conditions, to fetter their right to carry on such commerce, or to subject them in respect to their transactions therein to requirements which are unreasonable or pass beyond the bounds of suitable local protection.

And so the solution of the question here presented lies within narrow lines.\n The contract and sale out of which the action arose \n\n[235 U.S. 197, 202]\n\u00a0\n were transactions in interstate commerce, and entirely legitimate notwithstanding the plaintiff's noncompliance with the state statute.

Vickers, \n226 U.S. 205\n, 57 L. ed. 189, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 41; Flint & W. Mfg. Co. v. McDonald, 21 S. D. 526, 14 L.R.A.(N.S.) 673, 130 Am. St. Rep. 735, 114 N. W. 684. After delivery of the merchandise according to the contract, the plaintiff was lawfully entitled to the purchase price. The defendants were likewise obligated to pay it. And by reason of their refusal the plaintiff had a right of action on the contract. Thus much was recognized by the supreme court of the state and is now conceded by counsel for the defendants. But it was held by that court, and is here contended, that while the state could not make noncompliance with the statute a ground for forbidding or invalidating sales in interstate commerce, it could make such noncompliance a ground for preventing the maintenance of any action in the courts of the state, based upon such a sale; in other words, that the state, although unable to condition the right to make the sale or its validity upon a compliance with the statute, could so condition the right to sue for the purchase price in the courts of the state.\n The argument advanced in support of this position is, first, that the right to demand and enforce payment for merchandise sold in interstate commerce is no part of such commerce, and therefore may be encumbered without burdening the latter; second, that a state may impose such conditions as it deems appropriate upon the right of foreign corporations to sue in its courts; and, third, that in any event the conditions imposed by the statute are not unreasonable or burdensome. The supreme court of the state sustained the second and third points and passed the other without comment.\n Of the first point it is enough to say that the right to demand and enforce payment for goods sold in interstate commerce, if not a part of such commerce, is so directly \n\n[235 U.S. 197, 203]\n\u00a0\n connected with it and is so essential to its existence and continuance that the imposition of unreasonable conditions upon this right must necessarily operate as a restraint or burden upon interstate commerce. The form or mode of imposing the conditions is not nearly so important as their necessary and practical operation, for, as was said in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1, 27\n, 54 S. L. ed. 355, 366, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190: 'If the statute, reasonably interpreted, either directly or by its necessary operation, burdens interstate commerce, it must be adjudged to be invalid, whatever may have been the purpose for which it was enacted, and although the company may do both interstate and local business. This court has repeatedly adjudged that in all such matters the judiciary will not regard mere forms, but will look through forms to the substance of things.'\n It may be conceded in a general way that a state may restrict the right of a foreign corporation to sue in its courts. Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 519, 589-591, 10 L. ed. 274, 308, 309; Anglo-American Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co. \n191 U.S. 373\n, 48 L. ed. 225, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 92. And in the same general way it may be conceded that a state may restrict the right of such corporations to engage in business within its limits. Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 19 L. ed. 357; Hooper v. California, \n155 U.S. 648\n, 39 L. ed. 297, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 610, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 207. But the power so to deal with these subjects, like all other state powers, can only be exerted within the limitations which the Constitution of the United States places upon state action. Missouri v. Lewis (Bowman v. Lewis) \n101 \nU.S. 22, 30\n, 25 S. L. ed. 989, 992; Blake v. McClung, \n172 \nU.S. 239, 256\n, 43 S. L. ed. 432, 438, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 165; Chambers v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. \n207 \nU.S. 142, 148\n, 52 S. L. ed. 143, 146, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 34; Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas, supra, p. 33; Southern R. Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400, 413\n, 54 S. L. ed. 536, 540, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 287, 19 Ann. Cas. 1247. One of these limitations is that before indicated, arising from the commerce clause, whose operation, as this court has said, is such that a corporation authorized by the state of its creation to engage in interstate commerce 'may not be prevented by another state from coming into its limits for all the legitimate \n\n[235 U.S. 197, 204]\n\u00a0\n purposes of such commerce.' Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas, supra, p. 27. We think that when a corporation goes into a state other than that of its origin to collect, according to the usual or prevailing methods, the purchase price of merchandise which it has lawfully sold therein in interstate commerce, it is there for a legitimate purpose of such commerce, and that the state cannot, consistently with the limitation arising from the commerce clause, obstruct or hamper the attainment of that purpose. If it were otherwise, the purpose of the Constitution to secure and maintain the freedom of commerce by whomsoever conducted could be largely thwarted by the states and the commerce itself seriously crippled.\n We are thus brought to the question whether the particular conditions imposed by this statute can be sustained when applied to rights of action like that disclosed in the present case. Without doubt a foreign corporation seeking to enforce such a right in the courts of a state may be required to conform to the prevailing modes of proceeding in those courts, and to submit to the usual rules respecting costs, the giving of security therefor (see Blake v. McClung, \n172 \nU.S. 239, 256\n, 43 S. L. ed. 432, 438, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 165), and the like. But incidents of this character commonly attending litigation may be put out of view, for it is with something quite different that we are here concerned. The conditions which the statute imposes are: First, that the company shall file in the office of the secretary of state an authenticated copy of its charter or articles of incorporation; second, that it shall appoint a resident agent upon whom process may be served in any action against it, and shall file a copy of such appointment in the office of the secretary of state and of the register of deeds of the county where the agent resides; and, third, that it shall pay the fees incident to filing and recording these instruments, approximating $25. It will be perceived that these are the conditions upon which many of the states permit foreign corporations to engage in busi- \n\n[235 U.S. 197, 205]\n\u00a0\n ness within their limits when no constitutional limitation is involved; that is, when the character of the business is such that the state is free to exclude such corporations or to admit them upon terms acceptable to it. But here the conditions are sought to be applied in a different way and to a different situation falling within the reach of the commerce clause. Out of this arises the question of their validity. We think the mere statement of the conditions shows that they have no natural or reasonable relation to the right to sue which they are intended to restrict. They have no bearing upon the merits or any question of procedure or costs, are not directed against any abusive use of judicial process, and are plainly onerous. The second one, respecting the appointment of a resident agent upon whom process may be served, is particularly burdensome, because, as the supreme court of the state has said, it requires the corporation to subject itself to the jurisdiction of the courts of the state in general as a prerequisite to suing in any of them; that is to say, it withholds the right to sue even in a single instance until the corporation renders itself amenable to suit in all the courts of the state by whosoever chooses to sue it there. If one state can impose such a condition others can, and in that way corporations engaged in interstate commerce can be subjected to great embarrassment and serious hazards in the enforcement of contractual rights directly arising out of and connected with such commerce. As applied to such rights we think the conditions are unreasonable and burdensome, and therefore in conflict with the commerce clause.\n These views require that the judgment be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] At the time of the allowance of the present writ of error the record had been sent to the circuit court of Turner county, and so the writ was directed to that court.

Grant Foreman and James D. Simms for defendant in error.\n\n\n[235 U.S. 441, 446]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was a suit to determine conflicting claims to an allotment selected and made after August 8, 1902, on behalf of Ellis Grayson, a Creek citizen duly entitled to enrolment, who died unmarried March 1, 1901, leaving as his only surviving relatives three first cousins, one on the paternal and two on the maternal side. All were Creek citizens. In the papers evidencing the selection and approval of the allotment, as also in the ensuing tribal deed, the beneficiaries were designated as the 'heirs' of the deceased, whthout otherwise naming them; and this was in accord with the usual practice. The suit was brought by the paternal cousin, who insisted that the title under the allotment and tribal deed passed to him alone. The others were made defendants and answered, asserting an exclusive right in themselves. Each side also advanced an alternative claim that the three took the land in equal parts. Two questions of law were involved: First, whether the beneficiaries were to be ascertained according to the Creek tribal law or according to an Arkansas law presently to be noticed; and, second, whether the governing law preferred either paternal or maternal relatives when all were of the same degree. The trial court, concluding that the tribal law was applicable and preferred maternal relatives, gave judgment for the defendants; but the supreme court of the state held that the Arkansas law was controlling and preferred paternal relatives, so the decision below was reversed, with a direction that judgment be entered for the plaintiff. 33 Okla. 169, 124 Pac. 615. The defendants then sued out this writ of error.\n Anterior to the legislation which we must consider, the Creek lands and funds belonged to the tribe as a community, and not to the members severally or as tenants in common. The right of each individual to participate in \n\n[235 U.S. 441, 447]\n\u00a0\n the enjoyment of such property depended upon tribal membership, and when that was terminated by death or otherwise the right was at an end. It was neither alienable nor descendible. Under treaty stipulations the tribe maintained a government of its own, with legislative and other powers, but this was a temporary expedient and in time proved unsatisfactory. Like other tribal Indians, the Creeks were wards of the United States, which possessed full power, if it deemed such a course wise, to assume full control over them and their affairs, to ascertain who were members of the tribe, to distribute the lands and funds among them, and to terminate the tribal government. This Congress undertook to do. The earlier legislation was largely preliminary and need not be noticed.\n The first enactment having a present bearing is that of March 1, 1901 ( 31 Stat. at L. 861, chap. 676), called the 'Original Creek agreement,' which went into effect June 25, 1901 (32 Stat. at L. 1971). It made provision for a permanent enrolment of the members of the tribe, for appraising most of the lands and allotting them in severalty with appropriate regard to their value, for using the tribal funds in equalizing allotments, for distributing what remained, for issuing deeds transferring the title to the allotted lands to the several allottees, and for ultimately terminating the tribal relation. In  28 this act directed that the enrolment, except as to children, should include 'all citizens who were living' on April 1, 1899, and entitled to enrolment under the earlier legislation, and then declared that 'if any such citizen has died since that time, or may hereafter die, before receiving his allotment of lands and distributive share of all the funds of the tribe, the lands and money to which he would be entitled, if living, shall descend to his heirs according to the laws of descent and distribution of the Creek Nation, and be allotted and distributed to them accordingly.' \n\n[235 U.S. 441, 448]\n\u00a0\n So much of that act as recognized the tribal laws of descent and distribution was repealed by the act of May 27, 19021 (32 Stat. at L. 258, chap. 888), which also provided: 'And the descent and distribution of lands and moneys provided for in said act [March 1, 1901] shall be in accordance with the provisions of chapter forty-nine of Mansfield's Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas in force in Indian Territory.' This was repeated, with a qualification not material here, in  6 of the act of June 30, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 500, chap. 1323), called the 'Supplemental Creek Agreement,' which went into effect August 8, 1902. See 32 Stat. at L. 2021; Marchie Tiger v. Western Invest. Co. \n221 \nU.S. 286, 301\n, 55 S. L. ed. 738, 743, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 578.\n Ellis Grayson was living April 1, 1899, and entitled to enrolment. Had he lived he would have been entitled, under the original agreement, to participate in the allotment and distribution of the tribal property. But he died March 1, 1901, before the agreement went into effect, and without receiving any part of the lands or funds of the tribe. In these circumstances the agreement contemplated that his heirs should take his place in the allotment and distribution, and should receive 'the lands and money to which he would be entitled, if living;' and it also contemplated that effect should be given to the Creek laws of descent and distribution in determining who were his heirs and in what proportions they were to take the property passed to them in his right. But, as before said, the act of May 27, 1902, and the supplemental agreement, repealed the provision giving effect to the Creek laws of descent and distribution, and substituted in their stead the laws of Arkansas embodied in chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest. This change went into effect before the allotment in question was selected or made, and has an important \n\n[235 U.S. 441, 449]\n\u00a0\n bearing here, because, according to the Creek laws,2 the maternal cousins were either the sole heirs or joint heirs with the paternal cousin, while according to the Arkansas laws3 the paternal cousin was the only heir.\n On the part of the maternal cousins it is contended that the provisions in the original agreement relating to the allotment and distribution of the tribal lands and funds were in the nature of a grant in proesenti, and invested every living member of the tribe and the heirs, designated in the tribal laws, of every member who had died after April 1, 1899, with an absolute right to an allotment of lands and a distributive share of the funds, and that Congress could not recall or impair this right without violating the due process of law clause of the 5th Amendment to the Constitution. To this we cannot assent. There was nothing in the agreement indicative of a purpose to make a grant in proesenti. On the contrary, it contemplated that various preliminary acts were to precede any investiture of individual rights. The lands and funds to which it related were tribal property, and only as it was carried into effect were individual claims to be fastened upon them. Unless and until that was done Congress possessed plenary power to deal with them as tribal property. It could revoke the agreement and abandon the purpose to distribute them in severalty, or adopt another mode of distribution, or pursue any other course which to it seemed better for the Indians. And without doubt it could confine the allotment and distribution to living members of the tribe, or make any provision deemed more reasonable than the first for passing to the relatives of deceased members the lands and money to which the latter would be entitled, if living. In short, the power of Congress was not exhausted or restrained by the \n\n[235 U.S. 441, 450]\n\u00a0\n adoption of the original agreement, but remained the same thereafter as before, save that rights created by carrying the agreement into effect could not be devested or impaired. Choate v. Trapp, \n224 \nU.S. 665, 671\n, 56 S. L. ed. 941, 944, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 565.\n In principle it was so held in Gritts v. Fisher, \n224 U.S. 640\n, 56 L. ed. 928, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 580. There an act or agreement of 1902 had made provision for allotting and distributing the lands and funds of the Cherokees in severalty among the members of the tribe who were living on September 1, 1902, and an act of 1906 [34 Stat. at L. 137, chap. 1876] had directed that Cherokee children born after September 1, 1902, and living on March 4, 1906, should participate in the allotment and distribution. By enlarging the number of participants the later act operated to reduce the distributive share to which each would be entitled, and because of this the validity of that act was called in question, the contention being that the prior act confined the allotment and distribution to the members living on September 1, 1902, and therefore invested them with an absolute right to receive all the lands and funds, and that this right could not be impaired by subsequent legislation. This court rejected the contention and said (p. 648): 'No doubt such was the purport of the act. But that, in our opinion, did not confer upon them any vested right such as would disable Congress from thereafter making provision for admitting newly born members of the tribe to the allotment and distribution. The difficulty with the appellants' contention is that it treats the act of 1902 as a contract, when 'it is only an act of Congress and can have no greater effect.'

DILL(1914)\nNo. 56\nArgued: Decided: November 30, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles J. Kappler and Charles H. Merillat for plaintiff in error.\n No appearance for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n Whether an allotment of lands in the Creek Nation, which was made on behalf of Archie Hamby, a Creek child then deceased, passed the lands to his heirs free from restrictions upon alienation, is the Federal question in this case. The facts out of which the question arises are these: Archie Hamby was born in February, 1900, and died in \n\n[235 U.S. 206, 207]\n\u00a0\n July, 1901, being survived by his parents and by at least one sister. His mother was a Creek woman, duly enrolled as such in 1895, and his father was a white man, not entitled to enrolment. Two or three years after the child's death his name was regularly placed upon the roll of Creek citizens by the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, and the lands in question were duly embraced in an allotment made on his behalf. A deed for them was also issued in his name, and this, by operation of law, vested the title in his heirs. In September, 1905, after the allotment was made, his parents, acting through an attorney in fact, appointed a few days before, executed and delivered to L. S. Skelton a warranty deed for the lands, and in July, 1906, the parents, apparently ignoring the deed to Skelton, executed and delivered to S. M. Wilson a similar deed. Whatever rights Wilson acquired under his deed subsequently passed to William H. Dill.\n The action in the court of first instance was in ejectment, and was brought by Dill against Skelton, who had gone into possession under his deed. Dill prevailed and the judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state, which held that when the deed to Skelton was made the lands were subject to restrictions upon alienation which rendered the deed void, and that at the time of the deed to Wilson, under which Dill was claiming, the restrictions had been removed, thereby rendering that deed valid. 30 Okla. 278, 119 Pac. 267.\n The allotment was made under the act of March 1, 1901, 31 Stat. at L. 861, chap. 676, as modified and supplemented by the act of June 30, 1902, 32 Stat. at L. 500, chap. 1323. These acts embodied and adopted a plan for allotting and distributing the lands and funds of the Creek Nation in severalty among its citizens, and to that end required that an enrolment be made by the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes of all citizens who were entitled to participate in the allotment and distribution. It being necessary to fix a date \n\n[235 U.S. 206, 208]\n\u00a0\n as of which the enrolment should be made, the original act provided, in  28, that the enrolment should embrace all qualified citizens who were living on April 1, 1899, and all children born to such citizens up to and including July 1, 1900, and living on that date. The supplemental act changed the latter date by declaring, in  7 and 8, that the enrolment should include all children born up to and including May 25, 1901. Evidently anticipating that participation in the allotment and distribution might in some instances be cut off by death, Congress made provision for such a contingency. Thus the original act declared, in  28: 'And if any such citizen has died since that time [April 1, 1899], or may hereafter die, before receiving his allotment of lands and distributive share of all the funds of the tribe, the lands and money to which he would be entitled, if living, shall descend to his heirs . . . and be allotted and distributed to them accordingly.' And the supplemental act provided, in  7 and 8: 'And if any such child has died since May 25, 1901, or may hereafter die, before receiving his allotment of lands and distributive share of the funds of the tribe, the lands and moneys to which he would be entitled if living shall descend to his heirs as herein provided, and be allotted and distributed to them accordingly.'\n Both parties are claiming under deeds from the father and mother, so we pass the question of who were the true heirs of the deceased child, observing only that under  6 of the supplemental act, in the circumstances before stated, the mother was and the father was not a lawful heir.\n In immediate connection with the provisions respecting allotments to living citizens in their own right, the original act contained a provision ( 7) imposing various restrictions upon the alienation of the allotted lands. But, aside from its relation to other parts of the act, that provision need not be noticed, for it was superseded by  16 of the supplemental act, which reads as follows: \n\n[235 U.S. 206, 209]\n\u00a0\n 'Lands allotted to citizens shall not in any manner whatever, or at any time, be encumbered, taken, or sold to secure or satisfy any debt or obligation, nor be alienated by the allottee or his heirs, before the expiration of five years from the date of the approval of this supplemental agreement, except with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. Each citizen shall select from his allotment forty acres of land, or a quarter of a quarter section, as a homestead, which shall be and remain nontaxable, inalienable, and free from any encumbrance whatever for twenty-one years from the date of the deed therefor, and a separate deed shall be issued to each allottee for his homestead, in which this condition shall appear. Selections of homesteads for minors, prisoners, convicts, incompetents, and aged and infirm persons, who cannot select for themselves, may be made in the manner provided for the selection of their allotments, and if for any reason such selection be not made for any citizen, it shall be the duty of said Commission to make selection for him. The homestead of each citizen shall remain, after the death of the allottee, for the use and support of children born to him after May 25, 1901; but if he have no such issue, then he may dispose of his homestead by will, free from the limitation herein imposed, and if this be not done, the land embraced in his homestead shall descend to his heirs, free from such limitation, according to the laws of descent herein otherwise prescribed. Any agreement or conveyance of any kind or character violative of any of the provisions of this paragraph shall be absolutely void, and not susceptible of ratification in any manner, and no rule of estoppel shall ever prevent the assertion of its invalidity.'\n Whether these restrictions were intended to apply only to allotments made to living citizens in their own right, or to apply as well to allotments made on behalf of deceased members, is the question for decision. The supreme court of the state, when passing upon this case, held \n\n[235 U.S. 206, 210]\n\u00a0\n them applicable to both classes of allotments, but in the later case of Rentie v. McCoy, 35 Okla. 77, 128 Pac. 244, reached the other conclusion, as did also the district court for the eastern district of Oklahoma in Reed v. Welty, 197 Fed. 419. We think the better reasoning lies with the view that the restrictions apply only to allotments made to living citizens in their own right. Not only do the provisions of  16 of the supplemental act lend themselves to that view, but in those sections of both acts which deal with allotments on behalf of deceased persons there is no suggestion of a restriction upon alienation. This difference in legislative treatment doubtless was deliberate, and reflects a corresponding difference in purpose. In Mullen v. United States, \n224 U.S. 448\n, 56 L. ed. 834, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 494, a like question arose under the original and supplemental acts relating to the Choctaw and Chickasaw lands, and we held that the restrictions upon alienation imposed by those acts were applicable to allotments to living members in their own right, but not to allotments on behalf of members then deceased. We do not perceive anything in the acts relating to the Creek lands which calls for a different conclusion.\n The judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","204":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMITH v.

There is no claim in the brief for the state that he was not competent to perform the duties of that position. On the contrary, it affirmatively and without contradiction appeared that the plaintiff in error, like other locomotive engineers, was familiar with the duties of that position, and was competent to discharge them with skill and efficiency.

If any person shall act or engage to act as a conductor on a railroad train in this state without having for two (2) years prior thereto served or worked in the capacity of a brakeman or conductor on a freight train on a line of railroad, he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished by a fine of not less than $25 nor more than $500, and each day he so engages shall constitute a separate offense.\n Sec. 3. If any person shall knowingly engage, promote, require, persuade, prevail upon, or cause any person to do any act in violation of the provisions of the two preceding sections of this act, he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished by a fine of not less than $25 nor more than $500, and each day he so engages shall constitute a separate offense. [Tex. Laws 1909, chap. 46.] \n\n[233 U.S. 630, 636]\n\u00a0\n previously served for two years as conductor or brakeman on such trains. On that verdict he was sentenced to pay a fine, and the judgment having been affirmed, the case is here on a record in which he contends that the statute under which he was convicted violated the provisions of the 14th Amendment.\n\n 1. \nLife, liberty, property, and the equal protection of the law, grouped together in the Constitution, are so related that the deprivation of any one of those separate and independent rights may lessen or extinguish the value of the other three. In so far as a man is deprived of the right to labor, his liberty is restricted, his capacity to earn wages and acquire property is lessened, and he is denied the protection which the law affords those who are permitted to work. Liberty means more than freedom from servitude, and the constitutional guaranty is an assurance that the citizen shall be protected in the right to use his powers of mind and body in any lawful calling.\n If the service is public, the state may prescribe qualifications and require an examination to test the fitness of any person to engage in or remain in the public calling. Re Lockwood, \n154 U.S. 116\n, 38 L. ed. 929, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1082; Hawker v. New York, \n170 U.S. 189\n, 42 L. ed. 1002, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 573; Watson v. Maryland, \n218 U.S. 173\n, 54 L. ed. 987, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 644. The private employer may likewise fix standards and tests, but, if his business is one in which the public health or safety is concerned, the state may legislate so as to exclude from work in such private calling those whose incompetence might cause injury to the public. But, as the public interest is the basis of such legislation, the tests and prohibition should be enacted with reference to that object, and so as not unduly to 'interfere with private business, or impose unusual and unnecessary restrictions upon lawful occupations.' Lawton v. Steele, \n152 U.S. 137\n, 38 L. ed. 388, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 499.\n A discussion of legislation of this nature is found in Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Alabama, \n128 U.S. 98\n, 32 L. ed. 353, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 238, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 28, where this court sustained the validity of a statute which required \n\n[233 U.S. 630, 637]\n\u00a0\n all locomotive engineers to submit to an examination for color blindness, and then provided that those unable to distinguish signals should not act as engineers on railroad trains. That statute did not prevent any competent person from being employed, but operated merely to exclude those who, on examination, were found to be physically unfit for the discharge of a duty where defective eyesight was almost certain to cause loss of life or limb. Another case cited by the plaintiff in error is that of Dent v. West Virginia, \n129 U.S. 114\n, 32 L. ed. 623, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 231. The act there under review provided that no one except licensed physicians should be allowed to practise medicine, and declared that licenses should be issued by the state board of health only to those (1) who were graduates of a reputable medical college; (2) to those who had practised medicine continuously for ten years; or (3) to those who, after examination, were found qualified to practice. Ten years' experience was accepted as proof of fitness, but such experience was not made the sole test, since the privilege of practising was attainable by all others who, by producing a diploma or by standing an examination, could show that they were qualified for the performance of the duties of the profession. In answer to the contention that the act was void because it deprived the citizen of the liberty to contract and the right to labor, the court said no objection could be raised to the statutory requirements 'because of their stringency or difficulty. It is only when they have no relation to such calling or profession, or are unattainable by such reasonable study and application, that they can operate to deprive one of his right to pursue a lawful vocation.'\n The necessity of avoiding the fixing of arbitrary tests by which competent persons would be excluded from lawful employment is also recognized in Smith v. Alabama, \n124 \nU.S. 465, 480\n, 31 S. L. ed. 508, 513, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 804, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 564. There the act provided that all engineers should secure a license, and in sustaining the \n\n[233 U.S. 630, 638]\n\u00a0\n validity of the statute the court pointed out that the law 'requires that every locomotive engineer shall have a license, but it does not limit the number of persons who may be licensed, or prescribe any arbitrary conditions of the grant.' This and the other cases establish, beyond controversy, that, in the exercise of the police power, the state may prescribe tests and require a license from those who wish to engage in or remain in a private calling affecting the public safety. The liberty of contract is, of course, not unlimited; but there is no reason or authority for the proposition that conditions may be imposed by statute which will admit some who are competent and arbitrarily exclude others who are equally competent to labor on terms mutually satisfactory to employer and employee. None of the cases sustains the proposition that, under the power to secure the public safety, a privileged class can be created and be then given a monopoly of the right to work in a special or favored position. Such a statute would shut the door, without a hearing, upon many persons and classes of persons who were competent to serve, and would deprive them of the liberty to work in a calling they were qualified to fill with safety to the public and benefit to themselves.\n\n 2. \nThe statute here under consideration permits those who had been freight conductors for two years before the law was passed, and those who for two years have been freight conductors in other states, to act in the same capacity in the state of Texas. But barring these exceptional cases, the act permits brakemen of freight trains to be promoted to the position of conductor on a freight train, but excludes all other citizens of the United States from the right to engage in such service. The statute does not require the brakeman to prove his fitness, though it does prevent all others from showing that they are competent. The act prescribes no other qualification for appointment as conductor than that for two years the \n\n[233 U.S. 630, 639]\n\u00a0\n applicant should have been a brakeman on a freight train, but affords no opportunity to any others to prove their fitness. It thus absolutely excludes the whole body of the public, including many railroad men, from the right to secure employment as conductor on a freight train.\n For it is to be noted that under this statute, not only the general public, but also four classes of railroad men, familiar with the movement and operation of trains, and having the same kind of experience as a brakeman, are given no chance to show their competency, but are arbitrarily denied the right to act as conductors. The statute excludes firemen and engineers of all trains, and all brakemen and conductors of passenger trains. But no reason is suggested why a brakeman on a passenger train should be denied the right to serve in a position that the brakeman on a freight train is permitted to fill. Both have the same class of work to do, both acquire the same familiarity with rules, signals, and methods of moving and distributing cars, and if the training of one qualifies him to serve as conductor, the like training of the other should not exclude him from the right to earn his living in the same occupation.\n It is argued in the brief for the state that, in practice, brakemen on freight trains are generally promoted to the position of freight conductors, and then to the position of conductors on passenger trains. And yet, under this act, even passenger conductors of the greatest experience and highest capacity would be punished if they acted as freight conductors without having previously been brakemen.\n The statute not only prevents experienced and competent men in the passenger service from acting as freight conductors, but it excludes the engineer on a freight train,-even thought, under the rules of all railroads, the freight engineer now acts as conductor in the event the regular conductor is disable en route. This general cus- \n\n[233 U.S. 630, 640]\n\u00a0\n tom is a practical recognition of their qualification, and is founded on the fact that the engineer, by virtue of his position, is familiar with the rules and signals relating to the train's movement, and peculiarly qualified for the performance of the duties of conductor. If we cannot take judicial knowledge of these facts, the record contains affirmative proof on the subject. For, according to the testimony of the state's witness, 'acting as engineer on \n I understand the railroad business, and know that a locomotive engineer learns as much about how a freight train should be operated by a conductor as a brakeman or conductor. Acting as engineer on a freight train will better acquaint one with a knowledge of how to operate a freight train than acting as brakeman. Under the rules of all railroads, and of the Texas & Gulf Railway Company, the engineer is held equally responsible with the conductor for the safe operation of the train. All orders are given to the engineer as well as to the conductor. Every order sent to a conductor in a train is made in duplicate, and one copy of it is given to the conductor and the other to the engineer. It is a rule with railway companies that if anything should happen to disable the conductor, or in any way prevent his proceeding with his train, the engineer is to immediately take charge of the train and handle it into the terminal. The engineer is constantly with the train and knows all of the signals, knows how the couplings are made, knows how the cars are switched and distributed, and knows how they are taken into the train and transported from one place to another. An engineer is so constantly associated with all the work of a conductor on a freight train that he should know as much about how a freight train should be operated by a conductor as the conductor himself. All actions of the conductor that pertain to the safe operation of the train are being carried on in his presence and within his observation all the time. The matter of handling the way bills and ascertaining the destinations of the cars in his train is easy and plain, and it does not take a person that has had experience as a conductor to understand that part of his service. The way bills are plainly written and the destinations plainly given, and booking the waybills and delivering them with the cars is clerical, and can be done by anyone that can read and write and who has ordinary sense. Every act that is to be done by the engineer, and all of the conductor's acts with reference to this are in the view and observation of the engineer. \n\n[233 U.S. 630, 641]\n\u00a0\n a freight train would better acquaint one with the knowledge of how to operate a freight train than acting as brakeman.' And yet, though at least equally competent, the engineer is denied the right to serve as conductor, and the exclusive right of appointment and promotion to that position is conferred upon brakemen.\n\n 3. \nSo that the case distinctly raises the question as to whether a statute, in permitting certain competent men to serve, can lay down a test which absolutely prohibits other competent men from entering the same private employment. It would seem that to ask the question is to answer,- and the answer in no way denies the right of the state to require examinations to test the fitness and capacity of brakemen, firemen, engineers, and conductors to enter upon a service fraught with so much of risk to themselves and to the public. But all men are entitled to the equal protection of the law in their right to work for the support of themselves and families. A statute which permits the brakeman to act,- because he is presumptively competent,-and prohibits the employment of engineers and all others who can affirmatively prove that they are likewise competent, is not confined to securing the public safety, but denies to many the liberty of contract granted to brakemen, and operates to establish rules of promotion in a private employment.\n If brakemen only are allowed the right of appointment to the position of conductors, then a privilege is given to them which is denied all other citizens of the United States. If the statute can fix the class from which conductors on freight trains shall be taken, another statute could limit the class from which brakeman and conductors on passenger trains could be selected, and so, progressively, the whole matter as to who could enter the railroad service, and who could go from one position to another, would be regulated by statute. In the nature of the case, promotion is a matter of private business management, and \n\n[233 U.S. 630, 642]\n\u00a0\n should be left to the carrier company, which, bound to serve the public, is held to the exercise of diligence in selecting competent men, and responsible in law for the acts of those who fill any of these positions.\n\n 4. \nThere was evidence that Smith safely and properly operated the train which had in it cars containing freight destined for points in Texas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kansas. But in view of what has been said it is not necessary to consider whether the plaintiff, as engineer, was in a position to raise the point that, under the decision in the Adams Express Case (Platt v. New York, \n232 U.S. 35\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 209) the statute interfered with interstate commerce. The judgment is reversed and the case remanded to the Court of Criminal Appeals of the State of Texas for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice Holmes dissents. \n\n\n\n","205":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN R.

The action was based upon the Federal employers' liability act of April 22, 1908 ( chap. 149, 35 Stat. at L. 65, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1322), in connection with the safety appliance act of March 2, 1893 (chap. 196, 27 Stat. \n\n[234 U.S. 725, 728]\n\u00a0\n at L. 531, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3174), and the amendments of 1896 and 1903 (chap. 87, 29 Stat. at L. 85, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3175; chap. 976, 32 Stat. at L. 943, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1314). He recovered a judgment in the trial court, which was affirmed by the court of civil appeals. A petition for a writ of certiorari being presented to the supreme court of Tennessee, that court dismissed the petition and affirmed the judgment.\n The facts, so far as material, are as follows: Defendant was an interstate carrier by railroad, and plaintiff was in its employ as a switchman, and was engaged in a movement of interstate commerce at the time he was injured. The date of the occurrence was October 15, 1910. In making up a freight train, a switch engine, with a freight car attached, was being moved down grade towards where other freight ears were standing upon the track, when the single car became uncoupled from the engine, and, being propelled by gravity towards the standing cars, came into contact with them. Plaintiff, being upon the car which thus became uncoupled, was by the impact thrown against the brake and injured. He insisted that the car became detached from the engine because of the defective condition of the track at that point, in conjunction with the insufficient height of the drawbar on the engine. There was evidence tending to show that the ground upon which the track rested was wet and marshy, and the cross-ties broken and insufficient, so that the track was uneven and rough, and that, as a result, the engine and the car attached to it were made to alternately rise and fall at the ends where they were coupled together; and tending further to show that the drawbar upon the engine, which was used in coupling the car to it, was not more than 30 inches high, measured from the track to the center of the drawbar; that it was too low to engage properly with the couplers of ordinary freight cars, and that, because of the resulting inadequacy of the coupling, together with the unevenness of the track, the car in question became detached. There was, however, evidence \n\n[234 U.S. 725, 729]\n\u00a0\n tending to show that plaintiff knew of the defective condition of the track and of the engine; that he had passed over the same track frequently with the same engine, and that prior, to the occurrence in question, cars had, as he knew, repeatedly become detached from the engine because of the conditions mentioned. It was either found or assumed by the state courts that defendant's railway was of standard gauge, and that the standard height of drawbars for freight cars ranged between a maximum of 34 1\/2 inches and a minimum of 31 1\/2 inches. See Resolution of Interstate Commerce Commission, June 6, 1893 (Ann. Rep. I. C. C. 1893, pp. 74, 263), construed in St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281, 289\n, 52 S. L. ed. 1061, 1065, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 616, 21 Am. Neg. Rep. 464, see also, Ann. Rep. I. C. C. 1896, p. 94. It should be noted that the alleged cause of action arose October 15, 1910, after the enactment of the amendment of that year to the safety appliance act, but before the taking effect of the Commission's order respecting drawbars, made pursuant to the new law. This order, while dated October 10, 1910, became effective on December 31 following.\n Defendant requested the trial court to direct a verdict in its favor, upon the ground that plaintiff admittedly knew of the defects and therefore assumed the risk. The court refused the motion, and likewise refused the request of defendant for an instruction to the jury in the following terms: 'If the jury should find from the evidence that the drawbar of the engine was defective by being too low, or the track defective, and that this caused the engine to become detached from the cars, and this caused the plaintiff's injury, still, if you should further find that these defective conditions had existed prior to that time with the knowledge of the plaintiff, and plaintiff knew before he went to work that the defect existed at that time, and that by reason thereof the engine had been accustomed to become uncoupled, and he appreciated the danger, then the court charges you that under those facts the plaintiff \n\n[234 U.S. 725, 730]\n\u00a0\n could not recover, and your verdict should be in favor of the defendant.'\n The contentions of defendant, overruled by each of the state courts and here renewed, are, that by the true interpretation of the employers' liability act, the common-law rule respecting the assumption of risk was not abolished except in cases where the violation by the carrier of some statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury of the employee; and that by the safety appliance act and amendments, as properly interpreted, the height or construction of the drawbars of locomotives was not regulated, so that the fact that the drawbar in question was only 30 inches high was not a violation of these acts, and hence afforded no ground for a recovery under the employers' liability act.\n There is a motion to dismiss, based upon the insistence that the record presents no question reviewable in this court under  237, Judicial Code (act of March 3, 1911, chap. 231, 36 Stat. at L. 1156, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 227). The motion must be overruled, upon the authority of St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281, 293\n, 52 S. L. ed. 1061, 1067, 28 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 635.\n Upon the merits, we of course sustain the contention that by the employers' liability act the defense of assumption of risk remains as at common law, saving in the cases mentioned in  4, that is to say: 'Any case where the violation by such common carrier of any statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury or death of such employee.'

Supp. 1911, p. 1314.\n'Be it enacted, etc., that the provisions and requirements of the act entitled, 'An Act to Promote the Safety of Employees and Travelers upon Railroads by Compelling Common Carriers Engaged in Interstate Commerce to Equip Their Cars with Automatic Couplers and Continuous Brakes, and Their Locomotives with Driving-wheel Brakes, and for Other Purposes,' approved March second, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, \n\n[234 U.S. 725, 733]\n\u00a0\n to be hauled or used on its line any car used in moving interstate traffic not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars,' was broad enough to embrace locomotive engines within the description 'any car.' This conclusion was based upon the declared purpose of Congress to promote the safety of employees and travelers upon railroads engaged in interstate commerce, and the specific intent to require the installation of such an equipment that the cars would couple with each other automatically by impact, and obviate the necessity of men going beween them either for coupling or for uncoupling.

And it was said that this amendment was affirmative and declaratory of the meaning attributed by the court to the prior law.\n\n In Schlemmer v. Buffalo, R. & P. R. Co. \n205 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, 51 S. L. ed. 681, 685, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 407, it was held that a shovel car was within the contemplation of  2.\n In Southern R. Co. v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20, 26\n, 56 S. L. ed. 72, 74, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 2, 3 N. C. C. A. 822, it was held that the 1903 amendment had enlarged the scope of the original act so as to embrace all locomotives, cars, and similar vehicles used on any railway that is a highway of interstate commerce, whether the particular vehicles were at the time employed in interstate commerce or not.\n In Pennell v. Philadelphia & R. R. Co. \n231 U.S. 675\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 220, the question was whether the provision respecting automatic couplers was applicable to the coupling between the locomotive and the tender. This was answered in the negative, the court saying (p. 678): 'Engine and tender are a single thing; separable, it may be, but never separated in their ordinary and essential use. The connection between them, that is, between the engine and tender, it was testified, was in the nature of a permanent coupling, and it was also testified that there was practically no opening between the engine and tender, and that attached to the engine was a drawbar which fitted in the \n\n[234 U.S. 725, 735]\n\u00a0\n yoke of the tender, and the pin was dropped down to connect drawbar and yoke. The necessary deduction from this is that no dangerous position was assumed by an employee in coupling the engine and tender, for the reason that the pin was dropped through the bar from the tank of the tender.'\n In each of these cases, the letter of the act was construed in the light of its spirit and purpose, as indicated by its title no less than by the enacting clauses. The same guiding principle should be adhered to in considering the question now presented. Conceding that it may be doubtful whether the act, in its original form, evidenced an intent on the part of Congress to standardize the height of drawbars upon vehicles other than freight cars, and therefore assuming for argument's sake that the act was not in this respect applicable to locomotive engines, it seems to us that the amendment of 1903, manifestly enacted for the purpose of broadening the scope of the original act, must, upon a fair construction, be deemed to extend its provisions and requirements respecting the standard height of drawbars, so as to make them applicable to locomotives, excepting such as are in terms exempted.\n There was abundant reason for applying the standard to locomotives. The drawbar-sometimes called the 'drawhead'-carries at its outer end the device or mechanism for coupling the cars. The height of the drawbar determines the height of the coupler, and has an intimate relation not only to the safety of the coupling operation, but to the security of the coupling when made. See Car Builders Dict. (1884), title, 'Drawbar' and 'Drawhead,' and Figs. 395-643; Voss, Railway Construction (1892) pp. 16, 91, etc. The evidence in this case shows, without contradiction, that the gripping surface of the coupling knuckle on the freight car in question, measured vertically, was between 7 and 9 inches, and that \n\n[234 U.S. 725, 736]\n\u00a0\n because of the comparatively low level of the engine's drawbar the effective grip was reduced to the point of practical inefficiency. Indeed, it is not seriously disputed that there exists as much reason for having the drawbars of the locomotive adjusted to a standard of height as exists in the case of freight cars.\n The experience of the Interstate Commerce Commission, in seeing to the enforcement of the act of 1893, tended to emphasize the importance of interchangeable equipment upon the rolling stock of railroads engaged in interstate commerce, so that cars used in such commerce would readily couple with cars not so used, and that locomotives could be readily coupled with cars of either sort. The 16th Annual Report of the Commission, 1902, p. 61, recommended to Congress, inter alia: 'That provisions relating to automatic couplers, grab irons, and the height of drawbars, be made to apply to all locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles, both those equipped in interstate commerce and those used in connection therewith (except those trains, cars, and locomotives exempted by the acts of March 2, 1893, and April 1, 1896).' This recommendation appears to have been evoked by the decision of the circuit court of appeals in Johnson v. Southern P. Co. 54 C. C. A. 508, 117 Fed. 462, 12 Am. Neg. Rep. 398, afterwards reversed by this court in \n196 U.S. 1\n, 49 L. ed. 363, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 158, 17 Am. Neg. Rep. 412. The court of appeals held that there was nothing in the act of 1893 to require a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce to have every car on its railroad equipped with the same kind of coupling, or to require that every car should be equipped with a coupler that would couple automatically with every other coupler with which it might be brought into contract; and also that the act did not forbid the use of an engine not equipped with automatic couplers. Congress not only responded to the recommendation of the Commission, but enlarged the act more broadly by enacting (amendment of March 2, 1903, set forth in footnote, \n\n[234 U.S. 725, 737]\n\u00a0\n supra) that the provisions and requirements of the original act should be held (a) to apply to common carriers by railroad in the territories and the District of Columbia; (b) to apply in all cases, whether or not the couplers brought together are of the same kind, make, or type; (c) that 'the provisions and requirements . . . relating to train brakes, automatic couplers, grab irons, and the height of drawbars, shall be held to apply to all trains, locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce, and in the territories and the District of Columbia, and to all other locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles used in connection therewith,' excepting those exempted by the act of March 2, 1893, as amended April 1, 1896, and those used upon street railways. We have to do especially with the latter clause. As was intimated in Southern R. Co. v. United States, \n222 U.S. 25\n, 50 L. ed. 74, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 2, 3 N. C. C. A. 822, its collocation of phrases is not altogether artistic. But at least the purpose is plain that where one vehicle is used in connection with another, that portion of the equipment of each that has to do with the safety and security of the attachment between them shall conform to standard. We cannot assent to the argument that the clause means only that the locomotives used upon all railroads engaged in interstate commerce and in the territories and the District of Columbia are to be equipped with the appliances provided by the original act for locomotives, and so on with the other classes of cars, and that hence the amendatory act has merely the effect of prescribing the standard height of drawbars with respect to freight cars, because the original act required such a standard only with respect to cars of that type. This would give altogether too narrow a construction to the language employed by Congress, and would lose sight of the spirit and purpose of the legislation. We deem the true intent and meaning to be that the provisions and requirements \n\n[234 U.S. 725, 738]\n\u00a0\n respecting train brakes, automatic couplers, grab irons, and the height of drawbars shall be extended to all railroad vehicles used upon any railroad engaged in interstate commerce, and to all other vehicles used in connection with them, so far as the respective safety devices and standards are capable of being installed upon the respective vehicles. It follows that by the act of 1903 the standard height of drawbars was made applicable to locomotive engines as well as to freight cars. And so it was held by the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit in Chicago, M. & P. S. R. Co. v. United States, 116 C. C. A. 444, 196 Fed. 882, 884.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Safety Appliance Act of March 2, 1893, chap. 196, 27 Stat. at L. 531, U. S. Comp.

McMaster for defendant in error. \n\n[233 U.S. 80, 85]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action under the employers' liability act of April 22, 1908, chap. 149, 35 Stat. at L. 65, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1322, for causing the death of the plaintiff's intestate. The plaintiff got a verdict for $25,000, on which the court ordered judgment upon the plaintiff's remitting $5,000. Exceptions were taken, but the judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 98 S. C. 42, 79 S. E. 710. The exceptions related to the instructions of the court on the matter of liability, and to the entering of judgment upon a verdict alleged to be excessive. As to rulings of the former class, we have indicated that then the statute is made a ground for bringing up ordinary questions of negligence, we shall deal with them in a summary way, and usually content ourselves with stating results. Whether such questions are open in a case coming from a state court we need not decide, as, if open, they can be disposed of in a few words.\n The defendant was killed by the falling of his engine through a burning trestle bridge. There was evidence tending to show that the trestle was more or less rotten, that the fire was caused by the dropping of coals from an earlier train, and that the engine might have been stopped had a proper lookout been kept. The first complaint is against an instruction to the effect that, if a servant is injured through defective instrumentalities, it is prima facie evidence of the master's negligence, and that the master 'assumes the burden' of showing that he exercised due care in furnishing them. Of course the burden of \n\n[233 U.S. 80, 86]\n\u00a0\n proving negligence in a strict sense is on the plaintiff throughout, as was recognized and stated later in the charge. The phrase picked out for criticism did not controvert that proposition, but merely expressed in an untechnical way that, if the death was due to a defective instrumentality and no explanation was given, the plaintiff had sustained the burden. The instruction is criticized further as if the judge had said res ipsa loquitur-which would have been right or wrong according to the res referred to. The judge did not say that the fall of the engine was enough, but that proof of a defect in appliances which the company was bound to use care to keep in order, and which usually would be in order if due care was taken, was prima facie evidence of neglect. The instruction concerned conditions likely to have existed for some time (defective ash pan or damper on the engine and rotten wood likely to take fire), about which the company had better means of information than the plaintiff, and concerning which it offered precise evidence, which, however, did not satisfy the jury. We should not reverse the judgment on this ground, even if an objection was open to an isolated phrase to which no attention was called at the time.\n The supposed error most insisted upon is the entering of judgment upon a verdict said to be manifestly excessive. It is admitted that the judge charged the jury correctly, according to principles established by Michigan C. R. Co. v. Vreeland, \n227 U.S. 59\n, 57 L. ed. 417, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 192, but it is thought to be apparent as matter of law that the jury found more than the charge or the law allowed. The argument is this: The deceased was making not more than $900 a year, and the only visible ground of increase was the possibility that he might be promoted from fireman to engineer, with what pay was not shown. He could not have given more than $ 700 a year to his family. His expectation of life was about thirty years by the tables of mortality. Therefore at the legal rate of interest the income from $10,000 \n\n[233 U.S. 80, 87]\n\u00a0\n for thirty years was all that the plaintiff was entitled to, whereas she was given the principal of $20,000 out and out. It may be admitted that if it were true that the excess appeared as matter of law,-that if, for instance, the statute fixed a maximum and the verdict exceeded it,-a question might arise for this court. But a case of mere excess upon the evidence is a matter to be dealt with by the trial court. It does not present a question for re-examination here upon a writ of error. Lincoln v. Power, \n151 U.S. 436\n, 38 L. ed. 224, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 387; Herencia v. Guzman, \n219 \nU.S. 44, 45\n, 55 S. L. ed. 81, 82, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 135. The premises of the argument for the plaintiff in error were not conclusive upon the jury, and although the verdict may seem to us too large, no such error appears as to warrant our imputing to judge and jury a connivance in escaping the limits of the law.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","207":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN RY.

The cause of action was expressly based \n\n[233 U.S. 572, 576]\n\u00a0\n upon the employers' liability act, it being averred that at the time of the injury the plaintiff, as an employee of the defendant, was assisting in the actual movement of interstate commerce transportation in which the defendant company was then engaged. The case is here on error prosecuted by the railway company to a judgment of the court below affirming a judgment of the trial court upon a verdict. 207 Fed. 277.\n In Chicago Junction R. Co. v. King, \n222 U.S. 222\n, 56 L. ed. 173, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 79, it was held that as the pleadings in that case based the right to recover upon an act of Congress, the safety appliance law, there was power in this court to review the judgment of a circuit court of appeals,-an authority which carried with it the duty to consider and pass upon all questions for decision in the case, even although they might not concern the interpretation of the act of Congress upon which the suit was based. But while thus ruling, it was nevertheless declared that, as questions of common-law negligence not involving the interpretation of the statute fell within the classes of questions which, under the distribution of judicial power made by the act of 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 826, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 488] (re-expressed in the Judicial Code) were determinable by the circuit court of appeals in last resort, where such questions were brought here from a circuit court of appeals because they arose in a suit under the statute, and which for that reason alone could come here, whilst considering we would not reverse as to such questions unless it clearly appeared that error had been committed. Besides establishing this rule, it was further said that, in disposing of such questions, we would not feel it our duty to re-state the case and re- expound the principles applicable to its decision below, but would, as a general rule, leave those subjects where the circuit court of appeals had left them, and\n The employers' liability act of April 22, 1908, 35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1322, as amended April 5, 1910, 36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1324. \n\n[233 U.S. 572, 577]\n\u00a0\n would hence content ourselves with merely expressing our ultimate conviction of the case as formed after an adequate examination of the record. The principles announced in the King Case were subsequently expressly reiterated and applied in Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Moore, \n228 U.S. 433\n, 57 L. ed. 907, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 580, and Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Brown, \n229 U.S. 317\n, 57 L. ed. 1204, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 840, 3 N. C. C. A. 826. And in both of these latter cases it was recognized that the ruling in the King Case was equally applicable to cases brought here from the circuit court of appeals on the ground that the relief sought was based on the employers' liability act where the cause of action arose since the adoption of the Judicial Code.\n Coming to the case made by this record, although, as we have said, it is manifest that the cause of action was based upon the employers' liability act, we are of the opinion that it presents for decision no question concerning the interpretation of that act, since all the questions which require to be decided merely involve considerations of general law depending in no sense upon the particular significance of the employers' liability act. Under these conditions it is apparent that the case is absolutely controlled by the King Case, and we therefore content ourselves with saying that, as after an adequate examination of the record we find no ground whatever affording a clear conviction that error was committed, affirmance must follow.\n This disposes of the entire case; but as it is insisted that two propositions which it is asserted involve the meaning of the employers' liability act arose upon the record and require to be decided, we come not to decide the propositions, but to point out the absolute want of merit in the contention that they arose on the record for decision. The first contention is based upon the refusal of a request made by the defendant to take the case from the jury by a peremptory instruction. Granting that, in its ultimate analysis, the request involved an appreciation of the \n\n[233 U.S. 572, 578]\n\u00a0\n employers' liability act, nevertheless we are of opinion that the absolute want of merit in the proposition, in view of the state of the proof, caused the request, intrinsically considered, to be so unsubstantial and frivolous as not to furnish any support for the contention that its refusal raised a question concerning the interpretation of the statute.\n The second contention rests upon the assumption that the court below affirmed a supposed action of the trial court in erroneously instructing the jury that the effect of the employers' liability act was to abolish the doctrine of assumption of risk. The proposition is thus stated in the opening sentences of the argument of the plaintiff in error: 'They trial judge held that said employers' liability act abolished the defense of assumed risk, so that the construction of the act is here involved.' A brief statement of the condition of the record on the subject is necessary to demonstrate the entire want of foundation for the proposition. The plaintiff was a locomotive fireman, and the controversy in the case was whether the personal injury which he suffered was occasioned by the reckless and negligent conduct of the engineer in moving the engine under the circumstances disclosed by the proof. In its general charge, the court had instructed the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover if they believed the testimony of the plaintiff, which disclosed an unusual and reckless movement of the engine by the engineer after he had directed the fireman to descend from the engine to ascertain whether there was a defect in its mechanism. Coming, then, to consider special charges asked by the respective parties, the court gave a charge requested by the plaintiff, as follows: 'If you believe from the evidence that the plaintiff was directed by the engineer Hunter to get off the engine and examine the engine for defects, then, while said plaintiff was obeying the direction of Hunter, it was Hunter's duty to look out for plaintiff, and not move \n\n[233 U.S. 572, 579]\n\u00a0\n the engine until he knew that plaintiff was in a position of safety.' Upon the giving of this charge the defendant excepted as follows: 'I want to take exception to that last statement on the ground that the fact that he moved up that engine if he was in a place of safety is not stated to be any cause of action in this case, and not involved in the pleadings, and he was not injured by virtue of it.' And the counsel added: 'We further except to the statement that the court made to the jury (evidently referring to the general charge) that if they believed the facts as stated by the plaintiff, which left out of question the doctrine of assumed risk.' In response to which the court said: 'I understand that the doctrine of assumed risk is abolished by the employers' liability act, in so far as relates to cases wherein the servant is injured because of the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees, etc., of the carrier, and contributory negligence is modified so as that it no longer bars the right of action, but goes in reduction of the amount of recovery. But you reserve your exception.' From this statement it is evident that no charge whatever was given by the court concerning the assumption of risk, and hence that no exception was or could have been taken to any such charge, and that the exception which was reserved concerned the special charge as to the conduct of the engineer and the portion of the general charge concerning liability if the testimony of the plaintiff as to the negligence of the engineer was believed, the exception as to the latter having been placed on the ground that the court had been silent as to assumption of risk. And it is equally clear that this view is not affected by taking into account the reply of the court to the comment of counsel. We say this because, while the reply echoed the counsel's mistaken use of the words 'assumed risk,' by the qualification which is affixed to these words, it elearly conveyed that as the matiters words, it clearly conveyed that as the matters purely concerned the common-law \n\n[233 U.S. 572, 580]\n\u00a0\n principles of fellow servant and contributory negligence, they were controlled by the provisions of the statute. And this becomes certain when it is borne in mind that there was nothing in that portion of the general charge which was excepted to which, in any possible view, was relevant to the doctrine of assumption of risk. If there were room for the slightest doubt on the subject it is dispelled by the following considerations: (a) because the record contains no intimation of any request for instruction concerning assumption of risk made by the defendant; (b) because although the elaborate application for a new trial stated many alleged grounds, not the slightest reference was made to any supposed error committed with reference to the mistaken construction of the statute concerning assumption of risk which is now relied upon; (c) because while, in the assignments of error made for the purpose of review by the circuit court of appeals, the special charge in connection with which the colloquy between court and counsel took place was referred to, and error assigned concerning it for specified reasons, no reference was made to the alleged mistake which is now relied upon concerning the wrongful interpretation of the statute as to assumption of risk. It may indeed be inferred that in the argument in some form alleged error on such subject was called to the attention of the circuit court of appeals, since that court, in its opinion, considered and disposed of the subject by directing attention to the qualifying words used in the remarks of the trial judge, and to the fact that, as assumption of risk was not at all involved in the testimony to which the charge related, no prejudicial error could have arisen. Certain is it, however, that in the assignments of error made for the purposes of review by this court, no complaint whatever was made of the alleged mistake concerning the operation of the statute upon the doctrine of assumed risk.\n Before coming to order the judgment of affirmance \n\n[233 U.S. 572, 581]\n\u00a0\n which is the necessary result of what we heve said, we briefly state the considerations which lead us to the conclusion that our duty is, in directing such judgment, to award interest by way of damages for delay under the terms of the second paragraph of rule 23. It is manifest on the face of the record that the case was carefully and fully considered in both of the courts below. In view of the ruling in the King Case and or what we have said concerning the contentions advanced to support the assertion that the interpretation of the statute was here involved, we think the conclusion that the writ of error was prosecuted only for delay is plainly justified, and that a penalty by way of damages should be imposed. The judgment below is therefore affirmed with 5 per cent upon the amount of the judgment in addition to the interest allowed by law.\n Affirmed with interest and 5 per cent damages. \n\nFootnotes\n 32 Sup.

NORWOOD(1914)\nNo. 119\nArgued: Decided: December 7, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 350, 351]\n\u00a0\n The attorney general of Arkansas, proceeding under act No. 112, approved March 23, 1911, entitled, 'An Act for an Annual Franchise Tax on Corporations Doing Business in the State of Arkansas' (Acts of Arkansas, 1911, p. 67), brought this suit in one of the courts of the state to recover a tax levied against the St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company by the state tax commission under the provisions of that act for the year 1911, amounting to the sum of $6,798.26, besides a penalty and interest.\n The act is one of three that were passed by the general assembly during the same year, designed for the purpose of obtaining revenue from corporations doing business in the state. The first of these is act No. 87, approved March 8 (Acts 1911, p. 48), which prescribes the fees to \n\n[235 U.S. 350, 352]\n\u00a0\n be paid by domestic corporations for the filing of their articles of incorporation, and by foreign corporations for the privilege of doing intrastate business in Arkansas. Its 8th section requires railroad and other transportation companies organized under the laws of the state to pay incorporation fees based upon the mileage of their lines; and, by  9, 'All foreign railroad, street, interurban, or other transportation companies now doing intrastate business, or desiring to engage in intrastate business, or authorized to engage in intrastate business, shall, before being permitted to continue to do intrastate business, or authorized to engage in intrastate business, shall pay the same fees as are required of such domestic corporations.'\n Act No. 112 provides for what are called 'annual franchise taxes' on corporations doing business in the state. The first three sections refer to domestic corporations doing business for profit. Sections 4 and 5 require each foreign corporation for profit doing business in the state, and owning or using a part or all of its capital or plant in the state, to make an annual return to the tax commission, showing, among other things, the total amount of its capital stock, the market value of the same, and the value of property owned and used by it, within and without the state, respectively. Section 6 provides that the commission, from the facts thus reported and any other facts bearing upon the question, shall determine 'the proportion of the authorized capital stock of the company represented by its property and business in this state,' and shall report the same to the auditor, who shall charge and certify to the treasurer for collection annually from such company, 'in addition to the initial fee otherwise provided by law, for the privilege of exercising its franchise in this state, 1\/20 of 1 per cent each year thereafter upon the proportion of the outstanding capital stock of the corporation represented by property owned and used in \n\n[235 U.S. 350, 353]\n\u00a0\n business transacted in this state.' Section 12 requires the attorney general to collect the tax with an added penalty for delinquency in payment, by suit to be brought in the name of the state. By  14 the tax and penalty are made a first lien upon all property of the corporation. By  15, if a corporation 'organized under the laws of Arkansas or any foreign country authorized to do business in this state for profit' fails or neglects to make the report or pay the tax prescribed for thirty days after the expiration of the time limited by the act, and the default is wilful and intentional, an action may be brought by the attorney general or prosecuting attorney to forfeit and annul the charter of the corporation, and 'if the court is satisfied that such default is wilful and intentional it shall revoke and annul such charter.' By  20, when any corporation shall have paid the franchise tax prescribed by the act, the tax commission, or the secretary of state if the commission be abolished, is required to issue to it a certificate authorizing it to do business in the state for the term of five years, upon condition that it pay annually the franchise tax prescribed by the act, and such certificate is made evidence in all the courts of the state of the right of the corporation to do business in the state during the term of the certificate. And, 'in case any corporation shall fail to pay the franchise tax prescribed by this act when it becomes due during the term of said certificate, the said tax commission shall cancel said certificate, and said corporation shall forfeit its right to do business in this state, in addition to the other penalties prescribed in this act.' By act No. 313, approved May 26, 1911, act No. 112 was amended with respect to the time of its taking effect, and in another particular not now pertinent.\n On May 4, the legislature passed act No. 251, entitled, 'An Act to Provide the Manner of Assessing for Taxation the Property of Railroads, Express, Sleeping Car, Telegraph, \n\n[235 U.S. 350, 354]\n\u00a0\n Telephone, and Pipe Lines Companies.' (Acts of Arkansas 1911, p. 233.) This provides that the property of railroad corporations, and of the others named in the title, shall be assessed by the tax commission. Section 2 is as follows:\n'Section 2. The franchise (other than the right to be a corporation) of all railroads, express, telegraph, and telephone companies, are declared to be property for the purpose of taxation, and the value of such franchises shall be considered by the assessing officers when assessing the property of such corporations. In valuing for assessment purposes the property of such corporations the Arkansas Tax Commission shall determine the total value of the entire property of the corporation, tangible and intangible.'\n\n Section 9 requires railroad companies to file with the tax commission statements showing their physical property in the state. Section 10 requires that the statement shall show 'the aggregate value of the whole railroad, and there shall be taken into consideration in fixing said value the entire right-of-way as given by the charter of the company or statutes of the state, the franchises, privileges, and everything of any character whatever situated upon the right-of-way of the road, connected with or appertaining to it in any way which adds to its earning power or gives the railroad value as an entire going thing.'\n The defendant, a Missouri corporation, owning and operating lines of railroad in the states of Missouri, Arkansas, and other states, over which it carries both intrastate and interstate commerce, made its report for the year 1911 in accordance with act No. 112, but under protest, reserving the right to contest the validity of the act. This report, among other things, showed that the total amount of authorized capital stock was $55, 000,000 and the total amount of issued and outstanding capital stock was $ 36,249,750. The commission found the \n\n[235 U.S. 350, 355]\n\u00a0\n proportion of the outstanding capital stock represented by property owned and used by defendant in business transacted in the state of Arkanas for the year 1911 to be $13,596,520, on which the franchise tax amounted to $6, 798.26.\n The complaint filed in behalf of the state herein set forth the making of the report by defendant as mentioned, and the taking of the necessary proceedings to fix its responsibility under the provisions of act No. 112.\n Defendant's answer, besides setting up its status as a railway corporation incorporated under the laws of Missouri owning and operating a railway line in Arkansas and several other states, and engaged as a common carrier in interstate business in those states, and also doing intrastate business in the state of Arkansas pursuant to its laws, averred that its property in that state was assessed for the purposes of general taxation for the year 1910 at the value of $9,155,965, and the tax levied thereon amounted to $191,713.95, which defendant paid; and that under act No. 251, approved May 4, 1911, the state tax commission assessed its property within the state for tax purposes for the latter year at the value of $11, 260,240, upon which assessment taxes had been levied in the sum of $239, 388.84, which defendant offered to pay (and has since paid), and averred that the tax sued on 'is a tax upon the privilege and right of this defendant to do both an interstate and intrastate business in the state of Arkansas, and is a tax upon the interstate business, property, and income of the defendant, and is a tax placed and imposed upon defendant for the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce, and an attempt to regulate interstate commerce, and a burden thereon; and that if said act is enforced defendant will be deprived of its right to engage in an interstate business in and through the state of Arkansas.' The answer also challenged the validity of act No. 112, as applied and attempted to be enforced against \n\n[235 U.S. 350, 356]\n\u00a0\n defendant, on the ground that it amounted to a taking of its property without due process of law and a denial of the equal protection of the laws.\n The attorney general's demurrer to this answer was sustained, and, the defendant declining to plead further, judgment was entered for the tax and penalty sued for.\n The supreme court of the state affirmed the judgment (106 Ark. 321, 152 S. W. 110), and the present writ of error was sued out.\n Messrs. William T. Wooldridge, Frank G. Bridges, Edward A. Haid, and Samuel H. West for plaintiff in error. \n\n[235 U.S. 350, 357]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William H. Rector, Thomas E. Helm, Lewis Rhoton, De E. Bradshaw, and Mr. William L. Moose, Attorney General of Arkansas, for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Pitney:\n\n\n[235 U.S. 350, 360]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The validity of act No. 112, and of the tax that, pursuant to its provisions, has been levied against plaintiff in error, is questioned on the ground of repugnancy to the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States and the 'due process' and 'equal protection' clauses of the 14th Amendment.\n The act is entitled, 'An Act for an Annual Franchise Tax on Corporations Doing Business in the State of Arkansas' (Acts of Arkansas, 1911, p. 67). Its 4th, 5th, and 6th sections require each foreign corporation for profit, doing business in the state, and owning or using a part or all of its capital or plant in the state, to pay 'for the privilege of exercising its franchise in this state, 1\/20 of 1 per cent each year thereafter upon the proportion of the outstanding capital stock of the corporation represented by property owned and used in business transacted in this state.' On the other hand, act No. 251, approved May 4, 1911 (Acts of Arkansas, p. 233), is entitled, 'An Act to Provide the Manner of Assessing for Taxation the Property of Railroads, Express, Sleeping Car, Telegraph, Telephone, and Pipe Lines Companies.' By its 2d section the franchises (other than the right to be a corporation) of all railroad, express, telegraph, and telephone companies are declared to be \n\n[235 U.S. 350, 361]\n\u00a0\n property for the purpose of taxation, and the values of such franchises are to be considered by the assessing officers when assessing the property of such corporations.\n The supreme court of the state, in its opinion herein, after reciting the pertinent provisions of the state Constitution, went on to say (106 Ark. 326): 'Our court has held that a corporation owes its existence to the state, and the right to enjoy this privilege is a subject of taxation, and that upon the power of the legislature to impose such a tax there exists no restriction in our Constitution. In the case of a foreign corporation, the tax or license is paid for the privilege of exercising its corporate powers in the state. Baker v. State, 44 Ark. 138, and cases cited.' (p. 327.) 'In the passage of the act in question [act No. 112], no doubt the legislature had in mind the fact that the right or privilege to be or exist as a corporation, although a matter of value to the stockholders of the corporation, is not an asset of the corporation, and transferable as such, and that its value cannot, under ordinary rules, be ascertained for the purpose of taxation as property, but since it is a privilege or right granted by the state, a franchise tax may be imposed upon this right or privilege for the purpose of raising revenue. We think it plain, then, under our Constitution and decisions, that the act in question is valid unless it be held a burden upon interstate commerce.' And, after citing certain decisions of this court bearing upon the latter question, the court proceeded (p. 329): 'In the case at bar the gross receipts from all sources of the railway company have not been used as a means for ascertaining the value of the property in the state. By the express provision of act No. 251, enacted for the purpose of providing the manner for assessing for taxation the property of railroad companies, the right to be or exist as a corporation was expressly excluded from the items which go to make up the value of the property of the corporation. As we have \n\n[235 U.S. 350, 362]\n\u00a0\n already seen, the right or privilege to be or exist as a corporation is the subject of taxation, and this right or privilege is not considered in fixing the value of the property of corporations under act No. 251, the general tax act. Our state has fixed a franchise tax based solely 'upon the proportion of outstanding capital stock of corporations represented by property owned and used in business transacted in this state.' The act in question seems to have been drawn with great care and with the evident purpose to exclude any contention that the tax was made upon interstate commerce. The framers of the act evidently considered the cases of Ludwig v. Western U. Teleg. Co. \n216 U.S. 146\n, 54 L. ed. 423, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 280, and Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 1\n, 54 L. ed. 355, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190, and therefore intended to pass an act that would not be contrary to the principles therein announced. We think it has done so. It will be noted in the Ludwig Case, the statute required a foreign corporation engaged in interstate commerce to pay as a license tax for doing intrastate business, a given amount on its capital stock, whether employed within the state or elsewhere, and the court held that on the authority of the Kansas Case, the statute in question was unconstitutional and void because it directly burdened interstate commerce and imposed a tax on property beyond the jurisdiction of the state.'\n Upon the mere question of construction we are, of course, concluded by the decision of the state court of last resort. But when the question is whether a tax imposed by a state deprives a party of rights secured by the Federal Constitution, the decision is not dependent upon the form in which the taxing scheme is cast, nor upon the characterization of that scheme as adopted by the state court. We must regard the substance, rather than the form, and the controlling test is to be found in the operation and effect of the law as applied and enforced by the state. Henderson v. New York (Henderson v. Wickham) \n92 \nU.S. 259, 268\n, 23 S. L. ed. 543, 547; Williams \n\n[235 U.S. 350, 363]\n\u00a0\n v. Mississippi, \n170 \nU.S. 213, 225\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1012, 1016, 18 Sup. Ct.

Co. \n216 \nU.S. 146, 162\n, 54 S. L. ed. 423, 429, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 288; Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, decided November 30, 1914, \n235 U.S. 197\n, 59 L. ed. --, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 57.\n We therefore accept the construction of act No. 112 that we have quoted from the opinion of the state court, which is, in short, that it imposes an annual franchise tax upon the right to exist as a corporation or to exercise corporate powers within the state, the amount of the tax being fixed solely by reference to the property of the corporation that is within the state and used in business transacted within the state, and excluding any imposition upon or interference with interstate commerce. By this we understand that the franchise of a foreign corporation that is intended to be taxed is that which relates solely to intrastate business; and this exposition of act No. 112 brings it into harmony with act No. 87 ( quoted in the prefatory statement), which requires foreign corporations to pay initial fees only for the privilege of doing intrastate business; and renders it harmonious, also, with act No. 251, under which the franchise of corporate existence is excluded from the assessment.\n And we proceed to consider whether, in view of the construction thus placed upon act No. 112, the franchise tax imposed upon plaintiff in error pursuant to its terms runs counter to the commerce clause or the 14th Amendment.\n The tax, as will be observed, is not in any wise based upon the receipts of the railroad company from interstate commerce, either taken alone or in connection with the receipts from its intrastate business. Since, therefore, the amount of the imposition is not made to fluctuate with the \n\n[235 U.S. 350, 364]\n\u00a0\n volume or the value of the business done, we are relieved from those difficulties that arise where state taxes are based upon the earnings of interstate carriers, as in Maine v. Grand Trunk R. Co. \n142 U.S. 217\n, 35 L. ed. 994, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 121, 163, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 807; Wisconsin & M. R. Co. v. Powers, \n191 U.S. 379\n, 48 L. ed. 229, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 107; Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Texas, \n210 U.S. 217\n, 52 L. ed. 1031, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 638; Meyer v. Wells, F. & Co. \n223 U.S. 298\n, 56 L. ed. 445, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 218; and United States Exp. Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 U.S. 335\n, 56 L. ed. 459, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 211.\n And we have no hesitation in overruling the contention that the tax is repugnant to the 'due process' clause on the ground of being in effect based on property located beyond the limits of the state, as in West ern U. Teleg. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1, 30\n, 54 S. L. ed. 355, 367, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190; and in Ludwig v. Western U. Teleg. Co. \n216 \nU.S. 146, 162\n, 54 S. L. ed. 423, 429, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 280; for this tax is measured by reference to property situate wholly within the confines of the state.\n So far as the commerce clause is concerned, it seems to us that the principles upon whose application the present decision must depend are those set forth in Postal Teleg. Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 \nU.S. 688, 695\n, 39 S. L. ed. 311, 315, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 1, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 268, where the court, by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, said: 'It is settled that where by way of duties laid on the transportation of the subjects of interstate commerce, or on the receipts derived therefrom, or on the occupation or business of carrying it on, a tax is levied by a state on interstate commerce, such taxation amounts to a regulation of such commerce and cannot be sustained. But property in a state belonging to a corporation, whether foreign or domestic, engaged in foreign or interstate commerce, may be taxed, or a tax may be imposed on the corporation on account of its property within a state, and may take the form of a tax for the privilege of exercising its franchises within the state, if the ascertainment of the amount is made dependent in fact on the value of its property situated within the state (the exaction, therefore, not being susceptible of exceeding the sum which might be leviable directly \n\n[235 U.S. 350, 365]\n\u00a0\n thereon), and if payment be not made a condition precedent to the right to carry on the business, but its enforcement left to the ordinary means devised for the collection of taxes.'\n So, in Atlantic & P. Teleg. Co. v. Philadelphia, \n190 U.S. 160\n, 47 L. ed. 995, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 817, the court, reviewing numerous previous cases, laid down certain propositions as well-established, and among them the following: (a) No state can compel a party, individual, or corporation, to pay for the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce; (b) this immunity does not prevent a state from imposing ordinary property taxes upon property having a situs within its territory, although it be employed in interstate commerce; and (c) the franchise of a corporation, although that franchise is the business of interstate commerce, is, as a part of its property, subject to state taxation, provided, at least, the franchise is not derived from the United States.\n Applying these principles, we have no difficulty in sustaining the tax in question as a legitimate imposition upon a foreign corporation with respect to its exercise of the privilege of transacting intrastate business in corporate form, the tax being based upon the amount and value of its property within the state. It is fixed at a definite percentage ( 1\/20 of 1 per cent) of 'the proportion of the outstanding capital stock of the corporation represented by property owned and used in business transacted in this state,' and the act provides machinery for ascertaining the market value of the entire capital stock, and striking a proportion between the value of the property owned and used by the corporation in the state and that owned and used by it outside of the state. In its essence the tax is not distinguishable from that which was sustained by this court in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Atty. Gen. \n125 U.S. 530\n, 31 L. ed. 790, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 961, and in another case between the same parties, \n141 U.S. 40\n, 35 L. ed. 628, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 889. See also Pittsburgh, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 421, 430\n, 435 S., 38 L. ed. 1031, 1039, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1114; Indianapolis & V. \n\n[235 U.S. 350, 366]\n\u00a0\n R. Co. v. Backus, \n154 U.S. 438\n, 38 L. ed. 1040, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1114; Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 439, 444\n, 445 S., 38 L. ed. 1041, 1045, 1046, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 677, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1122; Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Taggart, \n163 \nU.S. 1, 18\n, 41 S. L. ed. 49, 55, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1054; Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Missouri, \n190 \nU.S. 412, 424\n, 47 S. L. ed. 1116, 1121, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 730.\n It is insisted that act No. 112, as construed by the state court, in connection with act No. 251, subjects the property of plaintiff in error to double taxation, and that this contravenes the constitutional guaranties respecting due process of law and the equal protection of the laws. No attempt is made to show that the classification of corporations adopted in act No. 112 is not a reasonable one, or that in any respect corporations of the class to which plaintiff in error belongs are discriminated against in favor of domestic corporations, as was the case in Southern R. Co. v. Greene, \n216 U.S. 400\n, 54 L. ed. 536, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 287, 19 Ann. Cas. 1247. Under the first three sections of this act, each corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the state for profit is required to pay a tax of 1\/20 of 1 per cent upon 'that part of its subscribed or issued and outstanding capital employed in Arkansas,' with an exception not now pertinent; whereas, by the next three sections, each foreign corporation for profit doing business in the state, and owning or using a part or all of its capital or plant in the state, is required to pay according to the same percentage 'upon the proportion of the outstanding capital stock of the corporation represented by property owned and used in business transacted in this state.' It is not contended that there is here any substantial discrimination. The gist of the criticism seems to be that the two acts in question subject the property of plaintiff in error, as well as that of all other corporations that are within the operation of those acts, to double taxation, and that this is a denial of 'equal protection' in favor of other classes of taxpayers. Reference is made to an extract from the opinion in the Adams Case, \n155 U.S. 696\n, where the court said: 'Doubtless, no state could add to the taxation of prop- \n\n[235 U.S. 350, 367]\n\u00a0\n erty according to the rule of ordinary property taxation, the burden of a license or other tax on the privilege of using, constructing, or operating an instrumentality of interstate or international commerce, or for the carrying on of such commerce; but the value of property results from the use to which it is put, and varies with the profitableness of that use; and by whatever name the exaction may be called, if it amounts to no more than the ordinary tax upon property, or a just equivalent therefor, ascertained by reference thereto, it is not open to attack as inconsistent with the Constitution. Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 439, 445\n, 38 S. L. ed. 1041, 1046, 4 Inters. Comp. Rep. 677, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1122.' This, however, does not mean, as is contended, that because of the 14th Amendment a state may not, in addition to the imposition of an ordinary property tax upon an instrumentality of interstate or international commerce, impose a franchise tax ascertained by reference to the property of the corporation within the state, including that employed in interstate commerce. The court was dealing only with the commerce clause, and the language quoted means that, by whatever name the tax or taxes may be called that are fixed by reference to the value of the property, if they are not imposed because of its use in interstate or foreign commerce, and if they amount to no more than would be legitimate as an ordinary tax upon the property, valued with reference to the use in which it is employed, they are not open to attack; and that it is permissible to value the property at what it is worth in view of its use in interstate commerce, so long as no added burden is imposed as a condition of such use. This is evident from a reading of the context and from the reference made to the opinion in 154 U. S. at p. 445.\n Nothing in the 14th Amendment imposes any ironclad rule upon the states with respect to their internal taxation, or prevents them from imposing double taxation, or any other form of unequal taxation, so long as the in- \n\n[235 U.S. 350, 368]\n\u00a0\n equality is not based upon arbitrary distinctions. Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 \nU.S. 97, 105\n, 106 S., 24 L. ed. 616, 620; Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 33 S. L. ed. 892, 895, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 533; Pacific Exp.

Powers, \n201 \nU.S. 245, 293\n, 50 S. L. ed. 744, 761, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 459.\n Thus far we have dealt only with the authority of the state to levy a tax of this character, and with the mode in which the amount of the tax is ascertained. But the case presents another question that is more serious. By  20 of act No. 112 it is enacted: 'In case any corporation shall fail to pay the franchise tax prescribed by this act when it becomes due during the term of said certificate, the said, tax commission shall cancel said certificate, and said corporation sahll forfeit its right to do business in this state, in addition to the other penalties prescribed in this act.'\n If this must needs be construed to mean that for nonpayment of the franchise tax a foreign railroad corporation engage in business as a common carrier of intrastate and interstate commerce is to forfeit its right to do business in the state, not only with respect to intrastate but also with respect to interstate commerce, the effect would be to impose a condition upon its right to transact interstate commerce, and the act would be invalid, as amounting in effect to a regulation of that commerce; unless, indeed,  20 could be treated as separable. This result would follow from the principles laid down in Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Atty. Gen. \n125 \nU.S. 530, 554\n, 31 S. L. ed. 790, 795, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 961; Leloup v. Mobile, \n127 \nU.S. 640, 644\n, 647 S., 2 L. ed. 311, 313, 314, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 134, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1380; Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Alabama Bd. of Assessment (Western U. Teleg. v. Seay) \n132 \nU.S. 472, 477\n, 33 S. L. ed. 409, 410, 2 Inters. Com. Rep. 726, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 161; Allen v. Pullman's Palace Car Co. \n191 \nU.S. 171, 179\n, 48 S. L. ed. 134, 138, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 39, and many other cases.\n But the state court has not as yet construed the section \n\n[235 U.S. 350, 369]\n\u00a0\n as calling for the forfeiture of the privilege of doing interstate business in the event of nonpayment of the franchise tax; nor is the state here insisting upon such a construction. The present is an ordinary action to collect the tax as a debt, and not to forfeit the franchise for its nonpayment. Non constat but that the state court will hold, when confronted with the question, that the franchise to be forfeited pursuant to  20 is confined to intrastate commerce. Such a construction is clearly foreshadowed by what the court has in this case held with respect to the general purpose of the act. And in exercising the jurisdiction conferred by  237, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1156, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913 ,  1214], it is proper for this court to wait until the state court has adopted a construction of the statute under attack, rather than to assume in advance that such a construction will be adopted as to render the law repugnant to the Federal Constitution. Bachtel v. Wilson, \n204 \nU.S. 36, 40\n, 51 S. L. ed. 357, 359, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 243; Adams v. Russell, \n229 \nU.S. 353, 360\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1224, 1227, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 846; Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 531, 546\n, 58 S. L. ed. 713, 720, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 359. And see Ohio Tax Cases, \n232 \nU.S. 576, 591\n, 58 S. L. ed. 738, 745, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 372. At present, therefore, we have merely to consider whether  20 so clearly requires a forfeiture of the interstate franchise for nonpayment of the tax in question that it is not reasonable to anticipate that the state court will put another construction upon it. And in doing this we ought not to indulge the presumption either that the legislature intended to exceed the limits imposed upon state action by the Federal Constitution, or that the courts of the state will so interpret the legislation as to lead to that result. No canon of construction is better established or more universally observed than this: that if a statute will bear two constructions, one within and the other beyond the constitutional power of the law-making body, the courts should adopt that which is consistent with the Constitution, because it is to be presumed that the legislature intended to act within the scope of its authority.

W. 881.\n It does not seem to us that  20, when taken in connection with the context, requires to be so construed as to interfere with interstate commerce. The taxing provisions of the act apply to all corporations doing business in the state for profit, whether organized under its laws, or under the laws of other states, or of foreign countries, and entirely irrespective of the question whether they are engaged in commerce. Therefore it was natural that, in such a provision as is contained in  20, language having upon its face a general scope should be adopted; but it need not be indiscriminately applied to all the several kinds of corporations that are subject to the act. The forfeiture in terms is of 'the right of such corporation to do business in this state.' This does not necessarily include the right to transact business that is done partly within and partly without the state. The section does not call for an annulment of the charter. That topic is covered by  15 of the same act, which applies, however, only to corporations organized under the laws of Arkansas or of foreign countries, and not to corporations of other states, to which class plaintiff in error belongs.\n In view of all these considerations, we ought to assume, until the state, through its judicial or administrative officers, places a different construction upon the act, that  20 will be limited in its operation to forfeiting for nonpayment of the franchise tax only the privilege of doing intrastate business; or else that the section, being void for unconstitutionality, will be treated as severable from the other provisions of the act. Under either view it is ob- \n\n[235 U.S. 350, 371]\n\u00a0\n vious, from what has been already said, that the tax does not amount to a regulation of or a burden upon interstate commerce.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","209":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF ALABAMA v. SCHMIDT(1914)\nNo. 595\nArgued: January 12, 1914Decided: January 26, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 168, 169]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert C. Brickell, Attorney General of Alabama, and Mr. R. B. Evins for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 168, 170]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. K. Dixon and John P. Tillman for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 168, 172]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit brought by the state of Alabama to recover possession of a specified part of section 16, township 17, range 5, Talladega county. It was agreed that the land was a part of the 16th section school lands given to the state by the act of March 2, 1819, chap. 47,  6, 3 Stat. at L. 189, 491, and still belonged to the state if the defendant had not got a title by adverse possession, which it was agreed the defendant had if the statutes of Alabama, limiting suits like the present to twenty years, were valid. The trial court ruled that the statutes were falid, and ordered judgment for the defendant, and this judgment was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. -- Ala. --, 61 So. 293.\n We are of opinion that the judgment must be affirmed. The above- mentioned act of Congress, under which Alabama became a state, provided that section 16 in every township 'shall be granted to the inhabitants of such township for the use of schools.' Of course the state must admit, as it expressly agreed, that these words vested the legal title in it, since it relies upon them for recovery in the present case. Any other interpretation hardly would be reasonable. In some cases the grant has been to the state in terms; but in whichever way expressed, probably it means the same thing, so far as the legal title is concerned. Certainly it has the same effect with regard to the scope of the state's legal control.\n The argument for the plaintiff in error relies mainly upon Northern P. R. Co. v. Townsend, \n190 U.S. 267\n, 47 L. ed. 1044, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 671, which held that a right of way over public land \n\n[232 U.S. 168, 173]\n\u00a0\n granted by the United States for railway purposes could not be extinguished by adverse possession under the statute of limitations of the state in which the land lay. The ground of that decision was that the grant to the railroad was not a conveyance of the land in fee simple absolute, but a limited grant 'on an implied condition of reverter in the event that the company ceased to use or retain the land for the purpose for which it was granted.' This decision has been met for some similar cases elsewhere by the act of June 24, 1912, chap. 181, 37 Stat. at L. 138. Union P. R. Co. v. Laramie Stock Yards Co. \n231 U.S. 190\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 101; Union P. R. Co. v. Snow, \n231 U.S. 204\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 104. But it does not apply to a gift to a state for a public purpose of which that state is the sole guardian and minister. As long ago as 1856 it was decided 'the trusts created by these compacts relate to a subject certainly of universal interest, but of municipal concern, over which the power of the state is plenary and exclusive;' and it was held that the state of Michigan could sell its school lands without the consent of Congress. Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173, 15 L. ed. 338. This decision adverted to the fact that it had been unual for Congress to authorize the sale of lands if the state should desire it, but suggested that it was unnecessary (which, indeed, followed from what was decided) and thus met the further argument here pressed that a qualified permission to sell was given to Alabama by a much later act of March 2, 1827, chap. 59, 4 Stat. at L. 237. It also disposes of other forms of the same contention, that the state law impairs the obligation of its contract, or involves a breach of trust, supposing that such positions are open to the state to take. American Emigrant Co. v. Adams County, \n100 U.S. 61\n, 25 L. ed. 563; Spokane & B. C. R. Co. v. Washington & G. N. R. Co. \n219 U.S. 166\n, 55 L. ed. 159, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 182. The gift to the state is absolute, although, no doubt, as said in Cooper v. Roberts, 'there is a sacred obligation imposed on its public faith.' But that \n\n[232 U.S. 168, 174]\n\u00a0\n obligation is honorary, like the one discussed in Conley v. Ballinger, \n216 U.S. 84\n, 54 L. ed. 393, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 224, and even in honor would not be broken by a sale and substitution of a fund, as in that case; a course, we believe, that has not been uncommon among the states. See further Stuart v. Easton, \n170 \nU.S. 383, 394\n, 42 S. L. ed. 1078, 1082, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 650.\n Some reliance was placed upon Vincennes University v. Indiana, 14 How. 268, 14 L. ed. 416, but the decision of the majority in that case rested upon the grant having been made to a private corporation, of which the rights could not be impaired by the state.\n The result of Cooper v. Roberts and of what we have said is that the state has authority to subject this land in its hands to the ordinary incidents of other titles in the state, and that the judgment must be affirmed.

Rep. 388.\n The facts, briefly stated, upon which relief is asked, are these:\n The state, as a part of its economic policy, operates with its convicts three sugar plantations and three sugar mills. It is therefore a producer of sugar, which must find a market in competition with that imported from the Republic of Cuba and other sugar exporting countries.\n The petition avers that under the instructions of the defendant Treasury officials Cuban sugar, since March 1, 1914, the date upon which the Underwood tariff act became effective, is admitted into the United States at a rate of 1 1-100 cents per pound, being 80 per cent of 75 per cent of the rate of duty on sugar imposed by the Dingley tariff act of 1897 [30 Stat. at L. 151, chap. 11, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1626], which was 1 685-1000 cents per pound. The contention made is that the rate which should be collected on Cuban sugar is the rate imposed by the Dingley tariff bill, less a reduction of 20 per cent, making the net rate legally collectable 1 348-1000 cents per pound, as provided in the commercial treaty between the United States and the Republic of Cuba of December 11, 1902 [33 Stat. at L. 2136], as made effective by the act of Congress of December 17, 1903 (33 Stat. at L. p. 3, chap. 1, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 739), 'or, in the alternative, the duty on all such sugar imported into the United States should be 75 per cent of the Dingley bill rate, or 1 26-100 cents per pound, as provided . . . in the Underwood bill of October 3, 1913, without any preferential rate whatever being allowed in favor of said Cuban sugar.' \n\n[234 U.S. 627, 630]\n\u00a0\n Article 2 of the convention referred to provides that the products of the soil or industry of Cuba not included in article 1 'shall be admitted at a reduction of 20 per cent of the rates of duty . . . as provided by the tariff act of the United States approved July 24, 1897, or as may be provided by any tariff law of the United States subsequently enacted.' A proviso to article 8 is in these words:\n'That while this convention is in force, no sugar imported from the Republic of Cuba, and being the product of the soil or industry of the Republic of Cuba, shall be admitted into the United States at a reduction of duty greater than twenty per centum of the rates of duty thereon as provided by the tariff act of the United States approved July 24, 1897, and no sugar, the product of any other foreign country, shall be admitted by treaty or convention into the United States, while this convention is in force, at a lower rate of duty than that provided by the tariff act of the United States approved July 24, 1897.'\n\n The reduction in all sugar duties made by the tariff act of 1913, effective March 1, 1914, is 25 per cent upon the former rate of the Dingley bill, and the same act after May 1, 1916, provides for the free admission of all sugar.\n The contention seems to be that the proviso that no sugar shall be admitted into the United States at a reduction of duty greater than 20 per cent of the rate of duty provided by the Dingley act operates to prevent any reduction in favor of Cuban sugar after March 1, 1914, since the reduction made in duty on all imported sugar, including Cuban sugar, is 25 per cent of the Dingley rate, and that, as such reduction is more than the preferential under the Cuban convention, the preferential duty under that convention ceases. Upon the other hand, the contention is that the Underwood act manifested a plain purpose to continue a preferential of 20 per cent upon the reduced duties provided therein, a purpose manifested by the abrogation \n\n[234 U.S. 627, 631]\n\u00a0\n of the proviso of article 8 which might have interfered with such intent.\n It is not the purpose of the court to intimate any opinion upon the merits of the contentions thus presented, and we have only stated the opposing views far enough to enable us to decide whether the suit is or is not one against the United States.\n The petition proceeds by averring that the action of the defendant Treasury officials in instructing customs officers to admit Cuban sugar after March 1, 1914, at a reduction of 20 per cent of the rate effective on that date, was 'arbitrary, illegal, and unjust . . . and will work great and irreparable injury to your petitioner unless they are restrained and inhibited from demanding and collecting the said illegal charges on Cuban sugar imported into the United States; and another, and higher duty, as shown above, be exacted and collected by said officials on said sugar instead.' It is then contended that this direction to continue the allowance of a reduction of 20 per cent upon the reduced rates fixed by the Underwood act is such a flagrant exercise of arbitrary power as to make it the duty of a court of equity, upon application of anyone having a definite and distinct interest, to prohibit the allowance of the reduction and require the collection of the full duty imposed by the Underwood act, or, if any preferential be allowed, it be only upon the higher duty exacted by the act of 1897\n\n\n But what definite and distinct interest has the state of Louisiana whether the rate collected be too high or too low? She is a producer of sugar which must be sold in competition with foreign sugar, and the petition avers that the lowering of the duty upon Cuban sugar will lower the price for which she must sell her sugar yet unsold. But if Louisiana, as a mere producer and seller of sugar, may review the action of the Secretary of the Treasury in determining the rate to be collected on Cuban sugar, why \n\n[234 U.S. 627, 632]\n\u00a0\n may not any consumer, though not an importer, make a similar complaint if, in his judgment, the Secretary of the Treasury is exacting a higher rate than justified by the law, thereby enhancing the price he must pay in the market upon imported articles which he uses? Obviously such suits to review the official action of the Secretary of the Treasury in the exercise of his judgment as to the rate which should be exacted under his construction of the tariff acts would operate to disturb the whole revenue system of the government, and affect the revenues which arise therefrom. Such suits would obviously, in effect, be suits against the United States. Louisiana ex rel. New York Guaranty & I. Co. v. Steele, \n134 U.S. 230\n, 33 L. ed. 891, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 511; Louisiana v.

Rep. 654.\n There have always been remedies by which an importer may recover an excess rate of duty exacted from him by a customs collector, either by common-law action against the collector, as in Elliott v. Swartwout, 10 Pet. 137, 9 L. ed. 373, or by statute,  2931, Revised Statutes; act of June 10, 1890 (26 Stat. at L. pp. 131, 137, chap. 407, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1886); act of August 5, 1909 (36 Stat. at L. p. 11, chap. 6, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 741). But the claim that even an importer may complain, by appeal or otherwise, of the exaction of too low a rate of duty, seems not to have been asserted until 1912, when an appeal by an importer against an assessment as too low was sustained by the customs court of appeals, 3 Customs Appeal, 24, upon the theory that one might be aggrieved by an assessment too low as well as by one too high. But this decision did not meet with favor, and the remedy by appeal was confined to cases in which the duty imposed was claimed to be higher than authorized by existing law. Act of October 3, 1913 (38 Stat. at L. chap. 16,  3, part N).\n But we can discover no precedent where even an importer has sought to clog the wheels of government by reviewing the action of the Secretary of the Treasury by a bill such as this. \n\n[234 U.S. 627, 633]\n\u00a0\n The duties imposed upon the Secretary of the Treasury in the collection of sugar tariffs are not ministerial. They are executive, and involve the exercise of judgment and discretion. The facts show a situation in which the Secretary of the Treasury was confronted with the necessity of construing the law, and then instructing the customs officers as to whether the 20 per cent preferential duty on Cuban sugar required by the convention and the act of 1903 confirming that treaty had been superseded or in anywise affected by the later provisions of the Underwood act.\n By statute originally enacted in 1792 [1 Stat. at L. 280, chap. 37], now  249, Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 137), it is expressly provided that the Secretary of the Treasury is to 'superintend the collection of customs duties as he shall think best.' His interpretation of any custom law is made conclusive and binding upon all officers of customs, and upon his successors, until reversed by judicial decision. Rev. Stat.  2652, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1821; act March 3, 1875 (18 Stat. at L. p. 469, chap. 136,  2, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 137). In the discharge of his duties, semijudicial in character, the Secretary of the Treasury is, by statute, entitled to the opinion of the Attorney General, which, as we may judicially know, was obtained in this matter. Opinion of the Attorney General, Feb. 14, 1914, vol. 30, p. --.\n There is a class of cases which hold that if a public officer be required by law to do a particular thing, not involving the exercise of either judgment or discretion, he may be required to do that thing upon application of one having a distinct legal interest in the doing of the act. Such an act would be ministerial only. But if the matter in respect to which the action of the official is sought is one in which the exercise of either judgment or discretion is required, the courts will refuse to substitute their judgment or discretion for that of the official intrusted by law with its execution. Interference in such a case would be to interfere with the ordinary functions of government. \n\n[234 U.S. 627, 634]\n\u00a0\n Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, 137, 2 L. ed. 60; Kendall v.

Cobb et al.-\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Suit in equity instituted by the state of North Carolina, as complainant, against the state of Tennessee, as defendant, for the purpose of having settled and determined the true location of part of the boundary line between the two states.\n The pleadings consist of the original bill as amended, answer to the same, cross bill, and replication. Their \n\n[235 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n allegations need not be detailed. They accurately present the controversy between the parties and the relief prayed by each of them.\n The controversy concerns only a part of the line between the two states called, respectively, the Slick Rock and Tellico basins or territories. The contentions of the states are exhibited in general outline by the map on the opposite page.\n It is alleged by North Carolina 'that dispute and controversy have arisen as to the true location of the state line between the extreme height of the mountain northeasterly of Tennessee river and the main ridge thereof southwesterly of the river,' and she 'has always believed and acted upon the belief, and alleges the fact to be, that the line between these points descends from the extreme height of the mountain northeast of the river to the river, crosses the river to a point in the southwest bank thereof just west of the mouth of the stream known as Slick Rock creek, follows the creek a short distance to a ridge leading up to the main ridge, follows said ridge up to the summit known as Big Fodderstack mountain, and follows the main ridge thence to the junction of the Big Fodderstack and Hangover leads, and thence follows the main ridge of Unaka mountain southwesterly.'\n Tennessee denies that the line described by North Carolina is the true boundary line, alleges that North Carolina, at the time of filing her original bill, 'had not definitely determined how much of said boundary line she would dispute,' alleges an extension of 'the limits of the disputed zone,' that complainant does not allege that the boundary as run and marked by the commissioners in 1821 (their appointment and action will be referred to hereafter) follows other than the extreme height of the mountain, which is agreeably to the cession act of 1789 (given hereafter), and expresses a willingness that the line should be so marked and established in the \n\n[235 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n orders of this court, and denies that it can be established agreeably to the cession act in any other place than along the extreme height of the mountain from the Tennessee river.\n Further, Tennessee 'denies that there is any uncertainty in regard to that part of the boundary line northeast of the river, and avers that said boundary line northeast of the river runs, and was so marked by the commissioners in 1821, down the crest of the main ridge of the mountain, which gradually lowers as it approaches the river, and on said line near to or on the bank of said river, about a half a mile above the mouth of Slick Rock creek, a pine or hemlock tree was marked as a 'fore and aft tree,' which said tree is still standing, and is recognized as a 'fore and aft' boundary line tree bearing the marks placed thereon by the commissioners in 1821, and described in the North Carolina confirmatory act and the report of said commissioners, hereafter shown.' And avers 'that said boundary line as described in said cession act of 1789, and run by said commissioners in 1821, crossed directly over the Tennessee river from said 'fore and aft tree' to the crest of the main ridge of the mountain, which is known as the Hangover ridge or lead, and which runs from the Stratton Bald northeasterly to the river, lowering somewhat as it approaches the river, where it ends or terminates in a bluff practically opposite said marked 'fore and aft tree,' thence along the crest of said Hangover ridge or lead to said Stratton Bald and the junction of Hangover with Fodderstack, the Fodderstack ridge, however, being several hundred feet lower than said main or Hangover ridge.'\n To these contentions the proof is directed, the record of which is voluminous. Besides other evidence, it is replete with the disputes of experts and of opposing deductions from their testimony. These, however, have their determination if not their reconciliation in certain dom- \n\n[235 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n inating elements upon which our judgment may be rested.\n The territory constituting the state of Tennessee was ceded to the United States by North Carolina in 1789. In the act of cession the boundary line was, as described, from the French Broad river westerly as follows: 'Thence along the highest ridge of the said mountain [Iron mountain] to the place where it is called Great Iron mountain or Smoky mountain; thence along the extreme height of said mountain to the place where it is called Unicoi or Unaka mountain, between the Indian towns of Cowee and Old Chota; thence along the main ridge of such mountain to the southern boundary of this state.' A deed was made by North Carolina, in pursuance of the act of cession, in 1790, which followed the same description, as did also the act of Congress accepting the cession; also the Constitution of the state of Tennessee.\n In the year 1796 North Carolina passed an act appointing commissioners to settle the boundary line between the state and the state of Tennessee. The latter state also appointed commissioners with similar authority. In pursuance of the authority the commissioners appointed by the states settled the line from the east to a point on the Great Iron or Smoky mountain west of the Pigeon river, marked by a stone set up on the north side of the Cataloochee Turnpike road, about due north from the present town of Waynesville, in Heywood county, North Carolina, and about 6 miles east of the point where the Tennessee river passes through the mountain range, leaving the line to the southern boundary of the states unmarked.\n Subsequently each of the states (North Carolina in 1819, Tennessee in 1820) passed acts appointing commissioners, to meet with commissioners appointed by the other, 'and with them to settle, run, and mark the boundary line between' the states 'agreeably to the true in- \n\n[235 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n tent and meaning' of the cession act. In the act of North Carolina it was provided that 'this state will at all times hereafter ratify and confirm all and whatsoever the said commissioners, or the majority of those of each state, shall do, in and touching the premises, and the same shall be binding on this state;' and Tennessee enacted 'that whatsoever the said commissioners, or those appointed by each state, shall do in and touching the premises, shall be binding on this state.'\n Three commissioners were appointed by each state, who met and proceeded to the execution of their duties, and made report thereon to the respective states as follows:\n'Having met at the town of New Port in the State of Tennessee on the 16th day of July A. D. 1821, to settle, run and mark the dividing line between the two States, from the termination of the line run by McDowell, Vance and Matthews in the year of our Lord 1799, to the Southern Boundary of the said States, Respectfully Report, That we proceeded to ascertain, run and mark the said dividing line as designated in the 11th article called the Declaration of Rights, of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee, and in the Act of General Assembly of the State of North Carolina; entitled 'An act for the purpose of ceding to the United States of America certain Western lands' therein described, passed in 1789:-Which said dividing line as run by us, Begins at a stone set upon the north side of the Catalochee Turnpike road, and marked on the West Side of Ten. 1821; and the East side N. C. 1821, running thence a southwesterly course to the Bald Rock on the summit of the Great Iron or Smoky Mountain and continuing southwestwardly on the extreme height thereof to where it strikes Tennessee River about seven miles above the old Indian Town of Tellassee, crossing Porters gap at the distance of twenty two miles from the beginning; passing Meig's boundary line at \n\n[235 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n thirty one and a half miles:-the Equonettly path at fifty three miles; and crossing Tennessee River at the distance of sixty five miles from the beginning. From Tennessee River to the main ridge and along the extreme height of the same to the place where it is called the Unicoy or Unaka Mountain, striking the old trading path leading from the Valley Towns to the Overhill towns, near the head of the West fork of Tellico River, and at the distance of ninety three miles from the beginning. Thence along the extreme height of the Unicoy or Unaka mountain to the southwest end thereof at the Unicoy or Unaka Turnpike road, where a corner stone is set up marked Ten. on the West side and N. C. on the East side; and where a Hickory tree is also marked on the South side Ten. 101 m. and on the North side N. C. 101 m. being one hundred and one miles from our beginning. From thence a due course South two miles and two hundred and fifty two poles to a Spruce Pine on the North Bank of Highwassee River, below the mouth of Cane Creek; thence up the said river the same course about one mile, and crossing the same to a Maple marked W. D. and R. A. on the South bank of the River; Thence continuing the same course due south Eleven miles and two hundred and twenty three poles to the Southern Boundary line of the States of Tennessee and North Carolina; making in all one hundred and sixteen miles and two hundred and twenty three poles from our beginning; and striking the Southern Boundary line twenty three poles West of a tree in said line, marked 72 m.-Where we set up a square post marked on the West Side Ten. 1821; on the East Side N. C. 1821; and on the South Side G. The said dividing line run by us in its whole length is distinctly marked with two chops and a blaze on each fore-and-aft tree, and three chops on each side line tree; and mile marked at the end of each mile; agreeably to the plats which accompanies this Report, and which plats and \n\n[235 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n Report are certified by us in Duplicate, one for each of said States, in the same words, marks and figures; which we respectfully submit to the Governors of the said States of Tennessee and North Carolina.'\n\n Each state ratified the line located by the commissioners, following in their respective enactments the description of the report of the commissioners, and North Carolina 'fully established, ratified, and confirmed' it 'as the boundary line between the states of North Carolina and Tennessee forever;' and Tennessee 'ratified, confirmed, and established' it 'as the true boundary line between this state and the state of North Carolina.'\n The instructions to the commissioners were 'to settle, run, and mark [ 'remark' are the words of the Tennessee act] the boundary line' between the states. The commissioners executed the duty and reported 'that we proceeded to ascertain, run and mark said dividing line.' The report gives the beginning and end of the line and the intermediate courses and objects, and concludes as follows: 'The said dividing line run by us in its whole length is distinctly marked with two chops and a blaze on each fore-and- aft tree and three chops on each side line tree; and mile marked at the end of each mile; agreeably to the plats which accompanies this Report; and which said plats and reports are certified by us in Duplicate, one for each of said States, in the same words, marks, and figures; which we respectfully submit to the Governors of the said States of Tennessee and North Carolina.'\n Each state by its legislature confirmed the report and declared the line as settled and run the boundary line between them, and, it is to be presumed, after due consideration.\n The immediate question, therefore, is, Where was the line run? And the answer would necessarily seem to be determined by the monuments, courses, and distances; and, if these in any way conflict, by the line as marked \n\n[235 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n by the commissioners, if it can be ascertained, and the plats which accompanied the report certified in duplicate.\n On the report of the commissioners no controversy was raised for years. It seemed to be certain, or rather was accepted as proof of what we may call for convenience the North Carolina contention. Tradition, supported, we think, by preponderating testimony, sustains it; and as early as 1836 it received some recognition from the legislature of Tennessee. In that year the state constituted a land district called the Ocoee district, and provided for laying it out into townships, fractional townships, etc., and also provided for the entry and granting of the lands. The surveyor general of the state, in accordance with the provisions of the legislation, surveyed and platted the lands, and the plat shows that he made Slickrock creek the eastern boundary of the district. North Carolina surveyed the lands in the disputed territory in 1851 and made grants in 1853\n\n\n Upon an entry made in 1882 under laws passed by Tennessee and a grant from said state in 1892 the first judicial controversy arose over the boundary line, and the contention of Tennessee was sustained. Belding v. Hebard, 43 C. C. A. 296, 103 Fed. 532.\n The opinion in the case was delivered by the late Mr. Justice Lurton, then a judge of the circuit court of appeals, and exhibits the usual care and ability of that learned justice. He enumerates the contentions of the parties, the elements of the contentions, compares and weighs the evidence adduced for their support, and concludes as follows:--\n'There has been, on the evidence in this record, no such long and continued recognition or acquiescence in the tentative line on Slick Rock creek as to justify this court in saying that it has been adopted as the actual line so long as to stand for a definition of the true and ancient boundary. The conclusions and findings of the \n\n[235 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n master upon the principal points in the case are not shown to have been so plainly erroneous as to justify us in overturning his conclusions as to the existence of the marked state-line trees on the Hangover, nor as to the fact that the Hangover was palpably the 'main ridge' called for in the commissioners' report and survey.\n\n'The case, on the whole, is one not free from doubts engendered by the existence of the marked line on Slick Rock creek and its apparent recognition by the Tennessee surveyor general as the state line. The result reached by the special master, and confirmed by a most careful and conscientious trial judge, is a result which, on the whole, is most consonant with the calls in the cession act and the subsequent confirmatory boundary acts. The evidence relied upon to deflect the boundary from the line so plainly described by both acts settling the boundary is not so conclusive as to require us to reverse the action of the circuit court. The decree will therefore be affirmed.'\n\n The antagonism of the evidence to the North Carolina contention is put with more emphasis in Stevenson v. Fain, 53 C. C. A. 467, 116 Fed. 147, where, considering the controversy as to Tellico territory, Mr. Justice Lurton, again speaking for the court, said:--\n'In Belding v. Hebard, supra, we had occasion to ascertain a portion of this dividing line, a few miles northeast of the part now in dispute. In that case we had evidence of two different lines, both probably run and marked by the joint commission. The line called the 'Slick Creek' line was the better marked line, but was a plain departure from the call to follow the 'main ridge.' There was an old marked line on the 'main ridge,' and, though not so well marked, had the great advantage of being supported by the calls for course and the call for the extreme height of the 'main ridge.' Under the evidence we held the latter to be the line 'run and marked' by the commission of 1821, and adopted by the \n\n[235 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n confirmatory acts of both states. In that case, as in this, we were confronted with the fact that the Tennessee Cherokee survey had stopped at the Slick Creek line, and in that way recognized that as the line. But upon the whole case we held that the evidence relied upon to pull the line away from the 'extreme height' of the 'main ridge' was insufficient. The marked difference between that case and this is, first, in the fact that the 'main ridge' called for in the confirmatory acts of 1821 was far more clearly ascertained than in the present case; and, secondly, there was in that case evidence that two lines had been run and marked and old state- line marks shown on both lines. The call for the 'main ridge' was, therefore, supplemented by the existence of artificial monuments, and this turned the scale over the other, although the more plainly marked line.'\n\n The 'main ridge' and the 'extreme height' thereof were considered by the court as dominant criteria, and that the calls of the cession act and of the confirmatory acts of the state and the line run by the commissioners established Hangover to be the main ridge, and yet it was said, in estimate of opposing evidence, the case was not free from doubt. And in affirming the judgment, deference was expressed to the finding of the special master and circuit court.\n We need not pause to weigh the evidence in that case. It is reproduced in this, but here there is further evidence which gives different probative quality to the circumstances which were considered controlling in that case. It may be true-indeed, it is so alleged by complainant-that the boundary line between the two states may be generally described as following the main ridge or watershed of the Allegheny mountain range, but it has many local names and the topography of the country made it far from indubitably clear where the boundary line of the states should be located. Commissioners were hence \n\n[235 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n appointed to locate it, and their appointment and the controversies and the litigation which have arisen demonstrate that there was room for a choice and judgment of location,-to be specific, of ridges. The states, we have seen, agreed to abide by the judgment of the commissioners, and to ascertain their judgment then is, as we have said, the inquiry in the case.\n The commissioners reported that they had distinctly marked the dividing line run by them in its whole length 'with two chops and a blaze on each fore-and-aft tree, and three chops on each side line tree; and mile marked at the end of each mile; agreeably to the plats which accompanies this Report, and which said plats and Report are certified by us in Duplicate, one for each of said States, in the same words, marks and figures.' These plats were not in the Hebard Case.\n According to the report of the commissioners, the plat was certified in duplicate, one for each state. It may be that the one filed with North Carolina was lost or destroyed when the Capitol building of the state was destroyed in 1832; that filed with Tennessee was discovered in 1903 or 1904 by the state Archivist among papers supposed to be worthless. Its authenticity is not questioned.\n In November, 1910, a book purporting to be the field notes of W. Davenport, the surveyor who accompanied the commissioners, was found by his grandson in an old desk or sideboard which belonged to Davenport in his lifetime. The first three pages of the book are in the handwriting of Davenport. Other pages of the book are not in his handwriting, but in that of his wife, who often acted as his amanuensis. However, here and there are corrections by Davenport. The original book was exhibited at the argument and showed the following:\n'W. Davenport's Field Book, July 18th 1821.\n\n'July 19th, 1821, began at the Catalucha track to run the line between the State of North Carolina and Tennes- \n\n[235 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n see. Marked a rock there on North Carolina side N. C. 1821 and on the other side T. E. N. 1821-and runs with the line that J. McDowell, M. Matthews and D. Vance run in the year 1799, and runs with said line about 2 miles and a half to where they stopped.' Then follow the courses and distances, with trees by name of kind and other physical objects.\n\n These documents are variously interpreted by the experts of the parties. To detail and compare these interpretations and the arguments in support of them would be a tedious task, and would have to be very extensive to adequately represent their strength. We have estimated them, but consider that general comment rather than specific review is sufficient. The documents undoubtedly have inaccuracies and fault may be found with them, but, allowing for it, they have a direction and concurrent strength which cannot be resisted when combined with other testimony, and demonstrate that the commissioners did not locate the dividing line on the Hangover ridge, but located it along Slick Rock creek to Fodderstack. Their report agrees with such line and the local topography justified its selection. The dividing line as run by them, they reported, began 'a stone set upon the North side of the Catalochee Turnpike road, running thence a southwesterly course to the Bald Rock on the summit of the Great Iron or Smoky Mountain and continuing southwesterly on the extreme height thereof to where it strikes Tennessee River . . . and crossing Tenessee River at the distance of Sixty-five miles from the beginning.' Thus far there is no dispute or uncertainty. 'The summit' of the mountain and its 'extreme height' should determine the locality of the line and the Tennessee river at a distance of 65 miles from the beginning. The next call has no such certain and conspicuous witness. The river is crossed and thence the line runs 'to the main ridge' and then along \n\n[235 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n the 'extreme height' of it. The words of the call suppose an interval between the river and the 'main ridge' whose extreme height thereafter is to be followed,-to be definite, a course up Slick Rock creek to Fodderstack. But, granting that it could be literally satisfied without supposing such an interval, that is, connecting immediately with Hangover ridge, we must resort to the evidence to resolve the conflict of suppositions. We find the first established by the evidence which we have referred to and the marks on the trees. And these marks have of themselves great strength of proof,-irresistible strength when combined with the other testimonies. They are the same in character as those on the undisputed part of the line, made, therefore, to define the continuity of the line, and the report explicitly states that the line was so defined in continuity,-marked 'in its whole length.' We certainly cannot consider that a few trees-two or three only-identified as 'State-line trees,' marked on Hangover ridge, satisfy this statement, or determine that a line along that ridge was the ultimate one selected and the other but tentative, notwithstanding there were found on it from the river to the Fodderstack twenty-seven marked trees, and from the latter point to the junction about as many more. Conjecture against this we cannot indulge. Imagination is not proof, and, we repeat, whatever might be said of any particular piece of evidence standing by itself, their union and concurrence amount to demonstration. And, we repeat, it must have been supposed by the states when they constituted the commission that judgment would have to be exercised, and, when exercised, should be binding. The contention of North Carolina is therefore sustained by the proof as to Slick Rock basin.\n But it is contended by Tennessee that if the commissioners located such line the location was a departure from the cession act and the act of Congress adopting it, and that such line not having received the consent or sanction \n\n[235 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n of Congress is invalid and in conflict with article I.,  10, clause 3 of the Federal Constitution, providing that 'no state shall, without the consent of Congress, . . . enter into any agreement or contract with another state,' etc. If the fact of such departure could be conceded the conclusion might be disputed. Virginia v. Tennessee, \n148 U.S. 503\n, 37 L. ed. 537, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 728. But the fact cannot be conceded. The cession act is very general and necessarily demanded definition to satisfy the requirements of a boundary line,-a line not only necessary to mark private property, but political jurisdiction. This was realized and commissioners were appointed to run and settle the line exactly. Their work as executed was confirmed by the states.\n The considerations which determine decision upon the contentions of the states as to the Slick Rock basin apply to the Tellico territory. Indeed, they make more strongly against the Tennessee contention. Without the newly discovered evidence the judicial judgment was adverse to that contention. Stevenson v. Fain, 53 C. C. A. 467, 116 Fed. 147. The judgment is fortified by the evidence in this case. The comments of the court in that case and the considerations which have been expressed in this are sufficient to disclose the grounds of deciding that North Carolina is also right in its contention as to the Tellico territory and in the relief sought by its bill.\n A decree should be entered adjudging that the disputed part of the boundary line between the states of North Carolina and Tennessee which was run by the commissioners appointed by the respective states in 1821, and who made report thereof dated at Knoxville, Tennessee, August 31, 1821, descends from the extreme height of the mountain northeast of the Tennessee river, crosses the river at a distance of 65 miles from the beginning to a point on the southwest bank thereof just west of the mouth of the stream known as Slick Rock creek, follows the creek a short distance to a ridge leading up \n\n[235 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n to the main ridge, follows said ridge up to the summit known as Big Fodderstack mountain, and follows the main ridge thence to the junction of the Big Fodderstack and Hangover leads, and thence follows the main ridge of the Unaka mountain southwesterly, according to the plat exhibited with this opinion. And, further, that commissioners be appointed to permanently mark said line.\n The cross bill of the state of Tennessee should be dismissed.\n Counsel for the respective states are given forty days from the entry hereof to agree upon three commissioners and to present to the court for its approval a decree drawn according to the directions herein given, in default of which agreement and decree this court will appoint commissioners, and itself draw the decree in conformity herewith. Costs to be equally divided between the states.\n Mr. Justice Day took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","212":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF WISCONSIN EX REL. BOLENS v. FREAR(1914)\nNo. 447\nArgued: Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[231 U.S. 616, 617]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Paul D. Carpenter for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. E. C. Brandenburg in behalf of Messers Walter C. Owen, George G. Greene, and J. E. Dodge for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The attorney general of the state of Wisconsin, by direction of the governor of the state, moves to dismiss on the ground that the state is the real party in interest, because Bolens, the relator, personally, was in the court below the mere agent of the state, devoid of all authority to prosecute this writ of error and thereby to implead the state in this court without its consent. Indeed, the motion to dismiss in a strict sense is a motion to quash the writ of error on the ground that no writ was ever sued out, and that in effect there is no judgment below to which the writ could be directed, since the state, who was the party plaintiff, and the officers of the state, who were the defendants, both acquiesced in and have executed the judgment.\n The decree to which the writ of error is directed was rendered on a demurrer to the petition filed in the supreme court of Wisconsin by Bolens, as relator, asking the court as a matter of original cognizance to enjoin the putting in force of a state law creating a new system of state taxation described as 'progressive income taxation.' 148 Wis. 456, 134 N. W. 673, 135 N. W. 164, Ann. Cas. 1913 A, 1147. We accept a statement contained in the argument of the plaintiff in error concerning the nature of the original jurisdiction of the court below:\n'The Constitution of the state of Wisconsin confers original jurisdiction upon the supreme court of the state to issue writs of injunction and other original and remedial writs, and to hear and determine the same. Art. 7, \n\n[231 U.S. 616, 618]\n\u00a0\n  3. This clause gives full jurisdiction to the state supreme court over any question quod ad statum reipublicae pertinet, affecting the 'sovereignty of the state, its franchises or prerogatives, or the liberties of the people.' Such action is to be brought originally in the state supreme court, and may be instituted by the attorney general, acting on his own initiative, or acting on the petition of a citizen; or, if he refuses to act on the petition of a citizen, then the citizen may, on notice, apply to the supreme court for permission to bring the action for the state in the name of the attorney general, and the court may refuse or grant such permission.'\n\n Further, we adopt a statement in the argument for the plaintiff in error as to the grievances which it was deemed required judicial redress and the steps taken which were exacted by the state statute as prerequisite to obtain an exertion by the court of its original jurisdiction:\n'Harry W. Bolens presented his petition to the then attorney general of Wisconsin, setting up that the Wisconsin income tax law, chapter 658 of the Laws of Wisconsin for 1911, is wholly null, void, and of none effect, for that it violates numerous sections of both state and Federal Constitutions, most of these objections being set out in detail, followed by an omnibus allegation; and praying that for the wrongs complained of and for the protection of himself and all others similarly situated, and for the protection of all the taxpayers of the state against the threatened invasion of their rights and liberties, and forasmuch as all said persons are remediless in the premises without the interposition of the state supreme court, that the attorney general move the court for leave to bring the action designed 'so as fully to protect and secure the said rights and privileges guaranteed to the people of this state by the Constitution of the United States and the Amendments thereto, and the Constitution of the state of Wisconsin and the amendments thereto.\" \n\n[231 U.S. 616, 619]\n\u00a0\n The attorney general, refusing to comply with the request, the supreme court, on motion of the relator, ordered the petition to be filed without prejudice to thereafter considering whether there was jurisdiction to entertain it. Subsequently the court overruled a demurrer challenging its original jurisdiction, and moreover held on a demurrer addressed to the merits that the petition stated no ground for the relief which was prayed. The court, in so doing, defined the nature of the power possessed by it as a matter of original jurisdiction to hear and determine the case made by the petition.\n\n It said:\n'This transcendent jurisdiction is a jurisdiction reserved for the use of the state itself when it appears to be necessary to vindicate or protect its prerogatives or franchises or the liberties of its people. The state uses it to punish or prevent wrongs to itself or to the whole people. The state is always the plaintiff, and the only plaintiff, whether the action be brought by the attorney general, or against his consent, on the relation of a private individual, under the permission and direction of the court. It is never the private relator's suit. He is a mere incident. He brings the public injury to the attention of the court, and the court, by virtue of the power granted by the Constitution, commands that the suit be brought by and for the state. The private relator may have a private interest which may be extinguished (if it be severable from the public interest), yet still the state's action proceeds to vindicate the public right.' Contrasting the authority thus possessed by virtue of its original jurisdiction with the ordinary processes for the redress of private wrongs, the court said: 'These propositions, if correct, and we believe they are, demonstrate very clearly that there can be no such thing as a taxpayer's action (as that action is known in the circuit courts) brought in the supreme court within the original jurisdiction.' \n\n[231 U.S. 616, 620]\n\u00a0\n Referring to such a taxpayer's suit, the court observed:\n\n'The taxpayer himself is the actual party to the litigation, and represents not the whole public, nor the state, nor even all the inhabitants of his municipality, but a comparatively limited class; namely, the citizens who pay taxes. In short, he sues for a class. No such thing is known in the exercise of the original jurisdiction of this court. In actions brought within that jurisdiction, the state is the plaintiff, and sues to vindicate the rights of the whole people.'\n\n Applying these doctrines, it was said:\n'The Bolens Case [this case] cannot, therefore, be held to come within the original jurisdiction of this court, if it be a mere taxpayer's action.'\n\n After further pointing out the distinction between the right of an individual to sue in a trial court to enforce an individual right or redress a wrong, and, if aggrieved, to prosecute error or appeal, and the difference between the exertion on such error or appeal of authority to review, and the extraordinary power exerted when original jurisdiction was invoked, the court came to consider the merits of the petition. In doing so it declared that because of the public nature of the controversy, it would confine attention solely to those matters which were addressed to the invalidity of the statute as a whole. In passing upon questions of that character, propositions which asserted the statute to be repugnant to both the United States and state Constitutions were analyzed and held to be without merit. The petition was dismissed.\n From this statement it is apparent that the motion of the state to dismiss is well-founded for the following reasons: (a) Because accepting the interpretation affixed by the court below to the state Constitution, and the resulting ruling as to the scope of its own original jurisdiction, it follows that the state was the only real plaintiff below, \n\n[231 U.S. 616, 621]\n\u00a0\n since the relator had no authority to sue but by the consent of the state, and as its mere agent for the purpose of calling into activity judicial authority, not for the redress of individual wrong, but for the protection of general public rights; (a) because the suit, having been brought by the consent of the state, in its behalf, the relator had no power, without the consent of the state, to prosecute error, and thus to implead the state without its consent; (c) because, as the relator did not resort to the methods provided by law for the enforcement of his individual rights, if any, but elected solely to resort, by the consent of the state, to a jurisdiction given only for the redress of general public wrongs, he may not, by means of a writ of error, directed from this court, transform the nature of the proceedings, and secure at the hands of this court, under the guise of an appellate proceeding, the exertion of authority to originally determine alleged grievances which were not passed upon by the court below and are not within the scope of Rev. Stat.  709, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 575. The argument that if, asserting his individual grievances, the case had been brought in a trial court, and had been carried to the supreme court of the state from an adverse decision upon a Federal question, the judgment or decree of the supreme court would be here reviewable, hence the decision in this case, to save circuity of action, should be now reviewable, amounts but to saying that because there is authority to decide a legal question in a case where there is jurisdiction, there must also be power to pass upon the same question when it arises in a case over which there is no jurisdiction. Under the ruling below no individual right of the relator was denied, and because it may be inferred that if, in the future, a case asserting individual rights in due course of procedure comes to the court below, that court will be controlled or persuaded by the opinions expressed in this case, furnishes no ground for the exertion by this court in the \n\n[231 U.S. 616, 622]\n\u00a0\n present case of a jurisdiction which it does not possess. Indeed, whether the case be considered in the light of the absence of any assertion of individual right or grievance on behalf of the relator, or be looked at from the point of view that the suit was one under the state law which could only be brought by the permission of the state and for the protection of its governmental authority, the state being therefore the real party plaintiff, or if it be tested by the want of authority on the part of the relator by means of a writ of error to implead the state under the circumstances disclosed without its consent in this court, the want of jurisdiction is so conclusively shown by previous decisions as to leave no room for controversy (Smith v. Reeves, \n178 U.S. 436\n, 44 L. ed. 1140, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 919.)\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","213":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTEWART v.

Laws 1897,  5324.]\n\n Violation of the statute was made a misdemeanor punishable by fine or imprisonment.\n Briefly stated, the material facts, which are uncontro- \n\n[232 U.S. 665, 668]\n\u00a0\n verted, are as follows: The defendant resided in the city of Chicago, where he was engaged in the general merchandise business, but much of his time was spent in the state of Michigan, soliciting orders for groceries and other merchandise to be shipped from his Chicago store. Duplicates of the orders secured were mailed by him to his manager in Chicago, and goods corresponding to the orders were shipped in carload lots from the Chicago store, consigned to the defendant at St. Joseph and other points in Berrien county, Michigan. Upon the arrival of the cars at St. Joseph the goods were delivered to the customers by draymen employed by the defendant, who filled the orders at the car by checking from the original orders, there being no identifying marks on the packages, except as to their contents. Customers living at a distance received notice by mail of the arrival of the cars, and called or sent for their goods. If for any reason any orders were undelivered, the goods corresponding to such orders were returned to the Chicago store, or placed in a storeroom which the defendant hired in Benton Harbor, Michigan, and there is some evidence tending to show that occasional sales were made by the defendant from the storeroom and from the car without previous solicitation.\n Upon the above facts the trial court charged the jury as follows:\n'In this case it is claimed by the defendant that he was engaged in interstate commerce, and that he was protected by the interstate commerce law.\n\n'Now, it is true that a wholesale merchant or grocer, in the city of Chicago, for instance, can solicit orders through an agent in this state, and he can send an agent here to deliver the goods.\n\n'The facts, however, in this case, are different. The goods were shipped here in a car consigned to the defendant himself. The goods were never consigned to the man who made the order, and when they got here they were \n\n[232 U.S. 665, 669]\n\u00a0\n not the goods of the man who made the order, because if any of those men who had made an order had gone down to the car, they could not have claimed the goods that were there because they could not be identified. The packages were mixed promiscuously in boxes, and there were no names on the packages. Moreover, those goods were not shipped according to the usual course of business, promptly, but there was a delay of some two or three months in the shipment of those goods.\n\n'I hold, gentlemen, that there was no sale ever consummated until the goods were actually delivered by the drayman at the house. Ordinarily the sale is consummated at Chicago (where goods are ordered from Chicago), and the sale is consummated the moment they are shipped at the city of Chicago, directed to the consignee. In this case no sale was consummated whatever until the goods were actually delivered at the house.\n\n'So I hold, practically, that the car was a mere warehouse or place of doing business by the defendant, and it was there that he distributed the goods as he pleased. For that reason, gentlemen, I hold that the defendant comes within the law, and that he is what is called a hawker and peddler.\n\n ... * *\n'In this case, as it is only a matter of law, and there are no facts in dispute, it will be your duty of course, as a matter of form, to follow the direction of the court. I find, gentlemen of the jury, in this case, that the defendant, under the evidence and the law, is guilty of the charge. . . .'\n\n And the correctness of the charge thus given was in terms sustained by the supreme court of the state in its opinion.\n The charge as thus given and affirmed is clearly in conflict with the rule announced in Crenshaw v. Arkansas, \n227 U.S. 389\n, 57 L. ed. 565, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 294, and the cases there reviewed. Indeed, \n\n[232 U.S. 665, 670]\n\u00a0\n reference to authority is unnecessary, since it was admitted in the argument at bar that the judgment below, in so far as it affirmed the action of the trial court in holding that there could be a conviction because of the deliveries of merchandise from the cars to fill orders previously solicited and obtained, was erroneous because in conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution. But it is said although there was manifestly reversible error from this point of view, nevertheless, as from another point of view there was a ground adequate to sustain the judgment, there should be an affirmance. The court below, it is said, not only placed its affirmance upon the erroneous ruling as to the sales made under orders, but also upon the ground that there was evidence showing some sales made from the car or storeroom not under previous orders, and as the latter sales were not within the shelter of the commerce clause, therefore the affirmance on that ground was an independent non-Federal conclusion sustaining the action of the court and calling for the duty of affirmance. But this proposition disregards the fact that the only charge made against the accused was for peddling, and that the instructions of the court and the whole course of the trial conclusively established that the sales made from the car, as the result of the orders solicited, formed the sole basis for the prosecution, and the conviction therefore related to that, and to that alone. If, then, it be admitted that the judgment below was placed upon two grounds, such admission would not establish that the judgment rested upon an independent state ground adequate to sustain it, since the first ground, it is admitted, was Federal and erroneous, and the second ground, if upheld, would amount to a condemnation without hearing, and therefore constitute a denial of due process of law. Thus the proposition, if sustained, would require us to hold that an admitted violation of one constitutional right must be left uncorrected because at the same time another and equally \n\n[232 U.S. 665, 671]\n\u00a0\n fundamental constitutional right was disregarded; a conclusion which would give effect to both wrongs obviously demonstrates our plain duty to reverse and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","214":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTONE, SAND & GRAVEL CO. v. U. S.(1914)\nNo. 302\nArgued: April 23, 1914Decided: June 8, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. William Marshall Bullitt, Henry C. Willcox, and T. M. Miller for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[234 U.S. 270, 273]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Davis and Mr. Francis H. McAdoo for the defendant in error.\n\n\n[234 U.S. 270, 274]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lurton delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an action by the United States against the Stone, Sand, & Gravel Company, a corporation, hereinafter styled the contractor, and its surety, the American Surety Company of New York, to recover the excess cost of completion of a certain contract for excavating 7,500,000 cubic yards of earth within certain designated localities in the work of improving the harbor of Vicksburg, Mississippi. For this work the United States agreed to pay 8.49 cents per cubic yard as the work progressed, and the contractor agreed to begin active work on or before December 5, 1899, with sufficient force and plant for an output of not less than 260,000 cubic yards per month, to be increased on or before January 5, 1900, to a plant adequate for an output of 330,000 cubic yards per month. Subsequently, upon application of the contractor, the time for beginning was extended to January 24, 1900. While by \n\n[234 U.S. 270, 275]\n\u00a0\n January 24th the contractor had made large expenditures in preparing to commence work, it had not on that day assembled the necessary force or plant. For this reason the Chief of Engineers on the following day confirmed a prior, anticipatory recommendation of the engineer in charge that the contract should be annulled. An application for an extension of time was denied by the Secretary of War, and on March 7, 1900, formal notice was given to the contractor, as required by the contract, that it had failed to prosecute the work of excavation, etc., 'in accordance with specifications and requirements . . . and the said contract is hereby annulled.' The work was relet at a price of 12.4 cents per cubic yard, making an excess cost of $228,201.91, and an action was brought and judgment had against the contractor for that sum, minus a credit of $6,206. 69, on account of certain voluntary work of an experimental character, which sum had been retained by the United States. There was also judgment against the surety company for $75,000, the full penalty of the bond.\n The only breach of contract alleged was the failure to begin active operations on the day stipulated with a plant and force adequate to produce the monthly output required. The breach is confessed, but the error insisted upon here is that the contract, for such a breach, limits the measure of recovery to liquidated damages; namely, a forfeiture of all money or retained percentages due or to become due under the contract, and that the court below erred in allowing as damages the excess cost of the work under the reletting.\n The clauses of the contract which give rise to this contention occur in the standard form of contract used by the War Department, known as form 19, and are the same clauses construed by this court in United States v. O'Brien, \n220 U.S. 321\n, 55 L. ed. 481, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 406. The clauses involved for purposes of reference may be described as clauses A and B. In clause A \n\n[234 U.S. 270, 276]\n\u00a0\n it is expressly provided that if the contractor 'fail to commence with the performance of the work on the day specified herein, or shall, in the judgment of the engineer in charge, fail to prosecute faithfully and diligently the work in accordance with the specifications and requirements of this contract, then, in either case . . . the engineer in charge shall have power, with the sanction of the Chief of Engineers, to annul this contract by giving notice in writing to that effect . . . and upon the giving of such notice all money or reserved percentage due or to become due . . . by reason of this contract shall be and become forfeited to the United States. . . .' The engineer in charge is thereupon authorized, if an immediate performance of the work 'be, in his opinion, required by the public exigency, to proceed to provide for the same . . .' as prescribed in  3709, Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2484).\n Following clause A are three other clauses dealing with changes in the work, cost of extra work, and liabilities for labor and material furnished. Then comes B, which reads as follows:\n'It is further understood and agreed that in case of failure on the part of the party of the second part to complete this contract as specified and agreed upon, that all sums due and percentages retained shall thereby be forfeited to the United States, and that the said United States shall also have the right to recover any or all damages due to such failure in excess of the sums so forfeited, and also to recover from the party of the second part, as part of said damages, whatever sums may be expended by the party of the first part in completing the said contract, in excess of the price herein stipulated to be paid to the party of the second part for completing the same.'\n\n That there was no abandonment of the contract by the plaintiffs in error is too plain to need discussion. Large expenditures were made to get ready, and further exten- \n\n[234 U.S. 270, 277]\n\u00a0\n sions of time were sought both before and after notice of annulment. The explanation of the failure to get ready lies in the obvious fact that the contract was larger than the financial capacity of the contractor, and the United States was plainly within its contract right in putting it off the job and in reletting the work.\n What is the measure of recovery against the contractor where the government 'annuls' the contract for failure to commence the work upon a stipulated day? The right to 'annul,' that is, to prohibit the contractor from going on under the contract, is plainly conferred in two distinct cases by clause A,-first, when the contractor fails to begin upon the day stipulated, and, second, when, having commenced the work, the contractor fails, 'in the judgment of the engineer in charge, to prosecute the work faithfully and diligently.' In either case the same section specifically declares that upon the giving of the notice of annulment, 'all money or reserved percentages due or to become due to the contractor . . . shall be and become forfeited to the United States.'\n It is therefore obvious that if the right to annul this contract depends upon clause A, the measure of damages recoverable in this action is limited by that clause to the forfeiture of all moneys or retained percentages due or to become due under the contract. United States v. O'Brien, supra. This is plainly conceded in the brief of the Solicitor General.\n To escape confession of error in the judgment below, in so far as the United States was permitted to recover the excess cost of reletting the job, it has been argued that the right to annul the contract did not arise out of clause A, but was 'a right inherent' in this and every other contract when time is of the essence, and that when there was, as in this case, a breach of an express agreement to begin the work upon a certain day, the right to annul was complete; and upon annulment the right to recover all actual damages followed. Of course, this so-called 'inherent right' to annul a contract, with the consequent right to \n\n[234 U.S. 270, 278]\n\u00a0\n recover all actual damages as for a complete breach, are rights supposed to arise not out of any express agreement, but out of the common law. But the assumption that, aside from clause A, an agreement to begin such a work on a particular day would be such a vital term of the contract as to justify the other party in an immediate annulment if the work was not so begun is seriously challenged. The vital character of time to the contract would depend upon its nature and particular circumstances. These might be such that time would not be of the essence of the contract at all. Any resort to the contract here involved as making time the essence of the agreement must include clause A, which expressly determines the consequences. Such an appeal to the contract would naturally result detrimentally to the argument here made, since the contract, while making time vital, provides also for the consequence of a breach in that respect. The benefit and the burden of clause A must hang together.\n But we need not deal with the consequences as if clause A had been omitted. The right might have been inherent, or not so vital as to justify the rigor of annulment. Both parties elected to deal with the matter by express stipulation, and that should be and is the end of it. In such a situation there would be no justice in straining the contract for a construction which would limit its application to cases where the right of annulment would not exist without it. This contract was prepared in advance of the bidding by the United States. The bidder was required to bid with strict reference to its terms. One term was that the work should begin with a plant and force of definite capacity on or before a particular day. Another was that if this term was not complied with the United States might annul the contract, and that, as a consequence \n\n[234 U.S. 270, 279]\n\u00a0\n of such annulment, all money earned under it should be forfeited. This forfeiture is not made dependent upon the existence of any actual damage. Thus, damages were, by stipulation, liquidated. That such damages may be in this instance inadequate may be true, but the fact affords no ground for frittering away the agreement by fanciful distinctions which never entered the head of either party to it.\n The plain purpose was to obtain for the United States the right to take the contract from a bidder who should break his agreement at its threshhold and let the work to another, possibly for a better price. At any rate, the right to annul for a breach in respect of the time of beginning was a valuable right, and for it the government stipulated and liquidated the damages in the event of its exercise. The contractor would not only lose his contract, but also would forfeit everything due him. The agreement settled the right and all the consequences of its exercise.\n There is nothing in the case of United States v. O'Brien, supra, which would justify the limitation that the United States would now have us place upon this plain provision of the contract. The contract in that case was a dredging contract. The work was to begin on a day named and be completed on another. The contract was according to form 19, and included the two clauses, A and B, above set out. The work was begun on time. The first member of clause A was therefore eliminated from any consideration. The dredging did not progress to the satisfaction of the engineer in charge, who elected to stop the contractor from going on, when, confessedly, time enough remained to complete the work within contract time. The United States, under these circumstances, sought to recover the excess cost of completing the work, but this court held that such excess cost could only be recovered under clause B for failure to complete according to the terms of the agreement. There had been no breach of the agreement, \n\n[234 U.S. 270, 280]\n\u00a0\n as time remained to finish the work had the contractor not been prohibited from going on because the engineer in charge was not satisfied with the progress of the job. But the right to annul for the later reason was a right conferred by clause A, with the damages limited as therein provided. The United States was precluded from the rule of damages prescribed by clause B, and, being forced to justify under clause A, was held bound by the limitation of that clause.\n The right to annul is expressly conferred by clause A for a failure to begin on the stipulated day. The United States resorted to that clause for its authority, and pursued the procedure therein pointed out. It is plainly bound by the limitation of damages therein prescribed. For the error in not so confining the recovery, the judgment is reversed and a new trial awarded. \n\n\n\n","215":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSWIFT v. MCPHERSON(1914)\nNo. 77\nArgued: November 14, 1913Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n McPherson, as assignee of Miller, brought suit against Swift in a circuit court of South Dakota, seeking to eatablish his rights to an undivided one-half interest in certain land then in the possession of Swift. The defendant denied that McPherson had any interest in the property. He further claimed that McPherson had once before brought a similar suit which, after being removed to the circuit court of the United States, had been dismissed, and that this dismissal finally adjudicated the matters at issue in favor of Swift and against McPherson. The record in the former suit was set out in the answer; and as the pleadings in the two cases both deal with the same matters, it will conduce to brevity to state the facts in narrative form. \n\n[232 U.S. 51, 52]\n\u00a0\n Swift, on May 8, 1888, purchased a tract of land in Deadwood, South Dakota, paying therefor $18,500, and taking the deed in his own name. Miller, who was a resident of Deadwood, had been active in securing the land, and, on May 14, 1888, Swift and he made a contract which recited that Miller 'had purchased the land for Swift and for joint account.' For his services in collecting the rents and looking after the property, Miller was to receive one half of the net profits, first deducting 8 per cent interest on the purchase price of $18,500. 'In consideration of Miller's agreement to pay Swift one half of any ultimate loss that might accrue on said purchase, Swift agreed that Miller should receive one half of the profits ultimately accruing from the sale of the property over and above the purchase price,'-$18,500.\n Miller died January 12, 1891, and his administrator obtained an order for the sale of Miller's interest in the land described in the agreement with Swift. After advertisement, this interest was sold to McPherson for $ 5,005. Thereupon, on May 18, 1893, McPherson filed in the state court a bill against Swift, which was removed to the United States circuit court. In it McPherson set out his purchase of Miller's interest, and alleged that at all times since Miller's death, the land could have been sold for a sum largely in excess of $18,500, but that Swift had neglected to sell or to account for the rents and profits. McPherson, in the bill, tendered Swift $9,250, one-half of the original purchase price, and demanded a conveyance and an accounting. Swift's demurrer having been overruled, he answers, alleging, among other things, that the original contract had been fraudulently procured by Miller, but claiming that, if originally valid, it was a mere contract of employment which had been revoked by the death of Miller, and which therefore could not pass to McPherson under the administrator's sale.\n A replication was filed. Several terms passed without \n\n[232 U.S. 51, 53]\n\u00a0\n any testimony having been taken, and Swift finally notified McPherson that he would accept the tender of $9,250, and recognized him as a partner and joint owner on the terms stated in the bill. McPherson made no reply to this offer, and thereupon Swift filed a petition in the cause, reciting McPherson's refusal to pay the $9,250 tendered in the bill, renewed his offer to accept the tender, and asked leave to withdraw from his answer those paragraphs which set up an affirmative defense, and 'to submit to a decree in plaintiff's favor on such terms as might by the court be found equitable and just.'\n A copy of this petition was served on McPherson, who was required to show cause why it should not be granted.\n At the February term (1896) McPherson appeared in person and by his solicitors, filed a response under oath, in which he moved the court to dismiss his bill of complaint, stating that his tender had been made at a time when the value of the property was such that it could have been sold at a price to net a profit; that Swift had declined to accept the tender, and the property was now much depreciated in value; and that the tender had been withdrawn before the procurement of the order to show cause. McPherson's response concluded by the statement that 'the contract does not require this affiant to pay any part of the purchase money for the property, but the same is to be paid at affiant's option out of the proceeds of the sale; and while he was willing to have paid the $9,250 at the time the tender was made, the defendant's refusal for an unreasonable time, and the depreciation of the value was so great that affiant is not willing now to exceed the strict letter of the contract in reference to the mode and manner of reimbursing the defendant for the original purchase price, wherefore he prays the court to discharge the order to show cause, and to dismiss the complaint herein as prayed for in this motion.'\n After argument by counsel, the court made an order re- \n\n[232 U.S. 51, 54]\n\u00a0\n citing that 'the cause coming on to be heard on the application of Swift for leave to withdraw pars. 13 and 14 of his answer, and to submit to a decree in plaintiff's favor on such terms as might be equitable . . . and the resisting affidavit of the plaintiff, who, at the same time, by his solicitors, moved to dismiss the bill . . . and the court having heard the matter upon the affidavit, bill of complaint, verified answer, and replication, it is ordered that Swift's application be denied, and it is further adjudged and decreed that this suit and bill of complaint . . . be and the same is hereby dismissed, and that defendant have and recover of plaintiff, McPherson, the costs of this suit.' The defendant excepted, but there is no record of any appeal having been taken by Swift.\n In June, 1901, five years later, McPherson brought the present suit in the state court, alleging that Swift had collected large sums by way of rent on the land and the sale of lots, which sums were more than sufficient to reimburse Swift for the purchase price of $18,500, interest and expenses, and that upon an accounting, McPherson would be entitled to one half of these net profits and to an undivided one half of the lots remaining unsold. McPherson prayed for such relief and for partition.\n The defendant answered, attacking the validity of the contract. He also set out the proceedings in the former suit, and pleaded that decree of dismissal by the United States circuit court as a bar to the present suit.\n The trial resulted in Swift's favor, but the decree was reversed by the supreme court of the state. 22 S. D. 179, 133 Am. St. Rep. 907, 116 N. W. 76. On the second trial the court found that there had been no fraud on Miller's part; that the contract was not one of employment, but created an interest in the property which was assignable; that McPherson was the owner thereof by virtue of the administrator's sale; that Swift had received $103,436 from rental and sale of land, and \n\n[232 U.S. 51, 55]\n\u00a0\n that after proper deductions there was a net profit of $22,374. A decree was thereupon entered in favor of McPherson for $11,187, and also for an undivided one half of over 100 city lots remaining unsold. On appeal the decree was affirmed (27 S. D. 296, 130 N. W. 768), and the case was then brought here by writ of error.\n Messrs. Edwin Van Cise, William H. Beck, Frank L. Grant, and Philip S. Van Cise for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Norman T. Mason, Chambers Kellar, Kellar, and James G. Stanley for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Lamar:\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n In the recore there are sixty assignments of error, involving many rulings of the trial court and the construction of the contract. We can only consider those which present the Federal question that, in failing to sustain the plea of res judicata, the court denied plaintiff a right arising under the laws of the United States. The refusal of the state court to treat the decree of the United States court as a bar to the present action is said to have impaired the obligation of that decree as a contract; denied the full faith and credit to which it was entitled, and deprived Swift of it as property without due process of law. But all these contentions finally resolve themselves into the single question as to whether the dismissal was on the merits, finally adjudicating that McPherson had no enforceable rights under the contract which was the basis of that suit.\n Ordinarily, such a question is answered by a mere inspection of the decree,-the presumption being that a \n\n[232 U.S. 51, 56]\n\u00a0\n dismissal in equity, without qualifying words, is a final decision on the merits. That presumption of finality, however, disappears whenever the record shows that the court did not pass upon the merits, but dismissed the bill because of a want of jurisdiction, for want of parties, because the suit was brought prematurely, because the plaintiff had a right to file a subsequent bill on the same subject-matter, or on any other ground not going to the merits. The scope of such decree must in all cases be measured not only by the allegations of the bill, but by the ground of the demurrer or motion on which the dismissal was based. Hughes v. United States, 4 Wall. 237, 18 L. ed. 305; Vicksburg v. Henson, \n231 U.S. 259\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 95.\n From an examination of this record it is evident that the dismissal by the United States court was not for want of merit in the bill, because the demurrer had already been overruled. It was not for insufficiency of the testimony, because none had been taken though answer and replication had been filed. It was not a dismissal after a hearing on bill and answer alone, for the defendant was asking to withdraw his affirmative defense, and insisting that a decree be entered in favor of McPherson. It was not a dismissal as on a retraxit, for the plaintiff not only did not renounce his cause of action, but, in his motion asserted his rights under a contract which provided for a future adjustment, of profits and liabilities, whenever the amount of profits or losses was ultimately determined by the actual sale of the land.\n McPherson seems, at first, to have assumed that it was not necessary to wait until the property had been sold, but that by a then present payment of $9,250, he could at once acquire title to an undivided half interest in the lots. His tender of that sum was, however, declined by Swift, who, a year or more later, finally decided to accept the money, and asked that a decree be entered in McPherson's favor. McPherson then refused to pay what \n\n[232 U.S. 51, 57]\n\u00a0\n he had previously offered, explaining in his response to Swift's motion, that since the rejection of the tender the land had decreased in value, and asserting that he was not then willing to do more than was required by the contract,-under which he could wait until the ultimate sale of the property to determine what, if anything, he was bound to pay. He thereupon 'moved the court to dismiss the bill, as prayed for in this motion.' The motion was granted, and Swift excepted.\n The record presented an unusual and somewhat ludicrous shifting of positions,-with the defendant insisting that a decree be entered against himself; the complainant resisting a decree in his favor; and the defendant, with no cross bill filed, excepting to a dismissal. Of course, this reversal of position does not change the legal effect of the decree, but it serves to emphasize the fact that it was not a decree against plaintiff on the merits, but one based on McPherson's motion which asserted a contract fixing liability and giving him rights dependent on the ultimate outcome of the investment. The court did not decide what those rights were, nor did it adjudicate that a suit to enforce them could not thereafter be filed. The decree, not being on the merits, could not be a bar to such subsequent suit in a state or United States court (Texas as Cotton Products Co. v. Starnes, 128 Fed. 183). The refusal to treat the decree as conclusive of a point which had been left open did not deprive Swift of any Federal right, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of South Dakota must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","216":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTANEY v. PENN NAT BANK OF READING(1914)\nNo. 115\nArgued: Decided: January 26, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 174, 175]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joseph Hill Brinton for appellant.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 174, 178]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. Leo Weil, Lawrence Maxwell Philip S. Zieber, and Thomas Iaeger Snyder for appellee. \n\n[232 U.S. 174, 179]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n On February 3, 1908, a petition in bankruptcy was filed against the Miller Pure Rye Distilling Company; it was adjudicated a bankrupt on February 19, 1908, and the appellant was appointed trustee. The Penn National Bank of Reading, Pennsylvania, the appellee, intervened in the bankruptcy proceeding with a petition asking for the delivery to it of 200 barrels of whisky stored in the bonded warehouse of the distilling company, upon the ground that the property had been lawfully pledged by the company to the bank. The district court sustained the lien and accordingly held the claimant entitled to the delivery sought (176 Fed. 606); and, on appeal, this decree was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals (109 C. C. A. 437, 187 Fed. 689).\n The pertinent facts are these: On August 27, 1907, the bank lent to the distilling company $2,500, for which the company gave its four months' note, reciting the deposit with the bank, as collateral security, of '200 bbls. whisky in bonded warehouse at Womelsdorf, Pa., as per Warehouse Rects. gauger's ctf. etc. accompanying.' The form of the receipts is shown by the following copy of one of them:\n No. 5454. 25 Bbls.\n First District of Pennsylvania.\n United States Internal Revenue Distillery Bonded Warehouse of Miller Pure Rye Distilling Company.\n Ryeland, Berks Co., Pa., August 26th, 1907\n\n\n Received on Storage from Ourselves Twenty-five (25) Barrels of Miller Pure Rye Whiskey Distilled, Marked and Numbered as per Record Attached, Subject to our Order and Risk of Loss or Damage by Fire, The Elements, Leakage, Evaporation or Accident, Deliverable only upon Surrender of this Certificate, Payment of Tax and other \n\n[232 U.S. 174, 180]\n\u00a0\n Charges due Thereon, and Storage at the Rate of Five Cents per Barrel per month, from August 26th, 1907.\n Inspection Spring 1907.\n Stored in Warehouse No. 2.\n Serial Nos. of Packages 7964\/7988.\n Miller Pure Rye Distilling Co.,\n S. V. Nagle, President.\n Address all Communications to Miller Pure Rye Distilling Company, Philadelphia, Pa.\n Special Notice-Particular care should be taken of this Certificate as the whisky cannot be delivered without its surrender.\n These receipts were indorsed by the company, and, with the gauger's certificates, were delivered to the bank. The whisky itself was not actually delivered, and remained in the bonded warehouse. The note not being paid at maturity, the bank, upon notice, sold the warehouse receipts at public sale on February 5, 1908, and became the purchaser. This sale, however, is not material to the present question, which turns upon the validity of the lien.\n There is no doubt as to the intention and actual good faith of the parties. The loan was made in reliance upon the designated security, and the ground of attack is that the lien failed for want of delivery of possession.\n The legal effect of the transaction depends upon the local law.

Reviewing the decisions of the supreme court of Pennsulvania with respect to sales,- the principles of which were deemed to be applicable,-the circuit court of appeals reached the following conclusion: 'It suffices to say that the law of \n\n[232 U.S. 174, 181]\n\u00a0\n Pennsylvania, in respect of the question we are now considering, is settled by a line of cases extending through nearly a century. Starting with the policy of the statute of Elizabeth, for the circumvention of fraud and deceit in sales of personal property (which nowhere in terms refers to retention of possession by a vendor, it has wisely developed the spirit of that statute and evolved the salutary rule, that where there is nothing in the case but the retention of a physical possession by the vendor, which he is capable of delivering to the vendee, such retention is fraud per se, and not merely evidence of fraud, even though there be nothing inconsistent with the most perfect honesty. But this rule is not applied by the courts of Pennsylvania to cases where the inherent nature of the transaction and the attendant circumstances are such as to preclude the possibility of a delivery by the vendor, that would be consistent with the avowed and fair purpose of the sale, or where the absence of a physical delivery is excused by the usages of the trade or business in which the sale was made.' 109 C. C. A. 437, 444, 187 Fed. 689, 696.\n We entertain no doubt as to the correctness of this statement (Clow v. Woods, 5 Serg. & R. 277, 9 Am. Dec. 346; Barr v. Reitz, 53 Pa. 256; McKibbin v. Martin, 64 Pa. 352, 3 Am. Rep. 588; Crawford v. Davis, 99 Pa. 576; Stephens v. Gifford, 137 Pa. 219, 21 Am. St. Rep. 286, 20 Atl. 542; Pressel v. Bice, 142 Pa. 263, 21 Atl. 813; Garretson v.

Gunn, 205 Pa. 229, 54 Atl. 901), and it was in the light of these principles that the court below held that, considering the situation of the property and the usages of the business, the transaction in question was valid.\n To insure collection of the heavy tax that is laid upon distilled spirits, the production is carefully supervised and the product is impounded. Rev. Stat.  3247-3334, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2107-2183, as amended; act of May 28, 1880, chap. 108, 21 Stat. at L. 145; act of August 27, 1894, chap. 349,  48-67, 28 Stat. at. L. 509, 563-568, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2109, 2141-2146, 2102, 2052, 2166, 2117. Every dis- \n\n[232 U.S. 174, 182]\n\u00a0\n tiller is required to provide, at his own expense, 'a warehouse, to be situated on and to constitute a part of his distillery premises, and to be used only for the storage of distilled spirits of his own manufacture until the tax thereon shall have been paid.' This warehouse, when approved, by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, is declared by the statute to be 'a bonded warehouse of the United States, to be known as a distillery warehouse,' and is 'under the direction and control of the collector of the district, and in charge of an internal-revenue storekeeper, assigned thereto by the Commissioner' ( 3271). While the statute provides that 'every distillery warehouse shall be in the joint custody of the storekeeper and the proprietor thereof,' the control of the government's representative is made dominant, as in the nature of the case it must be in order to fulfil the purposes of the act. The warehouse, the statute continues, 'shall be kept securely locked, and shall at no time be unlocked, or opened, or remain open, unless in the presence of such storekeeper, or other person who may be designated to act for him, as provided by law; and no articles shall be received in or delivered from such warehouse except on an order or permit addressed to the storekeeper and signed by the collector having control of the warehouse' ( 3274). Under the departmental regulations 'the only lock to the warehouse door must be the government lock, the key of which must at all times be in charge of the storekeeper.' There must be an immediate removal of the distilled spirits to the distillery warehouse as soon as they are drawn into casks or packages and gauged, proved, and marked, as required, and thereupon the internal revenue gauger 'shall, in the presence of the storekeeper of the warehouse, place upon the head of the cask or package an engraved stamp, which shall be signed by the collector of the district and storekeeper and gauger; and shall have written thereon the number of proof-gallons con- \n\n[232 U.S. 174, 183]\n\u00a0\n tained therein, the name of the distiller, the date of the receipt in the warehouse, and the serial number of each cask or package, in progressive order, as the same are received from the distillery' ( 3287; act of May 28, 1880, 21 Stat. at L. 147, chap. 108,  6, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2130). The spirits must be entered for deposit in the warehouse under the regulations prescribed by the commissioner, and bond must be given for the payment of the tax. The statute gives the form of the entry which, made in triplicate and duly verified, must set forth the name of the person making it, the designation of the warehouse, the specification of the spirits deposited, with the marks and serial numbers of the packages, etc., and a statement of the amount of tax. Withdrawal may be made on payment of the tax-which is payable within eight years-by application to the collector in charge of the warehouse, and the making of a withdrawal entry ( 3293, 3294, act of May 28, 1880, 21 Stat. at L. 145, 146, chap. 108,  4, 5, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2133, 2135; act of August 27, 1894, 28 Stat. at L. 563, chap. 349,  49, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2141). Provision is made for regauging and for an allowance for loss from leakage or evaporation ( id.  50; act of March 3, 1899, chap. 435, 30 Stat. at L. 1349, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2147; act of Jan. 13, 1903, chap. 134, 32 Stat. at L. 770, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 955); and after four years the spirits may be bottled in bond, in a separate portion of the warehouse, set apart for that purpose, under the supervision of the government official (act of March 3, 1897, chap. 379, 29 Stat. at L. 626, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2150). The storekeeper is to keep 'a warehouse-book' in which all deposits and deliveries are to be entered with appropriate description, including marks and serial numbers ( 3301). And the removal 'of and distilled spirits from a distillery warehouse . . . in any manner other than is provided by law' is punishable by fine and imprisonment ( 3296).\n The minute regulations of the statute, and the provision for prolonged governmental control, proceed upon a recognition of the exigencies of the business. It is a \n\n[232 U.S. 174, 184]\n\u00a0\n matter of common knowledge that the product is not ready to be marketed for consumption when it is drawn from the still. It must undergo an aging process, and for this purpose it is kept in store for several years. In laying the tax, Congress has taken this necessity into consideration, permitting a long postponement of the required payment, the spirits meanwhile being held in charge of the government's representative. It is, however, a matter of obvious business importance that the distiller should be able to release the capital represented in the cost of production of the spirits in store, and to make it available for further production; and hence the practice is well established to deal with the product in the bonded warehouse by sale or pledge, storage certificate suitably identifying the property being delivered in lieu of the actual transfer of possession. The district court found as a fact that it is 'the unbroken custom of the trade to treat storage receipts for spirits as completely equivalent to the spirits themselves, and to sell or pledge them freely without question.' This finding is approved by the circuit court of appeals, and the fact that this custom exists we understand to be undisputed.\n It is argued for the appellant that one cannot make himself a warehouseman of his own goods, and isues so-called receipts to take the place of the delivery which the law requires to give effect to his sale or pledge (Security Warehousing Co. v. Hand, \n206 \nU.S. 415, 422\n, 51 S. L. ed. 1117, 1122, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 720, 11 Ann. Cas. 789; Trademen's Nat. Bank v. Thomas Kent Mfg. Co. 186 Pa. 556, 65 Am. St. Rep. 876, 40 Atl. 1018). The argument ignores the special circumstances of the case and the restrictions imposed by law upon the distiller. The building is his, but the government is in complete control. The spirits are his, but he is subject to fine and imprisonment if he attempts to remove them. It is undoubtedly true that the government is not strictly a bailee. It assumes no responsibility to the distiller for the safekeeping of the goods ( United States v. Witten, \n143 \nU.S. 76, 78\n, 36 S. L. ed. 81, 82, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 372). But the immunity \n\n[232 U.S. 174, 185]\n\u00a0\n which is incident to the exercise of governmental power in no way limits its effect upon the distiller's relation to the goods. They are effectually taken out of his power, so that he is absolutely unable to make a physical delivery of them until the tax is paid. On the other hand, to pay the tax and remove the property before the aging process is completed would defeat the object of the deposit for which the statute provides, and would frustrate the purpose of a transfer of spirits in bond, which is an entirely lawful transaction. In these circumstances, the certificates-such as were here used-appropriately represent the property.\n It is said that the distiller need not use his own warehouse, but may place the goods in one of he general bonded warehouses established under the act of 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 564, 565, chap. 349). The appellee asserts that this would be impracticable; that no general bonded warehouse had been established in the collection district in question; that there are only twelve in the entire country, with a capacity that is extremely small in comparison with the output of the distilleries. But, aside from this, the distillery warehouse is equally recognized by law; it is 'a bonded warehouse of the United States.' If it is a fit place for storage, the distiller is not obliged to remove the spirits elsewhere. And while they are thus deposited in conformity with law, he is not debarred from passing title or creating a special interest by way of pledge.\n The fundamental objection is that the custom, to which the entire trade is adjusted, is opposed to public policy. But we know of no ground for thus condemning honest transactions which grow out of the recognized necessities of a lawful business. The case is not one where credit may be assumed to be given upon the faith of the ostensible ownership of goods in the debtor's possession. Everyone dealing with distillers is familiar with the established practice in accordance with which spirits are held in store, \n\n[232 U.S. 174, 186]\n\u00a0\n under governmental control, and are transferred by the delivery of such documents as we have here. There is no warrant for saying that creditors are misled by delusive appearances. The usage serves a fair purpose and there is no public policy which requires that the trade should be thrown into disorder by a refusal to uphold it. It is urged that frauds may be perpetrated by the duplication of such documents; but the present dispute does not call for the determination of the equities as between two innocent purchasers. We are concerned here simply with the rights of creditors represented by a trustee in bankruptcy, and we agree with the court below in its conclusion that, in the circumstances disclosed, his right is inferior to that of the appellee.\n The decree is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","217":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTAYLOR v. ANDERSON(1914)\nNo. 338\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1914\n\n\n\n Mr. Napoleon B. Maxey for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. H. A. Ledbetter for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n The judgment here under review is one of dismissal for want of jurisdiction. The action was in ejectment. The petition alleged that the plaintiffs were owners in fee and entitled to the possession; that the defendants had forcibly taken possession and were wrongfully keeping the plaintiffs out of possession, and that the latter were damaged thereby in a sum named. Nothing more was required to state a good cause of action. Snyder's Comp. Laws (Okla.)  5627, 6122; Joy v. St. Louis, \n201 \nU.S. 332, 340\n, 780 S., 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 478. But the petition, going beyond what was required, alleged \n\n[234 U.S. 74, 75]\n\u00a0\n with much detail that the defendants were asserting ownership in themselves under a certain deed, and that it was void under the legislation of Congress restricting the alienation of lands allotted to the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians. However essential or appropriate these allegations might have been in a bill in equity to cancel or annul the deed, they were neither essential nor appropriate in a a petition in ejectment. Apparently, their purpose was to anticipate and avoid a defense which it was supposed the defendants would interpose; but, of course, it rested with the defendants to select their ground of defense, and it well might be that this one would not be interposed. In the orderly course, the plaintiffs were required to state their own case in the first instance, and then to deal with the defendants' after it should be disclosed in the answer. Snyder's Comp. Laws,  5634, 5642, 5668; Boston & M. Consol. Copper & S. Min. Co. v. Montana Ore Purchasing Co. \n188 \nU.S. 632, 639\n, 631 S., 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 434. Diversity of citizenship was not alleged, and, unless the allegations respecting the invalidity, under the legislation of Congress, of the defensive claim attributed to the defendants, operated to bring the case within the jurisdiction of the circuit court, the judgment of dismissal was plainly right.\n It is now contended that these allegations showed that the case was one arising under the laws of the United States,-namely, the acts restricting the alienation of Choctaw and Chickasaw allotments,-and therefore brought it within the circuit court's jurisdiction. But the contention overlooks repeated decisions of this court by which it has become firmly settled that whether a case is one arising under the Constitution or a law or treaty of the United States, in the sense of the jurisdictional statute (now  24, Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1091, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 135]), must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff's statement of his own claim in the bill or declaration, unaided by anything alleged in anticipation or avoidance of defenses which \n\n[234 U.S. 74, 76]\n\u00a0\n it is thought the defendant may interpose.

Ledbetter for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Cornelius Hardy, A. C. Cruce, W. I. Cruce, and W. R. Bleakmore for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit by the heirs of Maggie Taylor, a member of the Chickasaw tribe of Indians, against the plaintiff in error, her husband and devisee, to recover her allotment, which she devised to him. The answer relied upon the \n\n[235 U.S. 42, 43]\n\u00a0\n will, the plaintiffs demurred, and the courts of Oklahoma sustained the demurrer and gave judgment for the plaintiffs. 33 Okla. 199, 126 Pac. 573. The question is whether the devise was invalid under the supplemental agreement with the Choctaws and Chickasaws, ratified by the act of Congress of July 1, 1902, chap. 1362, 32 Stat. at L. 641.\n By 12 of the above act 'each member of said tribes shall, at the time of the selection of his allotment, designate as a homestead out of said allotment land equal in value to one hundred and sixty acres of the average allottable land of the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations, as nearly as may be, which shall be inalienable during the lifetime of the allottee, not exceeding twenty-one years from the date of certificate of allotment, and separate certificate and patent shall issue for said homestead.' By 16 all lands allotted to members of said tribes except homestead shall be alienable after issue of patent, one fourth in acreage in one year, one fourth in three years, and the rest in five years; but not for less than its appraised value before the expiration of the tribal governments. The plaintiff in error, in aid of the construction of 12, 16, for which he contends, and to show that transactions inter vivos alone were aimed at by the word 'inalienable,' invokes 15, which enacts that allotted lands 'shall not be affected or encumbered by any deed, debt, or obligation of any character contracted prior to the time at which said land may be alienated under this act, nor shall said lands be sold except as herein provided.'\n The land in question was allotted to Maggie Taylor in 1903, including, it would seem, a homestead; patents were issued on December 20, 1904, and were approved by the Secretary of the Interior and delivered on December 28, 1904. She made her will on March 22 and died on March 25, 1905, so that if the foregoing prohibitions extend to a devise, they include the one under which the plaintiff in error claims. Obviously they could be read in a narrower \n\n[235 U.S. 42, 44]\n\u00a0\n SENSE, AND WHICHEVER INTERPRETATION BE adopted, it would not be helped by long discussion. In view of the evils sought to be prevented, and in aid of what we understand to have been the policy of the Indians and the United States in their agreement, we are of opinion that the supreme court of this state was right in extending the prohibition to wills. To the same effect is Hayes v. Barringer, 93 C. C. A. 507, 168 Fed. 221. See also Jackson v. Thompson, 38 Wash. 282, 80 Pac. 454.\n A further and distinct argument is based upon the act to provide for additional judges, etc., of April 28, 1904, chap. 1824,  2, 33 Stat. at L. 573, to the effect that all the laws of Arkansas theretofore put in force in the Indian Territory are extended to embrace all persons and estates in said territory, whether Indians, freedmen, or otherwise, and full jurisdiction is conferred upon the district courts in the settlement of all estates of decedents, and the guardianship of minors and incompetents, whether Indians, freedmen, or otherwise. The Arkansas law of wills was a part of the law that thus had been adopted for the Indian Territory before 1904, and it is contended that the result of the above extension was to free the Indians from the restrictions so specifically imposed upon them in 1902. Of course, nothing of that sort was intended. As said below, the extension enabled 'the Indian to devise all his alienable property by will made in accordance with the laws of the state of Arkansas, but did not operate to remove any of the restrictions theretofore placed upon lands of Indians by act of Congress.' That this was the understanding of Congress is indicated by acts of April 26, 1906, chap. 1876,  23, 34 Stat. at L. 137, 145, and May 27, 1908, chap. 199, 35 Stat. at L. 312, giving Indians power to dispose of their allotments by will.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","219":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTAYLOR v.

McKenney, John Spalding Flannery, and William Hitz for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 363, 365]\n\u00a0\n No brief was filed for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The plaintiff in error and defendant in error are respectively the widow and father of one Howard Taylor, a resident of Orange county, state of New York, who, through the negligence of the Erie Railroad Company, met with an accident which caused his death.\n Plaintiff in error was appointed the administratrix of his estate, with right to prosecute any right of action granted by special provision of law as such administratrix. She brought suit, as such administratrix, against the railroad company for damages, alleging the employment of her husband in interstate commerce upon a train running from Port Jervis, New York, to Jersey City, New Jersey, the negligence of the railroad company as the cause of his death, and that the action was brought under the act of Congress of April 22, 1908 [35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1322], entitled, 'An Act Relating to Liability of Common Carriers by Railroads to their Employees in Certain Cases,' known as the employers' liability law.\n By permission or the surrogate of Orange county, she compromised with the railroad, accepting a judgment for $5,000.\n Defendant in error filed a petition in the supreme court of Orange county for an order directing plaintiff in error to pay over to him one half of the net proceeds of the judgment in accordance with the statute of distribution of the state. The motion was denied and an order was entered determining that plaintiff in error, as widow of the deceased, was entitled to receive and retain for her own use all of the net proceeds of the judgment. The order was reversed by the appellate division of the supreme court, and the judgment of reversal, on appeal to the court of appeals, was affirmed and the record re- \n\n[232 U.S. 363, 366]\n\u00a0\n mitted to the supreme court. This writ of error was then prosecuted.\n The appellate division was of opinion that the law of the state gave the right of action and determined the distribution of the proceeds of the judgment. Considering the act of Congress and its provisions, the court was of the view that the act of Congress 'should be construed as one granting a new remedy under certain circumstances, where none, or a less adequate one, existed under the state laws, and as not intended to supplant or abrogate a right of action of practically equal extent existing under the laws of this state.' [144 App. Div. 641, 129 N. Y. Supp. 378.] The court further said: 'It is only on the theory that this act of Congress constitutes the exclusive rule applicable to the facts of the case before us that the order of the special term [the order under review] can be upheld. If the remedy afforded by our laws be concurrent with that provided by Congress, then we think that our public policy will not permit an administratrix appointed by our courts under our laws, to use the Federal statute simply for the purpose of defeating our statute of distribution of personal property.' The court of appeals expressed the opinion that the case presented a case of conflict between the Federal and state statutes, and determined that the state statutes must prevail. It was said that the power of Congress 'to regulate interstate commerce must end somewhere, and so far as employees of common carriers engaged in interstate commerce are concerned, it appears to us that it must end with the death of the employee.' [204 N. Y. 140, 97 N. E. 502, Ann. Cas. 1913 D. 276.] And considering that the consequences of a contrary doctrine would give Congress power over the distribution of real estate which might happen to be purchased by the earnings of an employee in interstate commerce, the court declared that the act of Congress, in so far as it attempted to distribute the funds in controversy, was 'invalid and unauthorized.' There were dissenting opinions expressed. The judgment of the \n\n[232 U.S. 363, 367]\n\u00a0\n appellate division of the supreme court was affirmed, and the record was remitted to the supreme court, to be proceeded upon according to law, and the judgment of the latter court was entered conformably thereto.\n We have had many occasions to declare the comprehensive and exclusive power which Congress possesses over interstate commerce. And starting with that power as a factor, we have only to consider the breadth and meaning of the act of Congress.\n Section 1 provides that every common carrier by railroad, while engaged in interstate commerce, 'shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce, or, in case of the death of such employee, to his or her personal representative, for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children of such employee; and, if none, then of such employee's parents; and, if none, then of the next of kin, dependent upon such employee, for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier,' or by reason of any defect in its instrumentalities.\n Section 6, as amended April 5, 1910, provides that the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several states, and if the action be brought in a state court it shall not be removed to a court of the United States.\n Section 9, as amended, is as follows:\n'That any right of action given by this act to a person suffering injury shall survive to his or her personal representative, for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children of such employee, and, if none, then of such employee's parents; and, if none, then of the next of kin dependent upon such employee; but in such cases there shall be only one recovery for the same injury.' [36 Stat. at L. 291, chap. 143, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1324.] \n\n[232 U.S. 363, 368]\n\u00a0\n The act has come up for consideration in a number of cases. In Second Employers' Liability Cases (Mondou v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co.) \n223 U.S. 1\n, 56 L. ed. 327, 38 L.R.A. (N.S.) 44, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 169, 1 N. C. C. A. 875, it and its amendments were declared to be constitutional; that having been enacted in pursuance of a power reserved to Congress, state laws must give away to them. They established the policy for all, it was decided, and the courts of a state cannot refuse to enforce them on the ground that they are not in harmony with the policy of the state. Congress having acted, it was said, 'the laws of the states, in so far as they cover the same field, are superseded; for necessarily that which is not supreme must yield to that which is.'\n\n In Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Wulf, \n226 U.S. 570\n, 57 L. ed. 355, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 135, the Mondou Case was applied. The action was brought by the mother of a deceased employee in interstate commerce, under the state statute. The petition was subsequently amended to embrace a right of action by her under the Federal law as the personal representative of the decedent. The amendment was held not to be the commencement of a new action. It was said that notwithstanding the original petition asserted a cause of action under the state statute without making reference to the act of Congress, the court was presumed to be cognizant of the Federal enactment, and 'to know that, with respect to the responsibility of interstate carriers by railroad to their employees injured in such commerce after its enactment, it had the effect of superseding state laws upon the subject.'\n In Michigan C. R. Co. v. Vreeland, \n227 U.S. 59\n, 57 L. ed. 417, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 192, it is again said that the act of Congress has undertaken to cover the subject of the liability of railroad companies to their employees injured while engaged in interstate commerce, and that state legislation was superseded by it. 'The obvious purpose of Congress,' it was said, 'was to save a right of action to certain relatives dependent upon an employee wrongfully injured, for the loss and \n\n[232 U.S. 363, 369]\n\u00a0\n lamage resulting to them financially by reason of the wrongful death.' And again, 'It is one beyond that which the decedent had,-one proceeding upon altogether different principles.'\n The same view was expressed in American R. Co. v. Didricksen, \n227 U.S. 145\n, 57 L. ed. 456, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 224. The action was by surviving parents, they being the sole beneficiaries under the statute. A distinction was expressed between a cause of action to an injured employee, and in case of his death, a cause of action to dependent relatives; and of the first it was said that it does not survive his death, but that in such case the act 'creates a new and distinct right of action for the benefit of the dependent relatives named in the statute' for the damages which result to them because they have been deprived of a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefits on account of his wrongful death.\n In Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. McGinnis, \n228 U.S. 173\n, 57 L. ed. 785, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 426, 3 N. C. C. A. 806, the statute was again considered as giving a cause of action to the personal representative of the deceased employee for the benefit of the persons designated because of the pecuniary loss resulting to them.\n In St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Hesterly, \n228 U.S. 702\n, 57 L. ed. 1031, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 703, the same principles were applied. In St. Louis, S. F. & T. R. Co. v. Seale, \n229 U.S. 156\n, 57 L. ed. 1129, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 651, the action was by the widow and parent of an interstate commerce employee. The petition stated a case under the state statute. The railroad company contended that the Federal statute was the applicable one. There was a conflict between the statutes. The state statute gave the right of action to the surviving husband, wife, children, and parents; the Federal statute vested the right of action in the personal representative of the deceased for certain named beneficiaries, the parents of the deceased having no rights if there be a widow, husband, or children. The railroad company, therefore, interposed the objec- \n\n[232 U.S. 363, 370]\n\u00a0\n tion grounded on the Federal statute that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover on the case proved. The state court overruled the objection and we declared the ruling to be error. We said: 'Two of the plaintiffs, the father and mother, in whose favor there was a separate recovery, are not even beneficiaries under the Federal statute, there being a surviving widow; and she was not entitled to recover in her own name, but only through the deceased's personal representative, as is shown by the terms of the statute and the decisions before cited.'\n These cases were all brought under the statute as originally enacted and before the amendments of 1910. Section 1, however, was not amended, and in St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Hesterly, supra, it was said that the amendment of April 5, 1910, which added  9, quoted above, 'in like manner allows but one recovery, although it provides for survival of the right of the injured person.'\n It is clear from these decisions that the source of the right of plaintiff in error was the Federal statute; and this whether the cause of action is based on the 1st section of the act or on  9, added in 1910. From plaintiff in error's complaint against the railroad company it is not clear whether she counted on  1 alone or on that and  9. If under  1, the cause of action was not derived from the deceased in the sense of a succession from him. As said in one of the cited cases, her cause of action was 'one beyond that which the decedent had,-one proceeding upon altogether different principles.' It came to her, it is true, on account of his death, but because of her pecuniary interest in his life and the damage she suffered by his death. It was her loss, not that which his father may have suffered. The judgment she recovered was for herself alone. He had no interest in it. Any loss he may have suffered was not and could not have been any part of it, as we have seen. \n\n[232 U.S. 363, 371]\n\u00a0\n If the action included a right under  9, the recovery was for her benefit exclusively as the widow of the decedent. The language of the section is that the right of action given to the employee survives to his personal representatives for the benefit of his parents only when there is no widow.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","220":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTENNESSEE COAL, IRON & R. CO. v. GEORGE(1914)\nNo. 299\nArgued: March 17, 1914Decided: April 13, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 354, 355]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Alexander W. Smith for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Reuben R. Arnold for defendant in error. \n\n[233 U.S. 354, 358]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar delivered the opinion of the court:\n Wiley George, the defendant in error, was an engineer employed by the Tennessee Coal, Iron, & Railroad Company at its steel plant in Jefferson county, Alabama. While he was under a locomotive repairing the brakes a defective throttle allowed steam to leak into the cylinder, causing the engine to move forward automatically, in consequence of which he was seriously injured. He brought suit by attachment, in the city court of Atlanta, Georgia, founding his action on  3910 of the Alabama Code, which makes the master liable to the employee when the injury is 'caused by reason of any defect in the condition of the ways, works, machinery, or plant connected with or used in the business of the master or employer.'\n The defendant filed a plea in abatement in which it was set out that  6115 of that Code also provided that 'all actions under  3910 must be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction within the state of Alabama, and not elsewhere.' The defendant thereupon prayed that the action be abated because 'to continue said case of said statutory cause of action given by the statutes of Alabama, and restrictetd by said statutes to the courts of Alabama, would be a denial so far as the rights of this defendant are concerned of full faith and credit to said public acts of the state of Alabama in the state of Georgia, contrary to the provisions of art. 4,  1 of the Constitution of the United States.' A demurrer to the plea in abatement was sustained and the judgment for the plaintiff thereafter entered was affirmed by the court of appeals. The case was then brought to this court.\n The record raises the single question as to whether the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution prohibited the courts of Georgia from enforcing a cause of action \n\n[233 U.S. 354, 359]\n\u00a0\n given by the Alabama Code, to the servant against the master, for injuries occasioned by defective machinery, when another section of the same Code provided that suits to enforce such liability 'must be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction within the state of Alabama, and not elsewhere.'\n There are many cases where right and remedy are so united that the right cannot be enforced except in the manner and before the tribunal designated by the act. For the rule is well settled that 'where the provision for the liability is coupled with a provision for the special remedy, that remedy, that alone, must be employed.' Pollard v. Bailey, 20 Wall. 527, 22 L. ed. 378; Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Wallace, \n223 U.S. 490\n, 56 L. ed. 522, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 205; Stewart v. Baltimore & O. R. Co. \n168 U.S. 445\n, 42 L. ed. 537, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 105; Fourth Nat. Bank v. Francklyn, \n120 U.S. 753\n, 30 L. ed. 828, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 757.\n But that rule has no application to a case arising under the Alabama Code relating to suits for injuries caused by defective machinery. For, whether the statute be treated as prohibiting certain defenses, as removing common-law restrictions, or as imposing upon the master a new and larger liability, it is in either event evident that the place of bringing the suit is not part of the cause of action,-the right and the remedy are not so inseparably united as to make the right dependent upon its being enforced in a particular tribunal. The cause of action is transitory, and like any other transitory action can be enforced 'in any court of competent jurisdiction within the state of Alabama . . .' But the owner of the defective machinery causing the injury may have removed from the state, and it would be a deprivation of a fixed right if the plaintiff could not sue the defendant in Alabama because he had left the state, nor sue him where the defendant or his property could be found because the statute did not permit a suit elsewhere than in Alabama. The injured plaintiff may likewise have moved from Alabama, and for that, or other, reason may have found it to his interest to \n\n[233 U.S. 354, 360]\n\u00a0\n bring suit by attachment or in personam in a state other than where the injury was inflicted.\n The courts of the sister state, trying the case, would be bound to give full faith and credit to all those substantial provisions of the statute which inhered in the cause of action, or which name conditions on which the right to sue depend. But venue is no part of the right; and a state cannot create a transitory cause of action and at the same time destroy the right to sue on that transitory cause of action in any court having jurisdiction. That jurisdiction is to be determined by the law of the court's creation, and cannot be defeated by the extraterritorial operation of a statute of another state, even though it created the right of action.\n The case here is controlled by the decision of this court in Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Sowers, \n213 \nU.S. 55, 70\n, 53 S. L. ed. 695, 702, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 397, where the New Mexico statute, giving a right of action for personal injuries, and providing that suits should be brought after certain form of notice in a particular district, was preceded by the recital that 'it has become customary for persons claiming damages for personal injuries received in this territory to institute and maintain suits for the recovery thereof in other states and territories, to the increased cost and annoyance and manifest injury and oppression of the business interests of this territory and the derogation of the dignity of the courts thereof.' Despite this statement of the public policy of the territory, the judgment obtained by the plaintiff in Texas was affirmed by this court in an opinion wherein it was said that where an action is brought in 'another jurisdiction, based upon common-law principles, although having certain statutory restrictions, such as are found in this [ territorial] act, as to the making of an affidavit, and limiting the time of prosecuting the suit, full faith and credit is given to the law when the recovery is permitted, subject to the restrictions upon the right of action imposed in the territory enacting \n\n[233 U.S. 354, 361]\n\u00a0\n the statute. . . . When it is shown that the court in the other jurisdiction observed such conditions, and that a recovery was permitted after such conditions had been complied with, the jurisdiction thus invoked is not defeated because of the provision of the statute' requiring the suit to be brought in the district where the plaintiff resides or where the defendant, if a corporation, has its principal place of business.\n It is claimed, however, that the decision in the Sowers Case is not in point because the plaintiff was there seeking to enforce a common-law liability, while here he is asserting a new and statutory cause of action. But that distinction marks no difference between the two cases because in New Mexico common-law liability is statutory liability,-the adopting statute (Comp. Laws,  1823) providing that 'the common law, as recognized in the United States of America, shall be the rule of practice and decision.'\n The decision in the Sowers Case, however, was not put upon the fact that the suit was based on a common-law liability. The court there announced the general rule that a transitory cause of action can be maintained in another state even though the statute creating the cause of action provides that the action must be brought in local domestic courts.\n In the present case the Georgia court gave full faith and credit to the Alabama act and its judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice Holmes dissents. \n\n\n\n","221":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTERRITORY OF ARIZONA EX REL.

Clark, William G. Gilmore, and William C. Prentiss for appellant.\n Messrs. Frederick N. Judson, E. E. Ellinwood, and John F. Green for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was a special statutory proceeding (Laws of Territory of Arizona, 1903, act No. 92, p. 148) brought in the district court of the second judicial district of the territory of Arizona in and for the county of Cochise to enforce the lien of the territory for the payment of taxes for the year 1901, assessed against certain patented mining claims in the county of Cochise, amounting to $120,039.35, the tax being assessed upon the increased valuation of the mining claims of the company, made by the board of supervisors of Cochise county. In the trial court judgment was rendered for the defendant. Upon appeal to the supreme court of the territory of Arizona the judgment was affirmed (13 Ariz. 198, 108 Pac. 960 ). An appeal was prosecuted to this court under the statute regulating appeals from territorial courts (18 Stat. at L. 27 chap. 80). \n\n[233 U.S. 87, 89]\n\u00a0\n The supreme court of the territory of Arizona made a statement of facts in the nature of a special verdict, and upon that finding this court must consider the case on this appeal. Eagle Min. & Improv. Co. v. Hamilton, \n218 \nU.S. 513, 515\n, 54 S. L. ed. 1131, 1132, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 27; Zeckendorf v. Steinfeld, \n225 \nU.S. 445, 449\n, 56 S. L. ed. 1156, 1161, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 728. From the facts thus found the following appears:\n The appellee, a corporation doing business and owning real and personal property in Cochise county, Arizona, listed and returned for assessment in 1901 sixty-five mining claims belonging to it, by name, but as one tract, said to contain 636 acres, and valued at $3,180, with improvements valued at $55,431.76. Some of the claims are not contiguous to the others.\n On July 17, 1901, the county board of supervisors, sitting as the board of equalization for Cochise county, after notice to the company and hearing at which appellee's superintendent and agent appeared, raised the assessment upon eight of the sixty-five claims originally assessed en masse, in amounts varying from $50,000 to $1,000,000.\n Prior to September, 1901, the appellee brought suit in the district court of Cochise county to enjoin the collection of the tax, alleging that the increase had been fraudulently made and the property overvalued. It tendered the sum of $14,133.12, being the amount of the tax upon all of its property before the increase. The district court found that the increase was not based upon information or evidence, but was made arbitrarily and capriciously for the purpose of imposing an unjust share of the burden of taxation upon the appellee, and granted the injunction, upon condition, however, that the appellee pay the $14,133.12 into court and also the further sum of $9,589.20, the tax upon the increase in valuation of certain personal property, which the district court found to be valid. The $14,133.12 was accepted by the county treasurer, who was ex officio tax collector, 'on account of any \n\n[233 U.S. 87, 90]\n\u00a0\n moneys which might ultimately be determined as due from said company for its taxes for said year.' The supreme court, upon appeal, reversed the case and remanded it for new trial (Cochise County v. Copper Queen Consol. Min. Co. 8 Ariz. 221, 71 Pac. 946). Subsequently, an agreement of compromise was made, under authority of a resolution of the board of supervisors, the appellee paying the further sum of $5,661.44 in full settlement of taxes for the year 1901, and the injunction suit being dismissed. This last amount has been retained by the county.\n Thereafter a mandamus suit was instituted to compel the tax collector to commence suit against the appellee for the balance of the 1901 tax, upon the ground that the compromise was void. The supreme court held that the board of supervisors had no authority to compromise the tax, and granted the writ (Territory v. Gaines, 11 Ariz. 270, 93 Pac. 281), in pursuance of which the present action was instituted.\n The uncontradicted testimony showed that the raise in the assessment of the eight claims was not based upon evidence as to value, and that it was in fact arbitrary, and also that some of the claims were assessed far in excess of their full cash value. The duplicate assessment roll made out by the assessor contained the increase made by the board of equalization, the eight claims which were raised being separately itemized by name, with the amounts of the respective increases set opposite the names, but with no statement of their original valuation or the total valuation of them or any of them.\n On the third Monday of December, 1901, the tax being unpaid, the tax collector turned in the delinquent list, certified by the board, giving the property of the defendant as shown in the assessment returned by the appellee, with the increases as they appeared on the duplicate assessment roll.\n Under the 1903 law delinquent property was carried \n\n[233 U.S. 87, 91]\n\u00a0\n into the back-tax book of that year, and this suit was brought to foreclose the territory's lien upon the pieces of property therein appearing. That book, which was put in evidence, gave the appellee's property, its total valuation, total tax, amount paid on account, and balance due. In enumerating the several tracts remaining unredeemed it showed sixty-five mining claims, containing 636 acres, valued en masse at $ 3,180, with improvements at $55,431, and named sixty-four claims; the number of acres, and all other valuations for real estate and improvements, were the same as in the other lists; and the list of increased valuations of the several claims and improvements was shown, but no total valuation of such separate pieces of property after the addition of the increase was given.\n The discrepancies in description of the claims between the complaint and the tax documents are stated, and mention is made that in none of the latter is the total assessed valuation of any individual piece of real estate or the amount of taxes due on any of the separate claims disclosed. And it is said that the testimony of the assessor showed that there were 280 patented mining claims in Cochise county at the time the 1901 assessment was made, and that they were and had been assessed at a uniform rate of $5 per acre as a rule.\n In its opinion the supreme court stated that the most important question raised upon the record was the validity of the action of the board of supervisors, sitting as a board of equalization, in raising the assessment upon eight of the group of sixty-five claims originally assessed in mass. After stating the minutes of the board's action, the court quotes  2654 of the Revised Statutes of 1887\n\n\n'. . . The board of equalization shall have power to determine whether the assessed value of any property is too small or too great, and may change and correct any valuation, either by adding thereto or deducting there- \n\n[233 U.S. 87, 92]\n\u00a0\n from, if the sum fixed in the assessment roll be too small or too great, whether said sum was fixed by the owner or the assessor; . . . and the clerk of the board of equalization shall note upon the assessment roll all changes made by the board. During the session of the board of equalization the assessor shall be present, and also any deputy whose testimony may be required by the parties appealing to the board, and they shall have the right to make any statement touching such assessment, and producing evidence relating to questions before the board, and the board of equalization shall make use of all other information that they can gain otherwise, in equalizing the assessment roll of the county, and may require the assessor to enter upon such assessment roll any other property which has not been assessed; and the assessment and equalization so made shall have the same force and effect as if made by the assessor before the delivery of the assessment roll to (by) him by (to) the clerk of the board of equalization . . .'\n\n The court said (p. 212):\n'It is apparent from an examination of this roll [the duplicate assessment roll] that there are in effect two assessments for the same year against each of the eight claims raised. One, an assessment, commingles with that of sixty-four other claims, en bloc; the other separate and distinct. This is no mere irregularity. The legality of the original assessment as an entirety has been sustained solely upon the ground that the property was so returned by the taxpayer. The board disregarded such return, and the validity of its action must be determined under the statute alone. It might be argued successfully that had the board of supervisors raised the assessment upon the group, such a raise would have been valid. But the board segregated from the group certain claims, and imposed thereon an additional assessment. It is a fundamental rule of taxation in this territory that a taxpayer may pay \n\n[233 U.S. 87, 93]\n\u00a0\n upon any one of parcels separately assessed, discharging the lien thereon, without paying upon the remainder. Rev. Stat. 1887, 2676.\n\n ... * *\n'By the action of which complaint is made here, the board deprived the appellee of this right. Upon the raise being made it had the legal right to determine upon which, if any, of the claims so raised, it would pay. If it determined to pay upon none, it was nevertheless obliged to pay a portion of the tax thereon if it exercised its right to pay upon the fifty-seven claims remaining, for the tax collector, under 2676, supra (re-enacted, 3900, Revised Statutes of 1901), could not receive the tax upon less than the entire sixty-five claims, that being the least subdivision appearing on the assessment roll. If it determined to pay upon one or more of the eight so raised, and to abandon the remainder, it would have to pay the tax upon the raise, together with the tax upon the entire sixty-five claims as originally assessed. The undisputed testimony discloses that these claims were noncontiguous, in instances which would have invalidated an original assessment, except for the return. The board, in raising this assessment, disregarding the original classification, which has been held good as against the appellee solely by reason of its return. The board of supervisors, sitting as a board of equalization, had no power under 2654 of the Revised Statutes of 1887 to segregate, from a tract of land returned and assessed as one parcel, a portion thereof, and impose thereon an additional assessment, without first determining that such tract was improperly assessed as a whole, and causing such tract to be reassessed and raised in subdivisions in such manner as to preserve the right of the taxpayer to discharge the lien of taxes upon such of the several separate tracts as he might elect.'\n\n It is evident that in reaching this conclusion the su- \n\n[233 U.S. 87, 94]\n\u00a0\n preme court based its decision upon its construction of the statute in this respect. In exercising appellate jurisdiction over the territorial courts, where the construction placed upon a statute of the territory by the highest court thereof is brought in question, this court has frequently held that it will not reverse the action of the territorial court except in cases where manifest error in such construction appears. Straus v. Foxworth, \n231 U.S. 162\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 42; Phoenix R. Co. v. Landis, \n231 U.S. 578\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 179; Work v. United Globe Mines, \n231 U.S. 595\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 274. Applying this rule we are not prepared to say that there was manifest error in the conclusion reached by the supreme court in construing the statute. Indeed, the appellant in its brief filed in this case extracts from its motion for rehearing in the court below, and prints as a part of its argument, a statement to the effect that it is convinced that the board could not lawfully segregate the eight claims from the mass and raise the valuation separately, there being no separate assessment originally; but it contends that the value of the whole tract is equal to all its parts, so that when the value of a part is raised it merely increases the aggregate value of the whole tract. We are not prepared to say that the Arizona supreme court erred in its conclusion concerning what the board actually did. The original assessment, as the finding shows, contains a return of sixty-five mining claims, naming them as 636 acres of land. There was no separate statement of the amount of acreage in any one claim. The claims were not described except by name, and that as a part of the 636 acres returned as a whole. The supreme court found, and we think correctly, that the reassessment picked out eight claims by name and raised the valuation of each by a given sum.\n It is further contended by the appellant that certain things have happened as set forth in the findings which amount to an estoppel upon the appellee from denying \n\n[233 U.S. 87, 95]\n\u00a0\n the right to have a lien charged, as claimed in this proceeding, upon specific property, and to have the lien enforced by the sale of the specific lot or tract covered by it. The statute (part of which is quoted in the margin ) is a peculiar one, and is said to have been adopted from the statutes of Missouri. It provides for a civil action against the owners of the property, to the end that a lien be charged upon land the taxes on which have become delinquent, and that such lien be foreclosed. In Missouri it has been decided that no personal judgment shall be rendered in the proceedings against the owner of the property, nor any execution issue except upon the property charged with the tax. State ex rel. Rosenblatt v. Sargeant, 76 Mo. 557; State ex rel. Hayes v. Snyder, 139 Mo. 549, 41 S. W. 216. And the supreme court of the territory of Arizona held that the construction of the statute by the court of last resort of Missouri was binding upon it.\n In such a proceeding it is difficult to see how the principles of estoppel because of the description of the land made by the owner in returning the property or the payment of taxes, as appears from the finding in this case, could have application. Estoppel ordinarily proceeds upon principles which prevent one from denying the truth of statements upon which others have acted, where the denial would have the effect to mislead them to their prejudice.

The fact that the taxpayer furnished the list of mining claims which included those upon which increased assessments had been made, and thereby acknowledged the ownership of the property by the description stated, would not permit the board, if authority was wanting, to increase the assessment upon a part of the property by picking out certain claims only, as was done in this case. If for such action the assessment was void, the description furnished by the property owner could not supply the defect. State ex rel. Flentge v. Burrough, 174 Mo. 700, 707, 74 S. W. 610. Nor do we think there is substance in the claim that the payment made by the appellee estopped it from contesting the lien sought to be imposed in this case. The finding of facts sets forth specifically the payment of the sum of $14,133.12 and of the further sum of $9,589.20 as a condition for granting the injunction in the original suit brought by the appellee in the district court; and the finding shows that the payment of the sum of $ 14,133.12 was 'on account of any moneys which might ultimately be determined as due from said company for its tax for said year,' and that the sum of $5,661.44 was paid on the attempted compromise which was subsequently held to be invalid. We do not find anything in these payments which, upon principles of estoppel, or as an affirmation of the validity of the assessment, would prevent the appellee from contending against the legality of the action here in question.\n In the decision as made in the supreme court it was not found necessary to rule upon the attempted defenses based upon the arbitrary character of the assessment, nor \n\n[233 U.S. 87, 97]\n\u00a0\n the fact that it was in excess of the cash value of the property. The conclusion which we have reached renders it unnecessary for us to pass upon the findings in this respect, which, notwithstanding the decision in the court below, are placed in the special findings upon which the case is sent here.\n Nor de we need to pass upon the alleged violation of the equality protection of the Constitution in the finding that other patented mining claims in Cochise county at the time of the assessment in 1901 were assessed as a rule at the uniform rate of $5 per acre. Nor need we consider the ground upon which the supreme court of Arizona seems to have acted in part, that the assessment rolls and tax book varied from the complaint in the description of the property.\n It follows that the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Arizona must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","222":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTEVIS v. RYAN(1914)\nNo. 189\nArgued: Decided: April 6, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 273, 274]\n\u00a0\n This action was brought by defendants in error against Tevis and McKittrick, two of the plaintiffs in error, in a district court of one of the counties of the then territory of Arizona. The trial resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of plaintiffs below for $132,000. On appeal, the supreme court of the territory held that because of error affecting the amount of the damages, $64,564.63 of the verdict ought to be remitted, and that upon the filing of a remittitur judgment should be entered in favor of plaintiffs below for the remaining sum of $67,435.37. 13 Ariz. 120, 108 Pac. 461. Both parties filed petitions for a rehearing, with the result that the court adhered to its former view. 13 Ariz. 282, 114 Pac. 557. Plaintiffs having filed the remittitur, judgment was entered in their favor for the lastmentioned sum, and the present writ of error was sued out.\n The controversy arises out of the following transactions. In the year 1902 plaintiffs and defendants were stockholders in an Arizona corporation known as the Turquoise Copper Mining & Smelting Company, which owned mining properties in Cochise county, Arizona. The stock consisted of 100, 000 shares, of the par value of $10 each, of which the Ryans together owned four \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 275]\n\u00a0\n sevenths and Tevis and McKittrick owned three sevenths. The Ryans were in control of the board of directors. About $160,000 had been expended towards the development of the mines, and this had been contributed by the respective parties in proportion to their holdings of stock, plaintiffs having contributed about $90,000, defendants about $70,000. One Bryant had secured a judgment and levied execution upon the property of the company, under which the mines had been sold on July 30, 1902, to one McPherson, subject to redemption on or before January 31, 1903. In this situation of affairs plaintiffs met the defendant McKittrick in Wilcox, Arizona, on November 29, 1902, and, after some negotiation, a written contract was drawn up and by them signed. Defendant Tevis was not present at this meeting, and the agreement was made contingent upon his signing, as he did a few days later. It reads as follows:\n'This agreement, made and entered into this 29th day of November, 1902, by and between W. S. Tevis and W. H. McKittrick of Bakersfield, California, parties of the first part, and Jepp Ryan, T. C. Ryan, and E. B. Ryan, of Leavenworth, Kansas, parties of the second part,\n\n'Witnesseth, That, whereas, the parties above mentioned represent all the stock in the Turquoise Copper Mining & Smelting Company, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the territory of Arizona, and doing business in Cochise county, Arizona, and\n\n'Whereas, the parties of the first part now own and control three sevenths of the capital stock of the said corporation, and the parties of the second part four sevenths of the capital stock thereof; and\n\n'Whereas, the parties of the first part are desirous of securing the controlling interest of the said capital stock of the said corporation, and thereby obtain the full management of the affairs of the said corporation;\n\n'Now, therefore, in consideration of, that the capital \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 276]\n\u00a0\n stock of the said corporation shall be changed from its original capitalization to one million shares of the par value of one dollar each share, and that 240,000 of said shares of said capital stock shall be placed in the treasury of the said company, to be sold in whole or in part by the said parties of the first part, at such price or prices as the board of directors of said corporation may deem advisable, and the moneys received from such sale or sales shall be used as follows: First, to pay off and liquidate a certain judgment held by T. B. McPherson, of Omaha, Nebraska, or his assigns, against the said corporation, in the amount of about $25,532.47 dollars. Second, to use the next $20,000 received from the sale of said stock to develop the claims now owned and controlled by this company; the parties of the second part hereby agree to and with the parties of the first part, that the officers in the said corporation now representing the interest of the parties of the second part shall resign from said office or offices, and allow the parties of the first part to appoint or elect such officers in their place and stead as they may desire, said second parties agree to give the parties of the first part as their interest in the said company, a total of 280,500 shares of the capital stock thereof, and the parties of the second part shall receive as their portion 279,500 shares of capital stock of the said company. That the remaining 200,000 shares shall be divided between the parties hereto in the proportion of 101,000 shares to the first parties, and 99,000 shares to the parties of the second part; said 200,000 shares shall be issued to W. H. McKittrick, as trustee for the parties hereto. All of the parties hereto agree to use their best endeavors to sell as much of the said last- mentioned shares as possible, at not less than par value, and the proceeds of any of such sales of said block of stock shall be divided pro rata among the parties hereto, until they have been fully reimbursed for the money they now have expended upon this property, \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 277]\n\u00a0\n amounting to about $160,000, when the remaining shares shall be divided equally among them, according to their respective interests, in the ratio aforesaid.\n\n'It is further understood and agreed between the parties hereto that they shall not be allowed to sell any of their individual holdings of stock in this company until the block of 200,000 held in trust for all shall have been sold or apportioned, as above set forth. The parties of the second part shall not be liable for any expense connected with the operation of this company, excepting the expense of selling the stock held in trust for the parties hereto. The parties of the first part shall have a term of two years in which to comply with all the requirements of this contract. Should they fail or refuse to comply with all the agreements and stipulations herein mentioned within the period aforesaid, then this agreement shall become null and void and of no effect, otherwise to remain in full force and effect. Should this contract be annulled by any failure of the parties of the first part to do any and all things herein required of them, then the interest of the second parties shall reinvest in them in the same proportion and ratio as they held and were possessed of at the signing of this agreement.\n\n'It is further understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that W. S. Tevis, not being present upon the signing hereof, that ten days' time be allowed him in which to sign and ratify the same. Should he fail or refuse to do so within the period above mentioned, then this instrument shall be null and void in respect to all parties hereto. All erasures and changes and interlineations were made prior to the signing of this instrument.\n\n'Witness our hands, the day and year first above mentioned.'\n\n In accordance with the agreement, a reorganization of the company was effected, the Ryans resigned as directors, control of the directorate passed to Tevis and McKittrick, \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 278]\n\u00a0\n and the capital stock was changed so as to consist of 1,000,000 shares, of the par value of $1 each, which were allotted as prescribed by the contract, viz.:\n To Tevis and McKittrick 280,500 shares To the Ryans 279,500 \" To McKittrick as trustee 200,000 \" Treasury stock 240,000 \" ___ Total 1,000,000 \"\n The mines of the company were redeemed from the sheriff's sale with $ 30,000 loaned for the purpose by Tevis upon the company's note. This note, with others given by the company for the interest upon it, was transferred by Tevis to the Western Company of California, a corporation controlled by him.\n The reorganized Turquoise company did not prosper. Defendants sold 32, 000 shares of the treasury stock at 25c. per share, netting $8,000, and the remaining 208,000 shares at 3\/4c. per share, netting $1,560. This money was spent in operating the mines and in paying for a diamond drill, for patents, and for attorneys' fees. In May, 1905, the Western Company secured judgment against the company in a California court for the amount of the notes and interest, aggregating $44,078.05, and an action was brought on this judgment in Cochise county, Arizona, resulting on July 20, 1905, in a judgment for $44,549.43. On this same day McKittrick secured judgment against the company for $9,975 for services as general manager from May, 1903, to June, 1905. The following day (July 21, 1905) execution was levied against the mining properties to satisfy the judgments of McKittrick and the Western Company; and on July 11, 1906, the property was sold by the sheriff to that company. A few days later defendants, with others, organized the Tejon Mining Company under the laws of Arizona, and two years afterwards the Western Company conveyed the mining prop- \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 279]\n\u00a0\n erties formerly of the Turquoise Company to the Tejon Company.\n The present action was commenced November 30, 1906, and, after repeated modifications of the pleadings, came on for trial upon a complaint which, besides setting up the above facts, averred that after two years from the 29th day of November, 1902, had elapsed, and after plaintiffs were informed that defendants had failed to sell the 240,000 shares of the Turquoise Company for sufficient funds to pay the money advanced by them to redeem the property of the company from the sheriff's sale, and before the action of the Western Company against the Turquoise Company was commenced in the California court, to wit, on February 15, 1905, plaintiffs informed defendants that they desired to be reinvested with their interest in the property of the Turquoise Company, and to be restored to their interest therein the same as before November 29, 1902, and informed defendants that they were then ready, able, and willing to pay defendants four sevenths of the sum of $25,262.60 paid to redeem the property from the sale of July 31, 1902; and that defendants ignored said request. There were allegations of fraudulent conduct, in support of which certain evidence was introduced, but these allegations seem to have been abandoned; at least the trial judge submitted the case to the jury solely upon the ground of a breach of the contract.\n Messrs. Edward H. Thomas, A. B. Browne, Alexander Britton, Evans Browne, Ben Goodrich, and A. C. Baker for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Eugene S. Ives for defendants in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Pitney:\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n The trial judge in submitting the case to the jury \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 280]\n\u00a0\n adopted the following construction of the contract of November 29, 1902: That it provided for a general scheme to be carried out within the period of two years; that control of the Turquoise Company was to be given to defendants McKittrick and Tevis, and with a board of directors of their own choosing they were to carry on the business of the company, and within two years were to carry out the plan for the rehabilitation of the company according to the stipulations of the agreement; that they did not guarantee successful results, but were simply to use their best endeavors to carry out the plan; that if there was a failure on their part to do the things contemplated within the two years, this of itself did not raise any legal obligation on their part to the plaintiffs; but that if, at the end of the two years, the scheme contemplated by the contract had not been accomplished, then defendants agreed to reinvest plaintiffs with the interest they had at the time of entering into the contract, provided plaintiffs demanded that reinvestment. The jury were instructed that they should first determine whether, at the expiration of the two years specified in the contract, the situation was such that defendants were obligated to reinvest plaintiffs with the four-sevenths interest in the company that they formerly held. That if so, the next question was whether plaintiffs ever demanded that they should be so reinvested; for if there was no demand, there was no liability on the part of defendants; but that if plaintiffs did make such demand within a reasonable time after the expiration of the two years, it was the duty of defendants to comply with it; that certain evidence introduced to show a written demand made at a time in the summer of 1906 should be rejected because such demand, if made, came too late; but that if the jury should find [as, in fact, certain other evidence tended to show] that a demand was made on defendants by plaintiffs a few months following the expiration of the \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 281]\n\u00a0\n two years, and in the early part of 1905, that was a reasonable time in which to make the demand. The further instruction was that if there was a breach of the agreement by defendants in failing to reinvest plaintiffs as they ought to have done, the next question was the amount of the damages; and as to this, that what defendants agreed to do was to put plaintiffs back as nearly as might be in the situation they were in when the contract was made; that at that time the property was about to be foreclosed, and subsequently money was raised to redeem it from the judgment, and the money thus used became a debt against the company, and this should be considered by the jury, because plaintiffs ought not to be put back in possession of their interest in the property free and clear of any such encumbrance as stood upon it when the contract was made. 'So, if you should come to this question of damages at all, you should ascertain the damages in this way: You should ascertain the value of this mining property,-this property that was owned by the Turquoise Copper Mining & Smelting Company-at the time the demand of the Ryans to be reinvested was made, if any such demand was made at all,-ascertain first the value of that property. Then deduct from that value the amount of this claim of the Western Company which loaned this money, with interest, which at that time amounted to at least $39,000. Then take that balance, if there is any,-the value of the property, from which deduct the $39,000, and if there is any balance left,-that belongs to the plaintiffs and defendants in the proportion that they owned the property,-that is, the Ryans four sevenths and Tevis and McKittrick three sevenths. So the Ryans would be entitled to four sevenths of the balance after you deduct from the value of the property the amount of this Western Company's claim,-this $39,000. And of course it follows that if the value of the property was not so much as $39, 000, they would not be entitled to anything.' \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 282]\n\u00a0\n There were no requests for particular instructions, and no specific objection to the instructions as given.\n In the supreme court of the territory the principal question raised was as to the correctness of the instruction respecting the measure of damages. In passing upon this, the appellate court interpreted the contract as binding defendants (in the event of the failure of the scheme, and a demand made for reinvestment) to turn over to plaintiffs, not a four- sevenths interest in the mining property, but a four-sevenths interest in the capital stock of the company. At the same time it was held that the trial court, in apparently adopting as a measure of damages the four- sevenths interest in the property of the corporation, did not actually construe the reinvesting clause to extend to the property or the mines of the corporation, but that the instruction was tantamount to an instruction that plaintiffs were entitled to the value of four sevenths of the capital stock, which was the equivalent of, and was to be ascertained by determining from the evidence the value of, four sevenths of the net assets of the corporation. And the appellate court held, as to this, that the result was right, and hence the judgment ought not to be reversed, though the instruction as given might be open to criticism as to its form, and even though the jury might have based their verdict upon an incorrect theory.\n But it was held that the measure of damages as applied by the trial court was erroneous in failing to deduct from the valuation of the four sevenths a proper allowance for the 279,500 shares of stock of the Turquoise Company that had been retained by the Ryans under the terms of the contract, and were still owned by them.\n The court overruled certain minor contentions on the one side and on the other, and, finding that the proximate damage resulting from the breach of the contract was the loss of the value of the stock that was agreed to be returned, and that the loss of the value of the 279,500 shares \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 283]\n\u00a0\n retained (attributed, as it was, to subsequent mismanagement of the company by Tevis and McKittrick) was only a remote and indirect consequence, and not such as was in contemplation at the time of the making of the contract as a probable result of such breach, held that there was error (and error only) in including in the allowance of damages the loss of the value of the retained shares. The court further found that the evidence and the verdict of the jury afforded a basis for computing the correct sum to be awarded, in that the jury by its verdict found in effect that the value of the entire capital stock of 1,000,000 shares of the Turquoise Company at the time of the breach of the contract was $231, 000 (four sevenths of this sum being $132,000, the amount of the verdict). Taking four sevenths of the entire number of shares (or 571,428 shares) and deducting the 279,500 shares retained by the plaintiffs, there remained 291,928 shares, which, computed upon the basis afforded by the verdict of the jury, yielded $67,435.37 as the proper amount of the recovery. And under the provisions of 1588 of the Revised Statutes of 1901 and the practice approved in Kennon v. Gilmer, \n131 \nU.S. 22, 29\n, 33 S. L. ed. 110, 113, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 696, plaintiffs were put to their election to either remit the excess beyond that amount or submit to a new trial, with the result mentioned in the prefatory statement.\n It is now contended by plaintiffs in error that the interpretation of the contract adopted by the trial court, and followed by the appellate court, respecting the question of liability, is unwarranted by anything in the language of the instrument. It is said that Tevis and McKittrick did not agree, as the trial court held they did, that they personally would use their best endeavors to do the things that were in contemplation. It is said that the directors of the corporation were to fix the price of the treasury stock, and to use the money derived from its sale in the manner indicated; that Tevis and McKittrick were to be merely \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 284]\n\u00a0\n the agents of the board of directors (if that board should so determine), without authority to fix the price of the stock, pay the judgment, or use the money to develop claims, or in any other way for the company's benefit; that if the directors should fail to hive such authority, Tevis and McKittrick could do nothing; that they did not covenant or agree that the stock would sell for any particular price, much less that it would sell for $20,000 more than the amount of the judgment; that the terms of the agreement show merely the expectations of the parties, which, as the event befell, were not realized, and that the agreement and all its stipulations were conditional upon the sale of the stock for a sufficient price to meet the purposes indicated. The insistence is that the Ryans simply sold and transferred a controlling interest in the stock in consideration of a future authority to sell the treasury stock for a price in nowise fixed, and that there was no agreement that Tevis and McKittrick were to contribute or pay anything to the company; that, as between the corporation and the shareholders, the 240,000 shares of treasury stock were contributed outright to the corporation, which, by the terms of the agreement, had the right to sell it; and that Tevis and McKittrick did not undertake to bind the company to return or pay for this stock.\n The gist of the argument seems to be that Tevis and McKittrick incurred no personal liability except possibly to see to it that the capital stock of the company was changed from its original capitalization ( 100,000 shares, of the par value of $10 each) to 1,000,000 shares, of the par value of $1 each, that 250,000 of the new shares were placed in the treasury of the company, and that the board of directors of the corporation fixed a price for the sale of these shares.\n The agreement shows on its face that it was not prepared by a skilled person, and it requires construction. But we think it was binding upon defendants, at least to \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 285]\n\u00a0\n the extent that the decision of the territorial supreme court gave effect to it.\n The argument for plaintiffs in error attributes too little force to what is referred to as the 'reinvestment clause,' viz.: 'The parties of the first part shall have a term of two years in which to comply with all the requirements of this contract. Should they fail or refuse to comply with all the agreements and stipulations herein mentioned within the period aforesaid, then this agreement shall become null and void and of no effect; otherwise to remain in full force and effect. Should this contract be annulled by any failure of the parties of the first part to do any and all things herein required of them, then the interest of the second parties shall reinvest in them in the same proportion and ratio as they held and were possessed of at the signing of this agreement.' This imports, at least, that if the project for rehabilitating the company, in contemplation of which the Ryans devested themselves for the time of the majority interest and control of the company, should come to naught, they should be reinvested with the same proportion of the stock of the company that they had held before. But the company was not named as a party to the agreement, and, even if treated as a party by implication, could hardly be supposed to covenant for a transfer of the outstanding stock. Hence the covenant quoted could bind Tevis and McKittrick, only, who themselves were to be placed in control of the company, and of the very stock that would need to be retransferred in order to fulfil the stipulation. Consequently, it imports a personal responsibility on their part to see to it that the Ryans were 'reinvested' in accordance with the terms of the covenant.\n It is insisted that if certain declarations of McKittrick, said to have been made during the negotiations that immediately preceded the signing of the contract, be eliminated, there is nothing in the terms of the instrument, \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 286]\n\u00a0\n or in the circumstances under which it was made, to warrant the interpretation adopted. In this view we do not concur, for reasons already indicated.\n The declarations referred to are also said to have been erroneously admitted. They were made by McKittrick in the absence of Tevis at the interview of November 29, 1902. Jepp Ryan, one of the plaintiffs, being called as a witness and asked to state the conversation between McKittrick and himself, testified: 'He went out and had an agreement made and brought it up into our room. 'Now,' he says, 'Boys, Mr. Tevis is a multimillionaire and rich and influential, and by putting him in control of this property, or giving us control of the property, we will try to handle it so each of us can get all our money back.' I says, 'Captain, suppose you don't handle it, where do we come in.' He says, 'If we don't sell the stock we will return to you the property the same as it is to-day .\" It appeared that this was after the contract was drawn up and before it was signed. A motion was made to strike it out 'because the contract speaks for itself.' This, the only objection, was overruled. Each of the other plaintiffs was permitted, over the like objection, to give evidence of a similar import.\n If the action had been based alone upon the written instrument there would be force in the objection to the introduction of parol evidence of previous promises inconsistent with the terms of the writing. But the action was not so limited. The pleading upon which the parties went to trial (the third cause of action in the third amended and supplemental complaint) relied not upon the contract alone, but also upon alleged fraudulent conduct, beginning with representations of the abundant means and property of the defendants, on the strength of which, as was said, the plaintiffs entered into the written agreement, and followed by alleged fraudulent use of the control of the company that was turned over to Tevis and McKittrick \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 287]\n\u00a0\n in pursuance of the terms of the agreement. The evidence of the oral declarations of McKittrick was admissible upon this question; and the fact that the allegations of fraud were afterwards abandoned, or were held by the trial court not to be sufficiently supported, does not render erroneous the previous rulings upon the admissibility of the evidence referred to.\n For like reasons we find no error in the testimony to show that the Ryans were not notified, until long afterwards, that suit had been brought by the Western Company against the Turquoise Company in California, or that suit had been brought upon this judgment in Cochise county, Arizona. Assuming, for argument's sake, that defendants were under no duty to keep plaintiffs informed in regard to the status of the company, and that the contract did not require that they should do so, it nevertheless was a circumstance of more or less significance upon the question of fraud, that events of such consequence to the company were not communicated to parties who held legal and equitable rights such as the Ryans concededly held.\n It is contended that the appellate court erred in holding that there was sufficient evidence to show a demand for reinvestment made by plaintiffs upon defendants. The complaint alleged two such demands, one on February 15, 1905, the other on August 26, 1906. Plaintiffs introduced testimony in regard to an oral demand claimed to have been made in May, 1905, and it was upon this alone that the trial court permitted the case to go to the jury. It is contended that this demand was insufficient because not made in proper form, nor made in a proper place, and made only upon McKittrick, and not upon Tevis also. Assuming, as both courts held, that a special demand was necessary, it seems to us that the oral demand referred to is not open to the objections made to it. McKittrick and Tevis were joint contractors, so that notice to either was \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 288]\n\u00a0\n notice to both. And there is no doubt that it was sufficiently specific to fairly warn defendants that they were called upon to perform their engagement under the reinvestment clause.\n Objection is made to the trial court's ruling, sustained by the appellate court, admitting in evidence a written demand served by plaintiffs upon defendants, marked Exhibit 'K.' This was a letter, undated, but apparently written after July 11, 1906, and stated to have been served upon defendants in September of that year. Its admission was not objected to on the ground that it did not evidence a proper demand (this, indeed, was admitted), nor on the ground that the demand came too late, but only because of other matters contained in the letter. The trial court having refused to exclude it as evidence, subsequently instructed the jury that as a demand it came too late to furnish a proper support for plaintiffs' cause of action. The contention now is that because of self-serving declarations contained in it, Exhibit K ought to have been excluded entirely from the consideration of the jury, and that it was likewise inadmissible because it contained veiled charges of fraud on the part of the defendants, and also offers of compromise made by the plaintiffs. But we have already pointed out that the action was in part based upon fraud, and we are not prepared to say that the fact that Exhibit K contained insinuations attributing fraud to defendants, coupled with the fact that defendants did not respond to it, would not in some degree tend to support this charge. It is sufficient, however, to say that the paper was introduced as evidence of a demand, and was admissible for that purpose ( in the absence of objection based on the time of its delivery), since it contained a notice that plaintiffs insisted that defendants should comply, as well as might then be done, with the provisions of the agreement. The fact (if it were a fact) that it also contained matters irrelevant to the demand would not \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 289]\n\u00a0\n render the document inadmissible. The proper course would have been for defendants to request an instruction limiting the effect that should be given to it by the jury; or, if intending to insist that it came too late to constitute a proper demand, then to exclude the paper from consideration. The present objection was not properly raised at the trial.\n It is insisted that the court erred in holding that plaintiffs, under the averments of the complaint, were entitled to recover the value of a four-sevenths interest in the stock of the company. The basis of the objection is that such a recovery was inconsistent with the cause of action set forth in the complaint, which, it is said, sought a recovery of a four-sevenths interest in the property of the Turquoise Company, and not the value of four sevenths of its share stock. This is a mere question of pleading, and is sufficiently disposed of in the opinion of the appellate court below.\n It is contended that there was error in sustaining the trial court's instruction that the measure of plaintiff's damages was four sevenths of the value of the mining company's property, minus the indebtedness to the Western company. As already shown, however, the appellate court did not sustain this interpretation of the contract, but in terms rejected it; at the same time holding that the trial court, in referring to the value of a four-sevenths interest in the property of the corporation as a test for the measure of damages, in effect reached a correct result through the employment of inaccurate phraseology, and that although the jury may have found their verdict upon an incorrect theory, the error was harmless and the judgment should not be reversed, because under the evidence, the rule adopted made no substantial difference in the result, saving as to the 279, 500 shares, and as to this the error was easily cured by applying the proper correction, as above mentioned. \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 290]\n\u00a0\n Finally, the point is made that, assuming the alleged error of the trial court could be cured by a remittitur, the ruling of the supreme court and the remittitur as entered accounted only for the 279,500 shares that were retained by the Ryans under the contract; and it is insisted that the 200,000 shares of trust stock to which McKittrick held the legal title, with the 240,000 shares of treasury stock, the legal title to which was in the company, and over which defendants had no control except in their capacity as directors of the company, should have been deducted from the entire share capital of 1,000,000 shares, and the plaintiffs allowed only the value of four sevenths of the difference, less the 279,500 shares that they retained. Without spending further time in discussion, we will simply say that in our opinion the view suggested is inconsistent with the terms of the covenant, which were that in the contingency provided for 'the interest of the second parties shall reinvest in them in the same proportion and ratio as they held and were possessed of at the signing of this agreement.' This, we think, contemplated that they should be restored to the same proportionate interest that they held prior to the making of the agreement.\n In affirming the judgment we are not to be understood as holding that the rulings of the court below were undubitably correct. In dealing with the instructions of the trial court respecting the mode of ascertaining the damages, and in permitting the filing of a remittitur, and affirming the judgment for the residue of the verdict, the supreme court of the territory acted under Revised Statutes of Arizona 1901, 1588, which provides, in substance, that there shall be no reversal on an appeal or writ of error for want of form provided sufficient matter or substance be contained in the record to enable the court to decide the cause upon its merits; and also provides for remitting excessive damages pending the appeal. The record in the present case came fairly within the purview of \n\n[233 U.S. 273, 291]\n\u00a0\n this provision. And we are not disposed to lightly disturb the decision of a territorial supreme court turning so largely, as this does, upon the local practice. Phoenix R. Co. v.

The cases were consolidated for trial, subject to a plea to the jurisdiction filed by the Kansas City Southern Railway Company, which plea was afterward sustained and the suit as to that company dismissed. There was a trial, however, as to the Texas & Pacific Railway Company, resulting in a verdict and judgment thereon for $17,112.33, and the writ of error now before us is prosecuted by the railway company to a judgment of the court below affirming the trial court. 111 C. C. A. 673, 190 Fed. 1022\n\n\n At the close of the evidence a motion was made to dismiss 'because, under the facts and circumstances now disclosed by the record, and compatibly with the act of Congress of the United States to regulate interstate commerce, this court has no power to consider and decide the subject-matters which are complained of, or to award the relief prayed for by plaintiff.' The denial of this motion is assigned as error, and we come at once to consider it, and state only so much of the pleadings and evidence as is necessary to adequately present the issue to be decided.\n The amended petition, after averring that the tie company was a Louisiana corporation and that the railway company was a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, alleged in substance that in 1901 the railway company issued and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission 'its joint through lumber tariff, T. & P. No. 8500-H, applying on lumber, all kinds (except \n\n[234 U.S. 138, 142]\n\u00a0\n walnut and cherry), laths and shingles and articles taking same rates from points on the Texas & Pacific Railway Company to points in Kansas,' by which a joint through rate of 24 cents per 100 pounds was put into effect from points on the railway company's line in Arkansas and Louisiana to Linwood, Kansas, 'on, amongst other things, oak lumber,' which rate, it was averred, had been continuously in effect from the date of the filing of the said tariff up to the happening of the events complained of.\n It was averred that on July 23, 1907, the tie company entered into a contract with the Union Pacific Railway Company to deliver to said company f. o. b. cars Linwood, Kansas, 150,000 oak railway cross-ties of specified dimensions at the rate of 15,000 per month, beginning on or before October 1, 1907, at the price of 86 cents per tie, which contract was by its terms based on the rate of 24 cents per hundred-weight fixed in the tariff filed as above stated in 1901. That, for the purpose of performing said contract, the tie company accumulated at stations on the railway company's line in Arkansas and Louisiana 44,541 oak cross-ties for shipment to Linwood, Kansas, and on October 10, 1907, requested the railway to furnish cars for the loading of the cross-ties at such points. It was alleged that after furnishing three cars, which were loaded by the railway company and shipped at the rate of 24 cents per 100 pounds, the railway company refused to provide further cars, or to receive the cross-ties for shipment, upon the ground, as stated by it, that it had no through rate applicable to oak railway cross-ties from the several points on its line to Linwood, Kansas. The petition charged, however, that the joint through lumber tariff above referred to and the rate of 24 cents thereby established included oak ties, and that the railway's refusal to provide cars and to carry the ties at its published rate was an unjust and unreasonable discrimination against the tie company, against the several places on the railway \n\n[234 U.S. 138, 143]\n\u00a0\n company's line where the ties had been accumulated, and against the ties as an article of commerce, which discrimination, it was averred, was practised by the railway company with the object of preventing the movement of the cross-ties to points beyond its line, and of thus compelling the tie company to sell the ties which it had accumulated to the railway company. It was alleged that the refusal to transport the ties had resulted in unreasonable prejudice and disadvantage to the tie company and to the traffic in ties, and in benefit to the railway company as a purchaser and consumer of cross-ties, all of which constituted a violation of the act to regulate commerce. It was averred that, in consequence of the refusal of the railway to furnish the cars, and the resulting inability of the tie company to deliver the ties to the Union Pacific Railway under the contract, that company had canceled the contract to buy the ties. And the amount sought to be recovered was alleged to be the loss resulting to the tie company consequent on such cancelation, together with punitive damages based on the 'wilful, wanton, and malicious' conduct on the part of the railway company, and a reasonable attorney's fee.\n The railway company, besides denying generally the allegations of the amended petition, alleged that its joint through lumber tariff did not include a rate on oak railway cross-ties, but that cross-ties were a separate and distinct and well-recognized freight commodity, and that at the time mentioned in the petition it had not filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission any tariff under which it could lawfully accept for interstate shipment, at a through rate, the cross-ties offered by the tie company. The answer further denied that its failure to have in effect such a rate was a discrimination against cross-ties or the tie company or any locality, and alleged that oak cross-ties had never before been offered to it in Arkansas and Louisiana for shipment to interstate points on its lines or \n\n[234 U.S. 138, 144]\n\u00a0\n connections so as to render it advisable to establish such a rate. It was averred that when the railway company first learned, in September, 1907, of the purpose of the tie company to ship cross-ties, it at once notified the tie company that it had no through rate on ties, and therefore would not be able to offer such a rate, but would seek to establish a through rate of 50 cents per hundredweight if sufficient time was allowed it to give the public notices of the filing of the tariff as required by the statute. It was then alleged that thereafter the first intimation that the railway company had of the purposes of the tie company was a letter transmitted to one of its officers from the Interstate Commerce Commission, informing the railway company of the fact that the tie company had filed an informal complaint with the Commission on the ground that, although the railway company's tariff on lumber embraced cross-ties, it had announced its intention not to receive them under the lumber schedule, and protesting in advance against permitting the railway company to file a specific tariff on cross-ties at 50 cents per hundredweight, because, as compared with the 24-cent lumber rate, it would be unreasonable. That at once, to avoid difficulty, the railway company applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission to be allowed immediately to put into effect a cross- tie rate at 24 cents per 100 pounds, the same as the lumber rate, and such request was refused by the Commission. Request was then made to put in such a rate after five days' notice, which was likewise refused, and thereupon in January, 1908, the railway company issued and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission a joint through lumber tariff amended so as to include at the lumber rate 'wood railroad cross-ties, all kinds, carloads.' The answer then charged that at no time until such tariff became effective, February 13, 1908, could the railway company have lawfully accepted and carried oak railway cross-ties under the provisions of the \n\n[234 U.S. 138, 145]\n\u00a0\n act to regulate commerce. Referring to an averment in the petition concerning the acceptance of three cars of cross-ties at about this time for shipment at the lumber rate, the answer averred that if the facts were true, it furnished no basis for recovery, as the receipt of the ties inadvertently or otherwise, in the absence of a rate, would have been a violation of law, and afforded no ground for inferring the obligation to continue to do so, and, besides, did not aid the plaintiff's case, which was based upon the refusal of the railway company to take freight at an established and existing rate, not upon any supposed obligation by estoppel to do so when there was no established rate. And by an amendment to the answer it was insisted that under  9 of the act to regulate commerce1 the plaintiff could not prosecute its action because, by making a complaint, as it had done, to the Interstate Commerce Commission, concerning the failure to treat the lumber tariff as embracing a rate on cross-ties, the plaintiff had elected to proceed before the Commission.\n The evidence at the trial tended to support the allegations of the amended petition as to the making of the contract with the Union Pacific Railway Company, the accumulation of cross-ties at the several stations on the railway's line, the request for cars for the shipment of the ties to Linwood, Kansas, the refusal of the railway to provide the cars, the cancelation of the contract by the Union Pacific Railway Company, and the consequent loss to the tie company. The railway company's joint through lumber tariff was introduced in evidence, and it was not disputed that by it a rate of 24 cents per 100 pounds was established on oak lumber, and that oak railway cross-ties were not specifically mentioned. The railway company also introduced in evidence the correspondence between it and the Interstate Commerce Commission, showing, among other things, the request to be allowed to put immediately into effect the cross-tie rate, and the refusal of the \n\n[234 U.S. 138, 146]\n\u00a0\n Commission to grant the request, and the other facts and circumstances stated in the answer. It is not disputable that the pivotal question in the case was whether oak railway cross-ties were included in the filed tariff fixing a through lumber rate of 24 cents per hundredweight, and so far as the solution of that inquiry depended upon the views of men engaged in the lumber and railroad business, as developed in the testimony, it is equally indisputable that there was an irreconcilable conflict. And this conflict at once leads to a consideration of the principle which dominates the controversy, and upon which its decision, therefore, depends.\n There is no room for controversy that the law required a tariff, and therefore, if there was no tariff on cross-ties, the making and filing of such tariff conformably to the statute was essential. And it is equally clear that the controversy as to whether the lumber tariff included cross- ties was one primarily to be determined by the Commission in the exercise of its power concerning tariffs and the authority to regulate conferred upon it by the statute. Indeed, we think it is indisputable that that subject is directly controlled by the authorities which establish that, for the preservation of the uniformity which it was the purpose of the act to regulate commerce to secure, the courts may not, as an original question, exert authority over subjects which primarily come with the jurisdiction of the Commission.

Rep. 916; Morrisdale Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co. \n230 U.S. 304\n, 57 L. ed. 1494, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 938. No question is made as to the controlling effect of the doctrine as a general rule, but it is urged that it is not applicable to this case for the following reasons:\n\n\n (a)\n The foundation upon which the doctrine rests, it is \n\n[234 U.S. 138, 147]\n\u00a0\n insisted, is the necessity of a uniform enforcement of the interstate commerce act and the danger of diversity and conflict arising if questions concerning the existence of tariffs or their reasonableness, of discriminations and preferences, were left to be originally determined by courts of general jurisdiction, thus giving rise to the possibility of one rule in one jurisdiction and another in another. But the argument proceeds to insist that upon the principle that where the reason for the application of a law ceases to exist the law itself ceases to apply, the settled construction of the act to regulate commerce, announced and enforced in the Abilene and other cases, has here no application because it is so plain that oak cross-ties were included in the lumber rate as fixed in the tariff of the railway company that there is no reason for proceeding primarily before the Commission, as there is no possibility of difference on the subject if left to the consideration of the courts. We need not pause to point out the palpable error of law which the proposition involves, since, on the face of the record, it is apparent that the assumption of fact upon which it rests is absolutely without foundation. We say this because nothing could more clearly demonstrate such result than does the conflict and confusion in the testimony concerning whether cross-ties were included in the filed lumber tariff. And indeed, the same demonstration arises from a consideration of some decided cases; as, for instance, American Tie & Timber Co. v. Kansas City Southern R. Co. 99 C. C. A. 44, 175 Fed. 28, 33, presumably a report of this case, where it appears that at the first hearing the trial judge was so clearly of the opinion that cross-ties were not lumber that he so charged the jury, and directed a verdict for the railroad company. See also Greason v. St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. 112 Mo. App. 116, 86 S. W. 722, where it is apparent that the same conclusion was reached.\n\n\n (b)\n Because the question has been determined by the Interstate Commerce Commission in Reynolds v. Western New York & P. R. \n\n[234 U.S. 138, 148]\n\u00a0\n Co. 1 I. C. C. Rep. 393, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 685. An examination of that report, however, discloses that the railway had in effect a published rate on cross-ties eo nomine, and the complaint was that it was unreasonable because it was higher than the rate on lumber. The ruling of the Commission was not that the lumber rate included a rate on ties, but that the rate on ties was unreasonable as compared with the lumber rate, and should be reduced.\n\n\n (c)\n Because the railway company, by loading and carrying the three cars of ties under the 24-cent rate, had itself recognized the applicability of the lumber rate to cross-ties, and was concluded thereby. But, without stopping to consider the tendency of the proof establishing the want of foundation for the proposition, we think it is wanting in merit for this obvious reason: If, as we have seen, the question of whether cross-ties were embraced in the filed tariff concerning lumber was involved in such conflict and doubt as to require the action of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the situation was such that the railway company could not do by indirection that which the statute permitted it to do only by compliance with the law; that is, filing its tariffs in the regular way. Nothing could better serve to demonstrate this self-evident truth than by recurring to the fact that, at the very inception of the controversy the request made by the railway company to the Interstate Commerce Commission to be allowed to immediately put in the rate on cross- ties was refused by that body.\n\n\n (d)\n Because the railway company did not refuse to transport the ties in good faith, and insisted upon the absence of a scheduled rate simply as a pretext and device for preventing the shipment of the ties and their delivery in performance of the contract with the Union Pacific Railway, and with the ulterior and wrongful motive of keeping the ties on its line, so as to be able to purchase them itself from the tie company. But without pausing \n\n[234 U.S. 138, 149]\n\u00a0\n to do more than direct attention to the fact that this proposition is necessarily disposed of by what we have said, that is, by the lawfulness, in view of the state of the existing and filed tariff, of the refusal until the Commission had acted, we think all the contentions under this last head are completely answered by the statement that the suit was based upon the unlawfulness of the action of the railway company in refusing to carry the ties in view of the filed tariffs, and therefore the contentions are not open for our consideration.\n It results that error was committed by the court in declining to sustain the motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, and therefore it is our duty to reverse.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice Pitney dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 382 (U.

Rep. 601.\n The circuit court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the district court, rendered upon a verdict, against the railway company for the value of cotton destroyed by fire alleged to have started from sparks and cinders negligently permitted to escape from some passing locomotive. The answer of the company denied all negligence, and expressly set up: (1) That it exercised ordinary care to procure and use upon all of its engines proper spark arresters, and that these were in good repair when the accident occurred. (2) That, without its consent, the cotton was stored on the part of an open platform which \n\n[235 U.S. 429, 431]\n\u00a0\n extended over its right of way, and was thus voluntarily exposed near tracks along which twenty engines were operated every day.\n While insisting that sparks or cinders from only three identified engines could have caused the fire, the railway company nevertheless introduced some evidence tending to show that all locomotives were properly equipped. In rebuttal, and over objection, a witness was permitted to testify that within a few days after the accident he saw engines, while passing near the scene, emit large cinders; and the admission of such evidence constitutes the principal subject of complaint here. In view of the pleadings and the statements of preceding witnesses, this action was not improper. Texas & P. R. Co. v. Watson, \n190 \nU.S. 287, 289\n, 47 S. L. ed. 1057, 1059, 25 Sup. Ct.

This refusal is said to constitute plain and material error; but we think otherwise, in view of the long-continued use of the platform, and the clear instruction in respect of contributory negligence.

That no mark by which the goods of the owner of the mark may be distinguished from other goods of the same class shall be refused registration as a trademark on account of the nature of such mark unless such mark--\n\n'(a) Consists of or comprises immoral or scandalous matter;\n\n'(b) Consists of or comprises the flag or coat of arms or \n\n[233 U.S. 461, 465]\n\u00a0\n other insignia of the United States, or any simulation thereof, or of any state or municipality, or of any foreign nation: Provided, That trademarks which are identical with a registered or known trademark owned and in use by another, and appropriated to merchandise of the same descriptive properties, or which so nearly resemble a registered or known trademark owned and in use by another, and appropriated to merchandise of the same descriptive properties, as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public, or to deceive purchasers, shall not be registered: Provided, That no mark which consists merely in the name of an individual, firm, corporation, or association, not written, printed, impressed, or woven in some particular or distinctive manner or in association with a portrait of the individual, or merely in words or devices which are descriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods, or merely a geographical name or term, shall be registered under the terms of this act: Provided further, That no portrait of a living individual may be registered as a trademark, except by the Consent of such individual, evidenced by an Instrument in writing: And provided further, That nothing herein shall prevent the registration of any mark used by the applicant or his predecessors, or by those from whom title to the mark is derived, in commerce with foreign nations or among the several states, or with Indian tribes, which was in actual and exclusive use as a trademark of the applicant or his predecessors from whom he derived title for ten years next preceding the passage of this act.'\n\n The fourth proviso, or ten-year clause, has manifest reference to marks which are not technical trademarks; otherwise, it would have no effect. The owner of a trademark valid at common law and used in commerce with foreign nations, or among the several states, or with Indian tribes, may obtain its registration under the act \n\n[233 U.S. 461, 466]\n\u00a0\n without showing the user of ten years required by this clause. Secs. 1, 2. Congress evidently had in mind the fact that marks, although not susceptible of exclusive appropriation at common law, frequently acquired a special significance in connection with particular commodities; and the language of the fourth proviso was carefully chosen in order to bring within the statute those marks which, while not being technical trademarks, had been in 'actual and exclusive use' as trademarks for ten years next preceding the passage of the act. \n2\n See \n\n[233 U.S. 461, 467]\n\u00a0\n Re Cahn, 27 App. D. C. 173, 177; Worster Brewing Corp. v. Rueter, 30 App. D. C. 428, 430, 431; Re Wright, 33 App. D. C. 510.\n It is suggested, however, that the privilege accorded by this proviso is limited to marks which lie outside the positive prohibitions contained in the earlier clauses of  5. Thus, it is said that the exceptions with respect to marks of a scandalous sort, and as to those embracing public insignia, are plainly intended to apply to all marks of the described character, whether or not they had been used for the preceding ten years ( Re Cahn, supra); and it is urged that if this be so, the prohibitions of the provisos which precede the ten-year clause must likewise be deemed to restrict its scope. The emphasis in the present case is placed upon the second proviso in  5. This, in substance, prohibits the registration of marks consisting merely of individual, firm, or corporate names, not written or printed in a distinctive manner, or of designations descriptive of the character or quality of the goods with which they are used, or of geographical names or terms; and it thus contains, as the court of appeals said, 'a fairly complete list' of the marks used by dealers in selling their goods, which are not valid trademarks at common law. If the ten-year proviso be construed as not to apply to any marks within this comprehensive description, the clause would have little or nothing to act upon, and we can conceive of no reason for its insertion.\n We think that the intent of Congress is clear. In the opening clause of  5, it is provided that no mark by which the goods of the owner may be distinguished from other goods of the same class shall be refused registration as a trademark, on account of its nature, unless it consists of, or comprises: (a) immoral or scandalous matter; or (b) certain public insignia. The marks within these excepted classes are withdrawn from the purview of the act. Then, \n\n[233 U.S. 461, 468]\n\u00a0\n in dealing with the marks which remain, limitations upon registrability are defined by the first, second, and third provisos; and the restrictions thus imposed are in turn qualified by the fourth proviso or ten-year clause. It follows that the fourth proviso in no way detracts from the force of the exceptions contained in clauses (a) and (b) which were plainly intended to be established without qualification; but the generality of the succeeding prohibitions is qualified. It may well be that this qualification, by reason of its terms, does not affect the first proviso, which relates to cases of conflicting trademarks, as the ten-year clause explicitly requires that the use shall have been 'exclusive.' But there can be no doubt that this clause does modify the general limitations contained in the second proviso with respect to the use of marks consisting of names of persons, firms, or corporations, of terms descriptive of character and quality, or of geographical names or terms. Marks of this sort, notwithstanding the general prohibition, were made registrable when the applicant or his predecessors had used them, actually and exclusively, as trademarks for the described period.\n In this view, the complainant was entitled to register its mark. We need not stop to discuss the contention that the complainant's use had not been exclusive, or that the mark had not been used in interstate commerce, or the further defense that the complainant should be denied relief because it had deceived the public. It is enough to say that these contentions were without adequate support in the evidence and were properly overruled by the circuit court.\n Having the right to register its mark, the complainant was entitled to its protection as a valid trademark under the statute. As defined in  29, 'the term 'trademark' includes any mark which is entitled to registration under the terms of this act.' The defendants, \n\n[233 U.S. 461, 469]\n\u00a0\n however, insisted below, and urge here, that although the mark was registrable, it was not susceptible of ownership, and hence that the complainant could not maintain a suit for injunction, profits, and damages, as provided in the statute, for the reason that the remedies it affords are available only to 'owners' ( 16, 19). That is to say, that registration was expressly permitted, but that protection to the registrant was denied. This interpretation, of course, would render the ten-year proviso meaningless by stripping it of practical effect. It was not the intention of Congress thus to provide for a barren notice of an ineffectual claim, but to confer definite rights. The applicant who, by virtue of actual and exclusive use, is entitled to register his mark under this clause, becomes on due registration the 'owner' of a 'trademark' within the meaning of the act, and he is entitled to be protected in its use as such.\n The further argument is made that, assuming that the complainant has a valid registered trademark, still the protection is limited to its use when standing alone (as the complainant has used it on its labels), and that there can be no infringement unless it is used in this precise manner. The statutory right cannot be so narrowly limited. Not only exact reproduction, but a 'colorable imitation' is within the statute; otherwise, the trademark would be of little avail, as by shrewd simulation it could be appropriated with impunity. The act provides ( 16): 'Any person who shall, without the consent of the owner thereof, reproduce, counterfeit, copy, or colorably imitate any such trademark . . . and shall use, or shall have used, such reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation in commerce among the several states . . . shall be liable. . . .' This provision applies to all trademarks that are within the act, including those which come under the ten-year clause, provided they are not used 'in unlawful business,' or 'upon any article injurious in itself,' or \n\n[233 U.S. 461, 470]\n\u00a0\n 'with the design of deceiving the public,' and have not been 'abandoned' ( 21).\n But, while this is true, the inquiry as to the extent of the right thus secured by the statute, in the case of marks which are admitted to registration under the ten-year clause, is not completely answered. It is apparent that, with respect to names or terms coming within this class, there may be proper uses by others than the registrant, even in connection with trade in similar goods. It would seem to be clear, for example, that the registration for which the statute provides was not designed to confer a monopoly of the use of surnames, or of geographical names, as such. It is not to be supposed that Congress intended to prevent one from using his own name in trade, or from making appropriate reference to the town or city in which his place of business is located; and we do not find it necessary to consider the question of the validity of such an attempt if one were made. Congress has admitted to registration the names or terms belonging to the class under consideration simply because of their prior use as trademarks, although they had not been such in law. Their exclusive use as trademarks for the stated period was deemed, in the judgment of Congress, a sufficient assurance that they had acquired a secondary meaning as the designation of the origin or ownership of the merchandise to which they were affixed. And it was manifestly in this limited character only that they received statutory recognition, and, on registration, became entitled to protection under the act.\n In the case, therefore, of marks consisting of names or terms having a double significance, and being susceptible of legitimate uses with respect to their primary sense, the reproduction, copy, or imitation which constitutes infringement must be such as is calculated to mislead the public with respect to the origin or ownership of the goods, and thus to invade the right of the registrant to the use \n\n[233 U.S. 461, 471]\n\u00a0\n of the name or term as a designation of his merchandise. This we conceive to be the meaning of the statute. It follows that where the mark consists of a surname, a person having the same name and using it in his own business, although dealing in similar goods, would not be an infringer, provided that the name was not used in a manner tending to mislead, and it was clearly made to appear that the goods were his own, and not those of the registrant. This is not to say that, in this view, the case becomes one simply of unfair competition, as that category has been defined in the law; for, whatever analogy may exist with respect to the scope of protection in this class of cases, still the right to be protected against an unwarranted use of the registered mark has been made a statutory right, and the courts of the United States have been vested with jurisdiction of suits for infringement, regardless of diversity of citizenship. Moreover, in view of this statutory right, it could not be considered necessary that the complainant, in order to establish infringement, should show wrongful intent in fact on the part of the defendant, or facts justifying the inference of such an intent. Lawrence Mfg. Co. v. Tennessee Mfg. Co. \n138 \nU.S. 537, 549\n, 34 S. L. ed. 997, 1004, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 396; Singer Mfg. Co. v. June Mfg. Co. \n163 U.S. 169\n, 41 L. ed. 118, 16 Sup. Ct.

Having duly registered under the act, the complainant would be entitled to protection against any infringing use; but, in determining the extent of the right which the statute secures, and what may be said to constitute an infringing use, regard must be had, as has been said, to the nature of the mark, and its secondary, as distinguished from its primary, significance.\n The distinction between permissible and prohibited uses may be a difficult one to draw in particular cases, but it must be drawn in order to give effect to the act of Congress. That the distinction may readily be observed in practice is apparent. In this case, for instance, if the de- \n\n[233 U.S. 461, 472]\n\u00a0\n fendants had so chosen, they could have adopted a distinct mark of their own, which would have served to designate their inks and completely to distinguish them from those of the complainant. It was not necessary that, in exercising the right to use their own name in trade, they should imitate the mark which the complainant used, and was entitled to use under the statute, as a designation of its wares; or that they should use the name in question upon their labels without ummistakably differentiating their goods from those which the complainant manufactured and sold.\n We agree with the circuit court that infringement was shown. The complainant put its mark 'DAVIDS\" prominently at the top of its labels. The defendants, in the same position on its labels, put 'C. I. DAVIDS.\" At the bottom of their labels the defendants placed 'DAVIDS MFG. CO.' The use of the name in this manner was a mere simulation of the complainant's mark which it had duly registered; it constituted a 'colorable imitation' within the meaning of the act. The decree of the circuit court accordingly restrained the defendants from the use of the words 'Davids Manufacturing Company,' and from the use of the word 'Davids' at the top of their labels in connection with the business of making and selling inks. We think that the complainant was entitled to this measure of protection.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must therefore be reversed and that of the Circuit Court affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 5 has been amended by the acts of March 2, 1907, chap. 2573, 34 Stat. at L. 1251, February 18, 1911, chap. 113, 36 Stat. at L. 918, U.

The bill was amended in the Senate so as to substitute the word 'mark' for the word 'trademark,' where it is italicised above, and also by striking out the words 'and lawful.' The conference committee recommended that the House recede from its disagreement to these amendments and that the words 'and exclusive' should be substituted for the words 'and lawful.' The managers on the part of the House made the following statement in explanation:\n'On amendments Nos. 2 and 3: The word 'mark' is substituted in each instance for the word 'trademark' in the bill as it passed the House, for the reason that the use of the word 'trademark' in this connection would not have accomplished the purposes of the proviso of the section in question.\n\n'On amendment No. 4: The words 'and lawful' were stricken out by the Senate amendment, and by the conference report it is recommended that the words 'and exclusive' be substituted therefor. The purpose of this amendment is to prohibit the registration of any marks which are not technical trademarks unless the applicant has used such mark exclusively for the period of ten years. The words 'next preceding' are inserted in place of the words 'prior to' the passage of the act, so as to require the exclusive use of the mark for the ten years immediately preceding the passage of this act.'

Rounds and Harold Otis for respondent.\n\n\n[232 U.S. 221, 232]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit by a citizen of California, the holder of two notes made in California by the Wentworth Hotel Company, to recover from a stockholder in that corporation, a citizen of New York, a proportionate share of the sums due upon the same. The facts as agreed and found are as follows: The corporation was formed under the laws of the territory of Arizona, among many other things, to buy and sell real estate, 'to build, maintain, operate, and carry on, in all its branches, the business of hotel keeping,' and to build or purchase gas or electric works in Arizona or California, 'both for its use in the hotel business and for the purpose of selling and disposing of the same.' The principal place of business in Arizona was Tucson, and that outside of it was Los Angeles, California, with power to change to Pasadena, in that state. Before the incorporation, the defendant, re- \n\n[232 U.S. 221, 233]\n\u00a0\n siding in New York, signed a writing reciting the intent of the subscribers to form a corporation in Arizona for the purpose of acquiring a portion of the Oak Knoll, and building a first-class hotel thereon; and he thereby subscribed for a certain number of shares. Later he took and paid for one thousand shares. The Oak Knoll is near Pasadena, in California, and the defendant and his associates intended the corporation to have the power to build and manage a hotel in that neighborhood, and expected that it would do so, but intended their liability to be controlled by the laws of Arizona.\n The corporation complied with the laws of California, bought the land, built the hotel, went into business, and finally was adjudged insolvent. The notes in question were given for loans to the company. At the time of subscribing the defendant agreed with the company that he should be exempt from personal liability, and that neither the corporation nor its officers should have power to subject him or the other stockholders to it. Such exemption was expressed also in the certificate of incorporation. But by the statutes of California each stockholder of a corporation is personally liable for such proportion of the debts contracted while he is such, as the amount of his stock bears to the whole subscribed, and the liability of each stockholder of a corporation formed under the laws of any other state or territory of the United States, but doing business in California, is the same. Civil Code,  322. The courts below ruled that the defendant could not be held, the circuit court of appeals citing Risdon Iron & Locomotive Works v. Furness \n\n[232 U.S. 221, 1906]\n\u00a0\n 1 K. B. 49, 75 L. J. K. B. N. S. 83, 54 Week. Rep. 324, 93 L. T. N. S. 687, 22 Times L. R. 45, 11 Com. Cas. 35, in which it was held that the law of California could not impose liability upon an English shareholder in an English corporation, without his assent. 113 C. C. A. 101, 192 Fed. 495.\n We agree that without authority from the stockholder a corporation cannot make him answerable in a way not \n\n[232 U.S. 221, 234]\n\u00a0\n contemplated by the charter. We will assume for purposes of decision, although we express no opinion upon the point, that a provision for doing business in other states without any express reference to the possible difference in their laws would not be enough to change the rule. But a provision exempting the stockholder alongside of one authorizing the doing of business elsewhere cannot be taken to limit the latter authority to those states that grant a like exemption, or be deemed an attempt to override the law of the place where the business is to be done. That law may fail to operate for want of power over the person sought to be affected; but the charter leaves it open to that person to come in under it by assent. If the law of California forbade a foreign corporation to do business there unless all the stockholders filed a written assent to its conditions, the Arizona charter would not make such an agreement void. If this be true, then a particular stockholder may give such assent outside of the instrument of incorporation, and be bound by it.\n In this case the defendant expressed in writing his wish the corporation should set up a hotel in California. It is true that he also desired and stipulated that he should be free from personal charge. But that is merely the not infrequent occurrence of a party bringing about the facts and attempting to prohibit their legal consequence to which we lately had occasion to advert in National City Bank v. Hotchkiss, \n231 \nU.S. 50, 56\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 20. See also Butler v. Farnsworth, 4 Wash C.C. 101, 103, 104, Fed. Cas. No. 2,240. This, of course, he cannot do. In such cases the only question is which of two inconsistent orders is the dominant command. Here the usual prevalence of the specific over the general is fortified by the consideration that the building and carrying on of the California hotel was the main object for which the parties came together. When the defendant authorized that, he could not avoid the consequences by saying that he did not foresee or intend, or that he forbade \n\n[232 U.S. 221, 235]\n\u00a0\n them. He knew that California had laws, and he took his risk of what they might be, when, as we must hold, he gave his assent to doing business there. We cannot interpret his words as giving merely a conditional assent. We follow the language of Pinney v. Nelson, \n183 U.S. 144\n, 46 L. ed. 125, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 52, so far as it sanctions the views that we have expressed. See also Thomas v. Wentworth Hotel Co. 158 Cal. 275, 280, 139 Am. St. Rep. 120, 110 Pac. 942.\n There remains only the question whether the liability is of a kind that will be enforced outside of the California courts. Analysis on this point often is blurred by the vague statement that the liability is 'contractual.' An obligation to pay money generally is enforced by an action of assumpsit, and to that extent is referred to a contract, even though it be one existing only by fiction of law. But such obligations when imposed upon the members of a corporation may very very largely. The incorporation may create a chartered partnership the members of which are primary contractors, or it may go no farther than to impose a penalty; or again, it may create a secondary remedy for a debt treated as that of the corporation alone, like the right to attach the corporation's real estate; or the liability may be inseparable from the local procedure; or the law may be so ambiguous as to leave it doubtful whether the liability is matter of remedy, and local, or creates a contract on the part of the members that will go with them wherever they are found. McClaine v. Rankin, \n197 U.S. 154\n, 161 49 L. ed. 702, 705, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 410, 3 Ann. Cas. 500; Christopher v. Norvell, \n201 \nU.S. 216, 225\n, 226 S., 50 L. ed. 732, 736, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 502, 5 Ann. Cas. 740. In the present case we think that there can be no doubt of the meaning of the California statute. It reads: 'Each stockholder of a corporation is individually and personally liable for such proportion of its debts and liabilities,' etc., as we have stated, and supposes the action against him to be brought 'upon such debt.' Civil Code,  322. This means that by force of the statute, if the corporation incurs a debt within the juris- \n\n[232 U.S. 221, 236]\n\u00a0\n diction, the stockholder is a party to it, and joins in the contract in the proportion of his shares. And while the statutes of California cannot force an agent upon a foreign principal, still, if he has created such an agency in advance, he has come within the jurisdiction by his agent, as in other cases of contract made within a state from outside, and will be bound.

S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 758), to recover from the United States and the Ute Indians the value of certain personal property alleged to have belonged to appellant's intestate, and to have been taken and destroyed by members of the Ute tribe in 1857. It was also alleged that the claim had been presented to, and was pending before, the House of Representatives in 1877 and 1878. The allegations of the petition were traversed, and a trial resulted in a judgment of dismissal for want of jurisdiction, upon the ground that the claim accrued before July 1, 1865, and had not been presented to Congress, or any officer authorized to inquire into such claims, prior to the act of 1891, and so was not cognizable under that act.\n The facts disclosed in the findings, and material to be noticed, are these: The depredation occurred at Mountain Meadows, Utah, September 11, 1857, while the appellant's intestate was en route, with an emigrant train, from Arkansas to California, his life being taken at the time. In 1877 and again in 1878 one of his daughters, on behalf of his heirs, presented to Congress a petition praying that they be reimbursed for the property from the public treasury. The petitions, as also the accompanying affidavits, represented that the depredation was committed by Mormons acting under the direction of Brigham Young, and contained no suggestion that it was in anywise chargeable to the Ute Indians or to any Indians. In response to each of the petitions a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives, reciting that the depredation was com- \n\n[232 U.S. 469, 476]\n\u00a0\n mitted by Mormons at the instance of Brigham Young, and making an appropriation to reimburse the heirs as prayed in the petition, but neither bill was passed, and the claim was not otherwise recognized by Congress. In no other way or form was the claim presented to or pending before any department of the government, or any of its officers or agents, prior to the passage of the act of 1891\n\n\n Preliminarily, it is well to observe that the court of claims has no general jurisdiction over claims against the United States, and can take cognizance only of those which, by the terms of some act of Congress, are committed to it. Johnson v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 546, 549\n, 40 S. L. ed. 529, 531, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 377.\n Turning to the act of 1891 we find that it is not couched in general terms, but, on the contrary, carefully specifies what claims may be considered, and as carefully points out some which it is intended shall not be considered. It is entitled, 'An act to Provide for the Adjudication and Payment of Claims Arising from Indian Depredations.' Its 1st section empowers the court to inquire into and adjudicate, among others not material here, 'all claims for property of citizens of the United States, taken or destroyed by Indians belonging to any band, tribe, or nation in amity with the United States, without just cause or provocation on the part of the owner or agent in charge, and not returned or paid for.' And the 2d section declares:\n'That all questions of limitations as to time and manner of presenting claims are hereby waived, and no claim shall be excluded from the jurisdiction of the court because not heretofore presented to the Secretary of the Interior or other officer or department of the government: Provided, That no claim accruing prior to July first, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, shall be considered by the court unless the claim shall be allowed or has been or is pending, prior to the passage of this act, before the Secretary of the Interior or the Congress of the United \n\n[232 U.S. 469, 477]\n\u00a0\n States, or before any superintendent, agent, subagent, or commissioner, authorized under any act of Congress to inquire into such claims; but no case shall be considered pending unless evidence has been presented therein: . . .'\n\n Assuming, without so deciding, that the clause quoted from the first section, if not otherwise restrained, is broad enough to embrace the present claim, notwithstanding some of its particulars not here noticed, we come to consider whether it is within the restrictive clause in the 2d section, declaring that no claim accruing prior to July 1, 1865, shall be considered unless it was allowed or was pending prior to the passage of the act. To a better understanding of this clause and the preceding one in the same section it is well to recall that there was an existing limitation of time upon the prosecution of claims against the government ( Rev. Stat.  1069, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 740, and that there had been and were then various statutory and treaty provisions regulating the manner of presenting claims for Indian depredations, by whom they were to be examined, and the evidence required to sustain them. 4 Stat. at L. 731, chap. 161,  17; 11 Stat. at L. 401, chap. 66,  8; 12 Stat. at L. 120, Res.

Both clauses must be read in the light of those limitations and provisions, and when this is done, it is apparent that Congress, while disposed to be very liberal inwaiving prior restrictions upon the time and mode of presenting such claims, deemed it unwise to open the door so wide in respect of claims accruing prior to July 1, 1865, and therefore declared that the court should not consider them, save where they had been allowed or had been pending prior to the passage of the act.\n The present claim accrued in 1857, was never allowed, and was not a pending claim before the date of the act; \n\n[232 U.S. 469, 478]\n\u00a0\n unless it can be said that it was pending before Congress in 1877 and 1878. We think this cannot properly be said. The claim to which the attention of Congress was invited in those years was not for an act of depredation by Indians, but, as was stated in the petitions and accompanying affidavits and in the bills introduced in response thereto, was for a depredation by Mormons. No one could understand from the petitions and affidavits or from the bills that there was any purpose to claim indemnity from the government on the ground that the depredation was committed by its Indian wards, or to obtain reparation from the latter through the exertion of the government's control over them. Rightly speaking, it was merely an appeal to the bounty or generosity of Congress, and probably was so regarded by the latter. At all events it was not an assertion or presentation of the claim which is the subject of this suit, for the latter is for an act of depredation by Indians, not by Mormons. We are accordingly of opinion that the claim is one jurisdiction of which is expressly withheld from the Court of Claims by the act of 1891.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","229":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTINKER v. MIDLAND VALLEY MERCANTILE CO.(1914)\nNo. 13\nArgued: Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles H. Merillat for plaintiff in error\n No appearance for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an action on a promissory note for $922.50, dated September 1, 1906, against an Osage Indian residing on \n\n[231 U.S. 681, 682]\n\u00a0\n the Osage Reservation. By the Indian appropriation act of June 21, 1906, chap. 3504, 34 Stat. at L. 325, 366, it was made 'unlawful hereafter for the traders upon the Osage Indian Reservation to give credit to any individual Indian, head of a family, to an amount greater than seventy- five per centum of the next quarterly annuity to which such Indian will be entitled.' This amended the previous act of March 3, 1901, chap. 832, 31 Stat. at L. 1058, 1065, by which the limit was 60 per centum. The defendant demurred, and the demurrer having been overruled, answered that the note was given for a debt in excess of 57 per cent of the next quarterly annuity due to him after the credit was extended, and that the note exceeded that amount. It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff, the defendant in error, was a licensed trader with the Indians, and the defendant testified that he received as his quarterly payment $46 for each of the seven members of his family, which would be $322,-in any event, much less than $922.50. It was not shown when the credits were given. The plaintiff demurred to the evidence, and the demurrer was sustained by both courts below. 25 Okla. 160, 105 Pac. 333.\n The supreme court of the state put its decision on the burden of proof, following the analogy of illegal consideration. We hardly need consider whether proof that the note was so largely in excess of the percentage then allowable, especially when coupled with the improbability that the defendant ever had received in the past an annuity so much larger as to warrant such a credit, did not constitute at least a prima facie case. The court is of opinion that, in view of the policy of the statute, the relative position of the parties, and the protection necessarily extended to Indians, the burden was on the plaintiff not only to bring his claim within the permission of the statute in fact, as he was warned by its letter that he must, but also to prove that he had done so, in case of dispute. He occu- \n\n[231 U.S. 681, 683]\n\u00a0\n pied the position of advantage, and that, rather than formal logic, determines the burden of proof. It may be that it lay on the defendant to plead the defense. That is a question of convenience. Burnet v. Desmornes y Alvarez, \n226 \nU.S. 145, 147\n, 57 S. L. ed. 159, 160, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 63. But the order of pleading does not always determine the burden of proof. Generally it is not considered necessary for the payee of a promissory note to allege a consideration in declaring upon it, but if there is conflicting evidence, he has the burden of proof. Delano v. Bartlett, 6 Cush. 364; Burnham v. Allen, 1 Gray, 496.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","230":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTRIMBLE v.

Corliss and George McKay for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n\n[231 U.S. 683, 687]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Howard A. Hanson, William B. Allison, and James E. Bradford for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is an attempt to reverse a judgment confirming an assessment on certain leaseholds of tide lands. The leases were executed by the state in 1899. Subsequent statutes of 1905 and 1907, respectively, authorized the assessment of such leaseholds for local improvements specially benefiting them, and the inclusion of them within local improvement districts by cities of the first class. The city of Seattle made a plank roadway, created an improvement district, levied an assessment which failed (Coast Land Co. v. Seattle, 52 Wash. 380, 100 Pac. 856), and then in due form levied the reassessment that is in question here. The plaintiffs in error argue that the leases contained an implied covenant for quiet enjoyment, and that the subsequent laws that authorized the assessment impair their constitutional rights. Art. 1,  10, 14th Amend.  1. The supreme court of Washington, admitting the general rule as to leases, held that, so far as concerns taxation, it did not apply to leases made by the state. 64 Wash. 102, 116 Pac. 647.\n The concession of the court was that in private contracts, 'in the absence of a covenant or condition to the contrary, it is an implied covenant in every lease that the lessor shall pay all taxes and assessments levied on the leased land during the term.' Stated in this form, the rule appears to be a rule of policy to which special considerations may set a limit. But it might be suggested that if the state should expressly covenant against such \n\n[231 U.S. 683, 688]\n\u00a0\n assessments, it could not impair the obligation of its contract by a subsequent law. The words used in these leases are 'lease, demise, and let:' and from Spencer's Case, 5 Coke, 16a, 17a, 1 Smith, Lead. Cas. 52, 15 Eng. Rul. Cas. 233, down to the present day, these words have been said to imply A COVENANT. 1 WMS. SAUND. 322, NOTE 2; mostyn v. west mosTyn cOal & i. co. l. R. 1 C. P. Div. 145, 152, 45 L. J. C. P. N.

Words express whatever meaning convention has attached to them; and so it may be argued that the state has covenanted against this tax in express terms.\n Nevertheless it is obvious that the supposed meaning was not reached by simple interpretation. There is no suggestion of warranty in dedi or demisi by any usage of speech alone. The warranty was what Lord Coke called a warranty in law (2 Co. Litt. 384a),-an institution, not depending upon an expression of intent, not arising because the words mean warrant, but imposed from without by the law. In Butler's note to this page the lessor's obligation is put as reciprocal to the tenant's obligation to pay rent (compare 5 Coke, 17a), just as the warranty in dedi in some cases was a consequence of tenure. One may wonder whether in fact the warranty incident to a sele in early law before the machinery of implied contracts was thought of (Glanv. VII., chap. 2; X., chap. 15; Lex. Sal. chap. 47; 1 L oning, Vertragsbruch, 103; 2 Co. Inst. 274, 275) was not given a scholastic turn, extended, limited, and embodied in sacremental words,- whether Glanville's donatores, grantors, did not suggest the special effect of dedi in the Statute de Bigamis, as interpreted by Lord Coke. ( The statute itself says that the feoffor is held ratione doni proprii. 4 Edw. I., chap. 6.) But whatever may be the history, it is plain, as we have said, that the rule is not the result of interpretation, but of doctrine; and hence it is that very commonly the rule is stated as expressing the general operation of a lease, and not as depending upon the use of a particular word. 64 Wash. 102, 104, 116 Pac. 647; J. W. Perry \n\n[231 U.S. 683, 689]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Norfolk, \n220 \nU.S. 472, 477\n, 55 S. L. ed. 548, 550, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 465; Duncklee v. Webber, 151 Mass. 408, 411, 24 N. E. 1082; and cases cited in 24 Cyc. 1057; 18 Am. & Eng. Enc. Law, 2d ed. 650. It has come back to what it started as being,-a construction of the law; and since, notwithstanding its age, the special effect of demisi has not entered into speech so far as to reach popular understanding, the rule still may be construed as extending no further than reason dictates. Indeed, warranties in law always have been dealt with on this principle. See e. g., Brett v. Cumberland, Cro. Jac. 521, 523. Therefore we may consider the question before us on the footing upon which it was discussed by the supreme court of the state.\n The question is, then, whether our duty requires us to overthrow a decision that the policy of the state law excludes a constructive obligation to indemnify against the exercise of the sovereign power of taxation from leases by the state. Put in this form, it is not hard to answer. When the law creates an obligation outside of the expressed intent of the parties, it must consider all the circumstances, and the effect with reference to them. In ordinary cases the whole property is taxed, and which party shall bear the burden is not a matter of public concern. But when the state makes the lease, the supposed obligation would be an obligation not to tax,-a restriction of public import not lightly to be imposed. Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514, 561, 7 L. ed. 939, 955; Wells v. Savannah, \n181 \nU.S. 531, 539\n, 540 S., 45 L. ed. 986, 991, 992, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 697; St. Louis v. United R. Co. \n210 \nU.S. 266, 273\n, 274 S., 52 L. ed. 1054, 1057, 1058, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 630. J. W. Perry Co. v. Norfolk, \n220 \nU.S. 472, 480\n, 55 S. L. ed. 548, 551, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 465. It is urged that to deny the state's obligation discriminates unconstitutionally against this class of lessees, since all others are free from the burden. But that is not true. Whether landlord or tenant shall pay a tax is a matter of private arrangement, and the practice one way or the other has no bearing on the matter. The argument from inequality really works the other way. If these leaseholds are not \n\n[231 U.S. 683, 690]\n\u00a0\n taxable, they are a favored class of property; for ordinarily leaseholds are taxed even if they are lumped and included in the value of the fee. When an interest in land, whether freehold or for years, is severed from the public domain and put into private hands, the natural implication is that it goes there with the ordinary incidents of private property, and therefore is subject to being taxed. See New York ex rel. Metropolitan Street R. Co. v. New York State Tax Comrs. \n199 \nU.S. 1, 38\n, 50 S. L. ed. 65, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 705, 4 Ann. Cas. 381.\n The plaintiffs in error think that thus far there has been a failure to understand their contention that these assessments are against the land, and therefore are met by the supposed contract of the state, that the lessees should have the land free of all charges. The court below appears to us to have decided in direct response to that argument that the contract of the state did not go so far, and we are of opinion that we ought not to pronounce the decision wrong. There was some subsidiary discussion of the meaning and operation of the statutes, but upon those matters we do not go behind the judgment of the supreme court of the state.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","231":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S EX REL BROWN v. LANE(1914)\n\nArgued: Decided: March 9, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. Andrew Wilson, Albert L. Wilson, and James P. Schick for petitioner.\n No appearance for Franklin K. Lane. \n\n[232 U.S. 598, 599]\n\u00a0\n\n Memorandum opinion by direction of the court. By Mr. Chief Justice white:\n The act of June 28, 1906, entitled, An Act for 'the Division of the Lands and Funds of the Osage Indians in Oklahoma Territory, and for Other Purposes,' in its 9th section provided, among other things, for a tribal council composed of eight persons. The members of this council were to be chosen at an election whose date was fixed, and which was to be conducted in the manner directed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, provision being made for the biennial recurrence of such election, and consequently for a two years' term for the members of the council. The provision, however, creating the council, contained this express qualification: 'And the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized to remove from the council any member or members thereof for good cause, to be by him determined.' 34 Stat. at L. 545, chap. 3572. On January 2d, 1913, the Secretary of the Interior, in the exertion of the power thus conferred, by a formal order removed 'each and every member of the council.' It was declared in the order that the power exercised was exerted for good cause, and this statement was followed by a specification of various acts of misfeasance or nonfeasance, which it was deemed rendered the removal necessary. Among those who were thus removed was A. H. Brown, the relator, who, shortly after the action of the Secretary that is, in February, 1913, commenced proceedings by mandamus to vacate the order on the ground that it had been made without previous notice, and without affording an opportunity to be heard and to defend and therefore was not authorized by the statute, and, if it was authorized, was void because repugnant to the due process clause of the 5th Amendment.\n The trial court denied the relief, and the court of \n\n[232 U.S. 598, 600]\n\u00a0\n appeals of the district, in affirming such action, held that the statute conferred upon the Secretary power to remove without necessity of notice or hearing; and moreover, that as so construed the statute was not in conflict with the Constitution (40 App. D. C. 533). This application for the allowance of a writ of error is before us because of the reference of the same to the court by the chief justice, to whom it was primarily presented.\n The asserted right to the writ is based upon the third, fifth, and sixth paragraphs of  250 of the Judicial Code: the third conferring the right to review 'in cases involving the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States, or the constitutionality of any law of the United States;' the fifth giving such right 'in cases in which the validity of any authority exercised under the United States, or the existence or scope of any power or duty of an officer of the United States, is drawn in question;' and the sixth also giving the right to review in cases 'in which the construction of any law of the United States is drawn in question by the defendant.' [36 Stat. at L. 1159, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 231.] On the face of the record from a merely formal point of view it is apparent that the case as presented is embraced within both the third and fifth paragraphs. But it is elementary that where the jurisdiction depends upon the presence of controversies of a particular character, or the existence of prescribed questions or conditions, that substance, and not mere form, is the test of power, and therefore even in a case where the requisite for jurisdiction formally exists, the right to review does not obtain where it is evident that the formal questions, as presented by the record, are so wanting in substance as to cause them to be frivolous and devoid of all merit. Consolidated Turnp. Co. v. Norfolk & O. V. R. Co. \n228 \nU.S. 596, 600\n, 57 S. L. ed. 982, 983, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 609, and cases cited. It is true that the doctrine has generally found expression in considering the right to review cases coming from state courts, but the principle is here directly and necessarily applicable \n\n[232 U.S. 598, 601]\n\u00a0\n in consequence of the nature and character of the limitations imposed by the statute upon the right to review cases decided by the court of appeals of the District of Columbia. Coming to test the existence of jurisdiction to review the controversy, and consequently to determine whether the writ prayed for should be allowed, we are clear that the propositions upon which it is asserted jurisdiction to review exists are so wholly unsubstantial and frivolous and devoid of all merit as to afford no ground whatever for the exercise of jurisdiction and the consequent allowance of the writ.\n This conclusion is reached because we are of the opinion that, on the face of the statute, it plainly vested the Secretary of the Interior with the power and discretion to remove without the necessity of giving notice or affording a hearing, and because we are unable to perceive any basis whatever for the contention that if the statute gives such power, it conflicts with the 5th Amendment. The right to membership in the council which the statute created, and the power to remove at discretion which it conferred on the Secretary of the Interior, were indissolubly united, and it is impossible to admit the existence of the one without recognizing the other, and therefore to adopt the premise upon which the proposition must rest would be but to destroy the right to continue in office which the proposition is urged to maintain, since the office may not be treated as existing free from the safeguards concerning the discharge of its duties which the statute provides. The argument is not strengthened by confounding the asserted right of the relator to continue to be a member of the tribal council, with rights of property assumed to exist in favor of the members of the tribe, and upon the resulting confusion to urge that the assumed rights of property will be taken without due process if the authority of the Secretary to remove a member of the tribal council without notice and hearing be upheld. On the contrary, if the \n\n[232 U.S. 598, 602]\n\u00a0\n possession of the asserted property rights be assumed, it must follow that the power to remove, given by the statute, must be sustained. Considering the context of the act, the limitation which it imposes upon the members of the tribe and the tribe itself to contract, and the large administrative supervision over such subjects which the statute confers on the Secretary, it is not disputable that the right to remove for 'good cause to be by him determined' which the statute gives to the Secretary is but an appropriate means provided for the accomplishment of the duties cast upon him with reference to the subject-matters stated. Under these circumstances the proposition could not be maintained without holding that although the duty existed to protect by appropriate legislation the tribe and its members, such legislation, if enacted, would be repugnant to the Constitution.\n Writ denied. \n\n\n\n","232":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S EX REL TEXAS PORTLAND CEMENT CO. v.

The pertinent facts certified are:\n The United States, upon the relation and for the use and benefit of the Texas Portland Cement Company and others, brought suit in the United States circuit court for the northern district of Texas, on January 3, 1910, against D. C. McCord, as the principal, and the National Surety Company of New York, as surety, on a certain bond dated March 19, 1906, given in conformity to the act of February 24, 1905 (33 Stat. at L. 811, chap. 778, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1071), for the performance by McCord of a contract for the erection of certain public works for which they had furnished labor and material. The petition was filed after the completion of the contract and final settlement between the contractor and the United States, and it was alleged that the United States had no claim or cause of action against the defendants, and would not bring suit within six months from the completion and settlement of the contract, nor at any other time. An appropriate order for service and publication was had. Many creditors intervened in the case, among others W. Illingsworth, who, on May 25, 1910 (more than six and less than twelve months after final completion and settlement), filed an intervention in accordance with the act, which constituted a complete bill, purporting to be also for the benefit of the plaintiffs in the \n\n[233 U.S. 157, 159]\n\u00a0\n original suit and others intervening in the cause, and in which he prayed, if the recovery on the bond should be inadequate to pay all claims in full, for a pro rata judgment.\n Subsequently, on January 9, 1911, the original plaintiffs filed an amended original petition, elaborating the allegations of their original petition, and averring among other things that the government had no claim against the defendants, and therefore had not, within six months from the completion and settlement of the contract, brought suit against them, and did not have the legal right to maintain such suit, except upon the relation of a creditor. Illingsworth dismissed his intervention on February 2, 1911, and thereafter the court ordered that his petition and petition in intervention be dismissed.\n The allegations of the petition were sustained by proof, and a plea in abatement filed by the Surety Company was heard upon an agreement and statement in open court to the effect that the contract was completed on October 12, 1909, and settlement was made on November 11, 1909, and that the government thereafter neither had nor asserted any claim, demand, or cause of action against the defendants on the contract or bond. The circuit court thereupon dismissed the suit, and the case was taken to the circuit court of appeals upon error.\n The questions certified are:\n'First. Under the provisions of the act of August 13, 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 278, chap. 280, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2523), as amended by the act of February 24, 1905 (33 Stat. at L. 811, chap. 778, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1071), may persons who furnish material and perform labor in the construction of governmental works bring suit on the bond of the contractor in the Federal court in the name of the United States, for their use and benefit, within six months from the completion of the works and final settlement of the contract, where it appears of record and was agreed by the parties in open court, that after performance and settlement of the contract, the United States neither had nor asserted any \n\n[233 U.S. 157, 160]\n\u00a0\n claims, demands, or cause of action either against the contractor or the sureties on his bond?\n\n'Second. If the original bill was prematurely filed, was a right of action saved to the parties so filing the same, by the intervention of Illingsworth, which was filed after the six months, but before the expiration of the twelve months' period, and the amended bill, filed more than one year after the completion and settlement of the contract between the government and the contractr?'\n\n The differences in the act of February 24, 1905, and the former statute of August 13, 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 278, chap. 280, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2523), were pointed out by this court in the case of Mankin v. United States, \n215 U.S. 533\n, 54 L. ed. 315, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174, and need not be repeated here. The act of 1905 provides that the persons\n That hereafter any person or persons entering into a formal contract with the United States for the construction of any public building, or the prosecution and completion of any public work, or for repairs upon any public building or public work, shall be required, before commencing such work, to execute the usual penal bond, with good and sufficient sureties, with the additional obligation that such contractor or contractors shall promptly make payments to all persons supplying him or them with labor and materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract; and any person, company, or corporation who has furnished labor or materials used in the construction or repair of any public building or public work, and payment for which has not been made, shall have the right to intervene and be made a party to any action instituted by the United States on the bond of the contractor, and to have their rights and claims adjudicated in such action and judgment rendered thereon, subject, however, to the priority of the claim and judgment of the United States. If the full amount of the liability of the surety on said bond is insufficient to pay the full amount of said claims and demands, then, after paying the full amount due the United States, the remainder shall be distributed pro rata among said interveners. If no suit should be brought by the United States within six months from the completion and final settlement of said contract, then the person or persons supplying the contractor with labor and materials shall, upon application therefor, and furnishing affidavit to the Department under the direction of which said work has been prosecuted that labor or materials for the prosecution of such work has been supplied by him or them, and payment for which has not been made, be furnished with a certified copy of said contract and bond, upon which he or they shall have a right of action and shall be, and are hereby, authorized to bring suit in the name of the United States in the circuit court of the United States in the district in which said contract was to be performed and executed, irrespective of the amount in controversy in such suit, and not elsewhere, for his or their use and benefit, against said contractor and his sureties, and to prosecute the same to final judgment and execution: Provided, That where suit is instituted by any of such creditors on the bond of the contractor it shall not be commenced until after the complete performance of said contract and final settlement thereof, and shall be commenced within one year after the performance and final settlement of said contract, and not later: And provided further, That where suit is so instituted by a creditor or by creditors, only one action shall be brought, and any creditor may file his claim in such action and be made party thereto within one year from the completion of the work under said contract, and not later. If the recovery on the bond should be inadequate to pay the amounts found due to all of said \n\n[233 U.S. 157, 161]\n\u00a0\n named as beneficiaries under the bond may intervene and have their rights adjudicated in an action instituted by the United States in which priority of claim is to be given to the United States for any judgment recovered in the case. It is also provided that, 'if no suit should be brought by the United States within six months from the completion and final settlement of said contract,' then the persons supply-\n___ creditors, judgment shall be given to each creditor pro rata of the amount of the recovery. The surety on said bond may pay into court, for distribution among said claimants and creditors, the full amount of the the sureties' liability, to wit, the penalty named in the bond, less any amount which said surety may have had to pay to the United States by reason of the execution of said bond, and upon so doing the surety will be relieved from further liability: Provided further, That in all suits instituted under the provision of this act such personal notice of the pendency of such suits, informing them of their right to intervene as the court may order, shall be given to all known creditors, and in addition thereto notice of publication in some newspaper of general circulation, published in the state or town where the contract is being performed, for at least three successive weeks, the last publication to be at least three months before the time limited therefor. \n\n[233 U.S. 157, 162]\n\u00a0\n ing labor, etc., upon taking certain steps to get a certified copy of the bond, 'are hereby authorized to bring suit in the name of the United States,' etc., provided that suits by creditors of the contractor 'shall not be commenced until after the complete performance of said contract and final settlement thereof, and shall be commenced within one year after the performance and final settlement of said contract, and not later.' And it is further provided 'that where suit is so instituted by a creditor or by creditors, only one action shall be brought, and any creditor may file his claim in such action and be made party thereto within one year from the completion of the work under said contract, and not later.' It is further provided that in all suits instituted under the act such personal notice of the pendency of the suit shall be given as the court may order, informing known creditors of their right to intervene, and newspaper publication, to serve as notice of pendency of the suit to other creditors, shall also be made.\n By this statute a right of action upon the bond is created in favor of certain creditors of the contractor. The cause of action did not exist before, and is the creature of the statute. The act does not place a limitation upon a cause of action theretofore existing, but creates a new one upon the terms named in the statute. The right of action given to creditors is specifically conditioned upon the fact that no suit shall be brought by the United States within the six months named, for it is only in that event that the creditors shall have a right of action and may bring a suit in the manner provided. The statute thus creates a new liability and gives a special remedy for it, and upon well-settled principles the limitations upon such liability become a part of the right conferred, and compliance with them is made essential to the assertion and benefit of the liability itself.

A. 164, 183 \n\n[233 U.S. 157, 163]\n\u00a0\n Fed. 726 (circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit).\n The purpose of Congress to give the United States the exclusive right to bring suit within six months is stated in terms too plain to be mistaken or to require construction, because of any possible uncertainty in their meaning. When this is so it becomes unnecessary to inquire into the reasons which induced the legislation. It may be that Congress wished to give the government six months in which to test the work and fully ascertain its character and whether it fulfilled the contract or not. Whatever the motive, the language used clearly expresses the legislative intention and admits of no doubt as to its meaning. This being so, it is only the province of the courts to enforce the statute in accordance with its terms. Lake County v. Rollins, \n130 \nU.S. 662, 670\n, 32 S. L. ed. 1060, 1063, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 651; United States v. Lexington Mill & Elevator Co. \n232 \nU.S. 399, 409\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 337.\n We think, therefore, that the action was prematurely brought, in view of the facts stated in the certificate. This view of the statute was also taken in a well-considered opinion in the circuit court of appeals for the third circuit. Stitzer v. United States, 105 C. C. A. 51, 182 Fed. 513.\n As to the intervention of Illingsworth, in which, it is claimed, other creditors' claims were incorporated: without passing upon the effect of the dismissal of Illingsworth's intervention, we fail to see that this mends the matter. The right to intervene is given in the statute when the action is brought by the United States, and the creditors may have their rights adjudicated in such action. And in the case of an action begun by a creditor in accordance with the statute, the right to file a claim is given to creditors. These rights to intervene and to file a claim, conferred by the statute, presuppose an action duly brought under its terms. In this case the cause of action had not accrued to the creditors who undertook to bring the suit originally. The intervention could not cure this vice in the \n\n[233 U.S. 157, 164]\n\u00a0\n original suit. Nor do we think that the intervention could be treated as an original suit. No service was made or attempted to be had upon it, as required by the statute when original actions are begun by creditors. As we read the certificate, the intervention was what it purported to be,-an appearance in the original suit, already brought, and in our view must abide the fate of that suit.\n As to the effect of the filing of the amendment by the original plaintiffs on January 9, 1911, it is elementary that an amendment dates bank to the filing of the petition, and is to supply defects in the cause of action then existing, or at most to bring into the suit grounds of action which existed at the beginning of the case. In this case there was no cause of action to amend. Nor was the amendment of January 9, 1911, the introduction of a new cause of action existing at the beginning of the suit. See in this connection, American Bonding & T. Co. v. Gibson County, 76 C. C. A. 155, 145 Fed. 871, 7 Ann. Cas. 522 (circuit court of appeals for the sixth circuit, opinion by Mr. Justice Lurton). If this amended petition can be regarded as an intervention in a pending suit, and it is contended that it may be, it was too late, as it was filed more than a year after the final settlement under the contract to which time such rights of action are limited by the statute. Eberhart v. United States, 123 C. C. A. 180, 204 Fed. 884. The same objection would lie if the amended petition could be regarded as the bringing of an original suit. See Baker Contract Co. v. United States, 122 C. C. A. 560, 204 Fed. 390.\n It follows that both questions certified must be answered in the negative. \n\n\n\n","233":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S FOR USE OF ALEXANDER BRYANT CO. v.

Class for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 327, 329]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John R. Halsey and Adrian T. Kiernan for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 327, 330]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The United States, suing for the use of the Alexander Bryant Company, plaintiff in error, was plaintiff in the court below, and the defendants in error defendants.\n The complaint alleged the following facts: The New York Steam Fitting Company entered into a contract with the United States for the mechanical equipment of the New York custom house at New York. It gave bond for the faithful performance of its contract with defendant in error the Title Guaranty & Surety Company, as surety. One of the conditions of the bond was that the Steam Fitting Company would, among other things, promptly make a payment to all persons supplying it labor and material in the prosecution of the work contemplated by the contract of the Steam Fitting Company with the United States.\n The bond was accepted and the work undertaken and duly completed on or about February 19, 1908, the Alexander Bryant Company having, in pursuance of a contract with the Steam Fitting Company, furnished all the materials and performed all of the work, upon which there is a balance due to the Bryant Company of $5,431.18. Under the terms of the agreement between it and the Steam Fitting Company it should have been paid as the government paid the former; and as final payment was made by the government February 15, 1908, interest is demanded.\n No action, it is alleged, had been brought by the United States against defendant within six months after, nor had one year elapsed since, the performance and final settle- \n\n[235 U.S. 327, 331]\n\u00a0\n ment of the contract by the New York Steam Fitting Company prior to the commencement of this action.\n It is alleged that, in pursuance of the requirements of the act of Congress of August 13, 1894 (28 Stat. at L. 278, chap. 280), as amended February 24, 1905 (33 Stat. at L. 811, chap. 778, Comp. Stat. 1913,  6923 ), under and by virtue of which this action is brought, complainant served personal notice of the pendency of this action upon all known creditors, informing them of their right to intervene as the court might order, and in addition thereto published the notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, county, and state of New York for three successive weeks, the last publication of which was three months before the time limited therefor as in the acts of Congress provided.\n A bill of particulars was furnished defendants, of which the following is a copy:\n'The plaintiff as and for a bill of particulars, demanded by the Title Guaranty & Surety Company herein avers-\n\n'That, pursuant to the requirements of the acts of Congress under which this action is brought, the plaintiff herein made personal service of notice of the pendency of this action upon all known creditors of the New York Steam Fitting Company as follows:\n\n'On Messrs. Peet and Powers, November 21st, 1908; on Hermann & Grace, November 21st, 1908; on Henry R. Worthington, November 19th, 1908; on John Simmons Company, November 20th, 1908; on Cutler Hammer Company, November 19th, 1908; on Rob't A. Keasby Company, November 20th, 1908\n\n\n\n'That under date of November 21st, 1908, Messrs. Hardy & Shellabarger, attorneys for New York Steam Fitting Company and the Title Guaranty & Trust Company of Scranton, Pennsylvania (now the Title Guaranty & Surety Company), stipulated with the attorney for the plaintiff as follows:\n\n\"It is hereby consented on the part of the defendants \n\n[235 U.S. 327, 332]\n\u00a0\n that defendants waive any failure on the part of the plaintiff to notify creditors under the third proviso of the statute, provided no more such notices are sent.'\n\n'That on the 5th day of November, 1908, and on each day thereafter to and including November 25th, 1908, there was published in the New York press of New York city, New York, a notice of the pendency of this action, addressed to all known creditors of the defendant, the New York Steam Fitting Company. Attached hereto and forming a part of this bill of particulars is a copy of the form in which personal notice of the pendency of this action was served upon all known creditors of the New York Steam Fitting Company, and a copy of the notice which was given by publication in the New York press to aforesaid creditors. Dated, New York, December 7th, 1909.'\n\n Copies of the notices are inserted in the margin. It\n'Please take notice that the abovenamed Alexander Bryant Company has commenced an action in the name of the United States of America under the provisions of the act of Congress of August 13th, 1894 (as amended by act of Congress of February 24th, 1905), to recover a judgment against the defendant New York Steam Fitting Company and its surety, the Title Guaranty & Trust Company of Scranton, Pennsylvania, for a sum of money alleged to be due and owing to the aforesaid Alexander Bryant Company for work, labor, materials, and services furnished as subcontractors under the contract and bond entered into by the New York Steam Fitting Company for the mechanical equipment of the new customhouse at New York city, New York, in which bond the defendant, the Title Guaranty & Trust Company of Scranton, Pennsylvania, is joined as surety.\n\n'As required by the express provisions of the aforementioned acts of Congress, and as one of the creditors of the New York Steam Fitting Company, under aforesaid contract, you are hereby notified of your right to intervene and be made an additional party plaintiff in this action, as the court may order, so as to have the rights and claims of any and all existing creditors under said contract and bond adjudicated in one and the same action.\n\n'Dated, New York, Nov. 2d, 1908.'\n\n'Pursuant to the requirements of an act of Congress of August 13th, 1894, and of February 24th, 1905, amendatory thereof, notice is hereby given to all creditors of the above named defendant New York Steam Fitting Company under the contract between the plaintiff and the said lastnamed defendant (and the codefendant as their surety) for work incident to the construction of the customhouse, that the above entitled action has been instituted upon the bond of the defendant-contractor, and against said surety, and that any creditor may file his claim in this action and be made a party herein as in said acts of Congress provided.\n\n'New York, October 16th, 1908.'\n\n Both notices were signed by plaintiff's attorney. \n\n[235 U.S. 327, 333]\n\u00a0\n was stipulated that certain of the creditors who were served with personal notice appeared in the action and filed pleas of intervention. The action was subsequently discontinued as to them, they having been settled with by the Surety Company.\n The answer of the Surety Company is unimportant except so far as it raises the issue, which is the crux of the case, whether the action was brought in time, or whether proper notice of it was given to other creditors.\n The answer of the Steam Fitting Company is also unimportant.\n The case, by consent of the parties, was referred to a referee, upon whose report judgment was to be entered 'as if said cause had been heard before the court.'\n The referee found and reported the basic facts of liability of the Surety Company, but found besides that the action was not commenced in time, as provided by the acts of Congress, nor was notice given to creditors as required, and therefore directed a judgment dismissing the complaint. A judgment was subsequently entered by the court after motion for a new trial was denied by the referee.\n The following facts appear from the report of the referee: The date of final settlement between the United States and the Steam Fitting Company was February 19, 1908, and to show compliance with the provisions of the act of Congress set out below, the Bryant Company \n\n[235 U.S. 327, 334]\n\u00a0\n offered evidence of the publication of notice to creditors in the New York press, beginning November 5, 1908, and also introduced in evidence a stipulation between it and the defendants made November 21, 1908, by which defendants' time to move of plead was extended, and by which it was stipulated as follows:\n'It is hereby consented on the part of the defendants that defendants waive any failure on the part of the plaintiff to notify creditors under the third proviso of the statute, provided no more such notices are sent.'\n\n Prior to the execution of the stipulation the Bryant Company had personally served all known creditors with notice in the form hereinbefore given. Notwithstanding the stipulation, notice by publication continued for the full twenty-one days, to and including November 25, 1908.\n The Surety Company moved to strike out the evidence of publication as incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial on the grounds: (1) That there was no order of the court obtained for the giving of the notice. (2) That under the act of Congress the last publication of such a notice must expire three months before the end of the year after the final completion of the contract; that is, on November 18th, 1908, whereas the last publication of the notice offered in evidence was on November 25, 1908, seven days beyond the time.\n The motion was based on certain provisos of the act of Congress already referred to. The act is entitled, 'An Act for the Protection of Persons Furnishing Materials and Labor for the Construction of Public Works.' It provides for the execution of a bond by any person entering into any formal contract with the United States for any public work, and that in any action instituted by the United States any person who has furnished materials or labor to the contractor may intervene and become a party to the action. If no action be brought by the United States within six months from the completion and final settle- \n\n[235 U.S. 327, 335]\n\u00a0\n ment of the contract, then any person furnishing materials or labor may bring suit in the name of the United States in the circuit court of the United States [now district court] in the district in which the contract was to be performed and executed, irrespective of the amount in controversy, and not elsewhere, for his or their use and benefit, against the contractor and his sureties.\n The provisos are as follows:\n'provided, that where suit is instituted by any of such creditors on the bond of the contractor it shall not be commenced until after the complete performance of said contract and final settlement thereof, and shall be commenced within one year after performance and final settlement of said contract, and not later:\n\n'And provided further, that where suit is so instituted by a creditor or by creditors, only one action shall be brought, and any creditor may file his claim in such action and be made party thereto within one year from the completion of the work under said contract, and not later. . . .\n\n'Provided further, that in all suits instituted under the provisions of this act such personal notice of the pendency of such suits, informing them of their right to intervene as the court may order, shall be given to all known creditors, and in addition thereto notice of publication in some newspaper of general circulation, published in the state or town where the contract is being performed, for at least three successive weeks, the last publication to be at least three months before the time limited therefor.'\n\n It was admitted that no court order was obtained specifying the kind of notice to be given creditors, or giving directions as to publication.\n The referee decided that an order of the court was necessary, and that 'the publication proved did not come within the time limit of the statute.'\n The argument of the referee was that the conditions \n\n[235 U.S. 327, 336]\n\u00a0\n of suit by the creditors of a contractor were (1) the omission of the United States to sue within six months from the completion and final settlement; (2) an action by a creditor must be commenced within one year after such performance and final settlement; (3) only one action can be brought, in which any creditor may file his claim and be made a party thereto within one year from the completion of the work under said contract, and not later; (4) personal notice must be given to known creditors, and in addition notice by publication, the last publication to be at least three months before the time limited therefor. In other words, and succinctly, the referee held that the time for a suit by creditors must be within one year from the complete performance of the contract and its final settlement, and as there could be only one action, this time was the limit within which other creditors could file their claims, and that notice to them, whether personal or by publication, must be in such time as to enable this to be done. He held further that this was a jurisdictional requirement. In this ruling the district court concurred and certified 'that the jurisdiction of the court over the persons and subject-matter in this action is in issue,' and that this was done in accordance with the provisions of  238 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, Comp. Stat. 1913,  1215].\n Defendants in error, however, move to dismiss the writ of error on the ground 'that no question as to the jurisdiction of the court below to hear and determine the cause is in issue.'\n Under  238 of the Judicial Code a case may be brought here directly from a district court if the jurisdiction of the court was in issue, that question alone to be certified.\n The present case satisfies this requirement. The controversy between the parties must have been understood by the referee and the district court to involve the jurisdiction of the court. Indeed, such was the explicit contention of the Surety Company, and both referee and \n\n[235 U.S. 327, 337]\n\u00a0\n court in the decision of the issue thus presented dismissed the action. The Bryant Company combated the conclusion and still combats it. The issue of jurisdiction was and is, therefore, plainly marked. It may be that the referee and the court were in error in their decision, but this could not be asserted or demonstrated except by proceedings in error, to be taken as prescribed by law, and to this court. We cannot make the possible error of the court a ground for refusing to review it. The right of review is given to correct the error, if error there be, and the decision of the question involved is given to this court by  238 of the Judicial Code. We are brought, therefore, to the consideration of the correctness of the ruling.\n The act of Congress is undoubtedly ambiguous. Indeed, considering the letter only of the three provisos with which we are concerned, they absolutely repel accommodation. We must try, however, to give coherence to them, and accomplish the intention of Congress. The act is intended to be highly remedial. Its purpose is simple and beneficial. It is to give a remedy to materialmen and laborers on the bond of the original contractor, and a reasonable time to enforce it, and in a single proceeding to unite all claimants. It, however, imposes a limitation of time on all claimants, the time beginning to run from the same event. From this the complexity in the construction of the act arises.\n By the first proviso of the act a creditor cannot institute suit until after the complete performance of the contract and its final settlement; but after such events he may do so (the United States not having sued) within one year from their fulfilment. This is clear enough. The next proviso introduces ambiguity. 'Only one action shall be brought,' is its provision, in which 'any creditor may file his claim . . . and be made a party thereto within one year from the completion of the work, and not later.' The words in italics are disturbing. 'This \n\n[235 U.S. 327, 338]\n\u00a0\n right to intervene and file a claim, conferred by the statute, presupposes an action duly brought under its terms.' United States ex rel. Texas Protland Cement Co. v. McCord, \n233 \nU.S. 157, 163\n, 58 S. L. ed. 893, 897, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 550. But by its terms the instituting creditor has one year from the designated events to commence his action. If he file it on the last day of the designated time, what then becomes of the rights of other creditors who must file their claim within the same limit of time, and not later? The question is not easy to answer and any answer may be disputed. It presents a puzzle for judicial resolution apparently insolvable.\n There is more ambiguity when we bring forward the next, and third, proviso. Notice of the suit must be given to creditors personally if they be known, and by publication besides, informing them 'of their right to intervene as the court may order.' Passing what the quoted words may mean, and coming to the requirement of notice, it is provided that it must be 'for at least three successive weeks, the last publication to be at least three months before the time limited therefor.'\n This seemingly brings us to an impasse. How can the instituting creditor (so called for convenience) have a year to commence his suit and yet give the notice required?-and it is to be remembered that the intervening creditor must file his claim also within a year.\n The Surety Company sees the difficulty and seizes it to press its contention that the year's time for bringing suit is not an authorization of such time, but a permission, and must be availed of so as to permit of the notice to creditors provided for; in other words, that the time in which to bring suit or file a claim, which is explicitly given, is cut down by the provision for notice; that is, the instituting creditor is given not one year from the indicated events to institute a suit, but one year to institute suit and serve notice of it, which notice must precede the expiration of the year by at least three months and three weeks. This \n\n[235 U.S. 327, 339]\n\u00a0\n limitation of time is brought about, it is contended, with all of its embarrassment to the creditor who institutes the suit and to the creditors who may want to intervene in it, by the third proviso, which is made all- dominating, bending the other provisions to it, and made even a jurisdictional condition of suit against the sureties of the contractor.\n There are grounds for the contention, but there are opposing grounds, which, we think, are supported by the better reason, all things considered. As we have said, the act of Congress is highly remedial, and its provisions must be adapted to fulfil its whole purpose.\n In Vermont Marble Co. v. National Surety Co. 213 Fed. 429, the circuit court of appeals for the third circuit had occasion to pass upon the act of Congress under consideration. The court, Circuit Judge Gray speaking for it, decided against the contention now made by the Surety Company. The careful review and exposition of the statute there made leave little else to be said.\n That case illustrates the consequences of the contention of defendants in error. Here the contention is urged to defeat a suit by the instituting creditor against the surety of the contractor; there it was urged to defeat a claim of an intervening creditor.\n The suit was on a contractor's bond by one who furnished materials to the contractor. The work was completed and final settlement made June 14, 1912. The suit was brought February 28, 1913, within one year from the completion of the work. Notice to creditors was given by publication, the last publication being on April 9, 1913, twenty-three days prior to the expiration of the time within which the suit could have been brought. The Vermont Marble Company intervened and filed its statement of claim within the time prescribed by the statute. The claim was resisted on the ground that publication of notice \n\n[235 U.S. 327, 340]\n\u00a0\n to creditors should have been so made that the last publication would have been at least three months before the time limited for bringing the suit, and therefore should have been started not later than February 21, 1913 ( it was started February 28th, as we have seen), so that the last publication should have been on or before March 14, 1913, three months before June 14, 1913, the time when the right to bring suit expired. It was contended that the suit not having been brought nor publication made within the time required by the act, it could not be maintained either by the original plaintiff or the Vermont Marble Company or other intervening creditors. The contention found favor with the district court; it was rejected by the court of appeals. The latter court concluded that the third proviso was directory, and not a limitation upon the right of action given by the other provisos.\n United States ex rel. Texas Portland Cement Co. v. McCord, \n233 U.S. 157\n, 58 L. ed. 893, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 550, does not militate against that conclusion. In the latter case it was decided that no right of action accrued to a materialman until the time reserved to the United States to sue had expired, and that this condition was expressed too clearly to be mistaken.\n It is urged that it is a consequence of our construction that an action may be commenced on the last day of the year, and that all opportunity for intervention may be precluded; for, counsel say, 'intervention cannot be conducted in a day,' and it would seem as if the act intended 'to afford creditors an interval of three months within which to secure an intervention.' Even if this be the consequence, some of the provisions of the act, as we have intimated, must give way. We can only select those which we consider the fittest to prevail to accomplish the purposes of the statute; and at the very start comes the suggestion that even if it be granted that the diligent creditor is under obligation to give notice to a waiting or tardy, or, it may be, unwilling one, how is the surety of \n\n[235 U.S. 327, 341]\n\u00a0\n the contractor concerned with the discharge of the obligation? At the most its concern is only to be protected against claims delayed beyond the limit of time provided by the act. We may refer again to Vermont Marble Co. v. National Surety Co. The court in that case, in careful distinction between the purposes of the provisos, said that the first and second confer a substantive right of action or intervention limited only by a time for assertion; that is, one year from the completion of the work; and that that time was 'obviously for the benefit of the sureties on the bond;' while the last proviso (the third) was 'just as obviously for the benefit of the creditors alone.' It was pointed out that indeed it was to the interest of the sureties not to bring in the other creditors, and yet they contended that the provision for notice to the creditors was mandatory and jurisdictional, and not simply directory. The same contention is made in this case. In other words, it is in effect contended that a provision which it is to the interest of the Surety Company not to have observed the statute gave it a right to have observed. Such a contradiction of interests and rights we cannot assume the statute intended to create, nor that it was intended to give to the Surety Company a right to have done that which it is its interest not to have performed. The provision for notice, therefore, is not of the essence of jurisdiction over the case, nor a condition of the liability of the Surety Company. We need not go farther in this case.\n In the cited case it was held that the third proviso was directory only, and the conclusion has reason to sustain it. There can be no sacrifice of rights in it, neither of surety companies nor of creditors. Every creditor has the same rights and may institute the action provided for in the first proviso. If he does not choose to do so it is his own affair; and he may guard against surprise or deception. He knows the time limit of suit and of intervention. He knows \n\n[235 U.S. 327, 342]\n\u00a0\n that the suit must be brought in the district court of the United States in the distract where the contract was performed. It would seem as if the law owed him no further care. If he chooses he may institute proceedings if another has not done so. If another has, he knows in what court and within what time, and he may intervene. He has, therefore, the means of suit or the means of intervention. An attentive waiting is all that is necessary for either, and indeed is his ultimate safeguard, as intervention must depend on a suit previously instituted.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","234":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

The provisions of  4 of the act to regulate commerce [24 Stat. at L. 380, chap. 104, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3155], dealing with what is known as the long and short haul clause, the power of \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 478]\n\u00a0\n carriers because of dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions to deviate from the exactions of such clause, and the authority of the Interstate Comerce Commission in relation to such subjects, were materially amended by the act of June 18, 1910, chap. 309, 36 Stat. at L. 547, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1288. Following the form prescribed by the Commission after the amendment in question, the seventeen carriers who are appellees on this record made to the Interstate Commerce Commission their 'application for relief from provisions of 4th section of amended commerce act in connection with the following tariffs.' The tariffs annexed to the applications covered the whole territory from the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific coast and the Gulf of Mexico, including all interior points, and embracing practically the entire country, and the petition asked the Interstate Commerce Commission for authority to continue all rates shown on the tariffs from the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific coast, and from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic seaboard, and to and from interior points lower than rates concurrently in effect from and to intermediate points. It was stated in the petition: 'This application is based upon the desire of the interested carriers to continue the present method of making rates lower at the more distant points than at the intermediate points; such lower rates being necessary by reason of competition of various water carriers and of carriers partly by water and partly by rail operating from Pacific coast ports to Atlantic seaboard ports; competition of various water carriers operating to foreign countries from Pacific coast ports; and competition of the products of foreign countries with the products of the Pacific coast; competition of the products of Pacific coast territory with the products of other sections of the country; competition of Canadian rail carriers not subject to the interstate commerce act; competition of the products of Canada moving by Canadian carriers with the products of the United States; rates established via \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 479]\n\u00a0\n the shorter or more direct routes, but applied also via the longer or more circuitous routes.' After full hearing the Commission refused to grant unqualifiedly the prayer of the petition, but entered an order permitting in some respects a charge of a lower rate for the longer haul to the Pacific coast than was asked for intermediate points provided a proportionate relation was maintained between the lower rate for the longer haul to the Pacific coast and the higher rate to the intermediate points, the proportion to be upon the basis of percentages which were fixed. For the purposes of the order in question the Commission in substance adopted a division of the entire territory into separate zones, which division had been resorted to by the carriers for the purposes of the establishment of the rates in relation to which the petition was filed. Refusing to comply with this order the carriers commenced proceedings in the commerce court praying a decree enjoining the enforcement of the 4th section as amended on the ground of its repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States, and of the order as being in any event violative of the amended section as properly construed. An interlocutory injunction was ordered. The defendants moved to dismiss, and, on the overruling of the motions, appealed from the interlocutory order, the case being No. 136. Subsequently, upon the election of the defendants to plead no further, a final decree was entered and appealed from, that appeal being No. 162.\n It suffices at this moment to say that all the contentions which the assignments of error involve and every argument advanced to refute such contentions, including every argument urged to uphold, on the one hand, or to overthrow, on the other, the action of the Commission, as well as every reason relied upon to challenge the action of the court or to sustain its judgment, are all reducible to the following propositions:\n\n\n (a)\n The absolute want of power of the court below to \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 480]\n\u00a0\n deal with the subject involved in the complaint because controversies concerning the 4th section of the act to regulate commerce of the nature here presented were, by an express statutory provision, excluded from the cognizance of the court below. (b) That even if this be not the case, the action of the Commission which was complained of was purely negative, and therefore not within the cognizance of the court, because not inherently justiciable. (c) That, correctly interpreting the 4th section, the order made by the Commission was absolutely void because wholly beyond the scope of any power conferred by the 4th section as amended. (d) That even if, in some respects, the order of the Commission was within the reach of its statutory power, there was intermingled in the order such an exertion of authority not delegated as to cause the whole order to be void. (e) That the order of the Commission was void even if the 4th section be interpreted as conferring the authority which the Commission exerted, since, under that assumption, the 4th section as amended was repugnant to the Constitution.\n All the propositions, even including the jurisdictional ones, are concerned with and depend upon the construction of the 4th section as amended, and we proceed to consider and pass upon that subject and every other question in the case under four separate headings: 1, the meaning of the statute; 2, its constitutionality; 3, the jurisdiction of the court; 4, the validity of the order in the light of the statute as interpreted.\n\n 1. \nThe meaning of the statute.\n We reproduce the section as originally adopted and as amended, passing a line through the words omitted by the amendment, and printing in italics those which were added by the amendment, thus at a glance enabling the section to be read as it was before and as it now stands after amendment.\n'Sec. 4. That it shall be unlawful for any common car- \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 481]\n\u00a0\n rier subject to the provisions of this Act to charge or receive any greater compensation in the aggregate for the transportation of passengers, or of like kind of property, for a shorter than for a longer distance over the same line or route in the same direction, the shorter being included within the longer distance, or to charge any greater compensation as a through route than the aggregate of the intermediate rates subject to the provisions of this Act; but this shall not be construed as authorizing any common carrier within the terms of this Act to charge or receive as great compensation for a shorter as for a longer distance: Provided, however, That upon application to the Interstate Commerce Commission such common carrier may in special cases, after investigation be authorized by the Commission to charge less for longer than for shorter distances for the transportation of passengers or property; and the Commission may from time to time prescribe the extent to which such designated common carrier may be relieved from the operation of this section Provided, further, That no rates or charges lawfully existing at the time of the passage of this amendatory Act shall be required to be changed by reason of the provisions of this section prior to the expiration of six months after the passage of this Act, nor in any case where application shall have been filed before the Commission, in accordance with the provisions of this section, until a determination of such application by the Commission.\n\n'Whenever a carrier by railroad shall in competition with a water route or routes reduce the rates on the carriage of any species of freight to or from competitive points, it shall not be permitted to increase such rates unless after hearing by the In-Interstate Commerce Commission it shall be found that such proposed increase rests upon changed conditions other than the elimination of water competition.' \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 482]\n\u00a0\n Before considering the amended text we state briefly some of the more important requirements of the section before amendment and the underlying conceptions of private right, of public duty and policy which it embodied, because to do so will go a long way to remove any doubt as to the amended text, and will moreover serve to demonstrate the intent of the legislative mind in enacting the amendment.\n\n Almost immediately after the adoption of the act to regulate commerce in 1887 the Interstate Commerce Commission, in considering the meaning of the law and the scope of the duties imposed on the Commission in enforcing it, reached the conclusion that the words 'under substantially similar circumstances and conditions' of the 4th section dominated the long and short haul clause and empowered carriers to primarily determine the existence of the required dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions, and consequently to exact in the event of such difference a lesser charge for the longer than was exacted for the shorter haul, and that competition which materially affected the rate of carriage to a particular point was a dissimilar circumstance and condition within the meaning of the act. We say primarily, because of course it was further recognized that the authority existing in carriers to the end just stated was subject to the supervision and control of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the exertion of the powers conferred upon it by the statute, and especially in view of the authority stated in the 4th section. In considering the act comprehensively it was pointed out that the generic provisions against preference and discrimination expressed in the 2d and 3d sections of the act were all-embracing, and were therefore operative upon the 4th section as well as upon all other provisions of the act. But it was pointed out that where, within the purview of the 4th section, it had lawfully resulted that \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 483]\n\u00a0\n the lesser rate was charged for a longer than was exacted for a shorter haul, such exaction, being authorized, could not be a preference or discrimination and therefore illegal. Re Louisville & N. R. Co. 1 I. C. C. Rep. 31, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 278. These comprehensive views announced at the inception as a matter of administrative construction were subsequently sustained by many decisions of this court, and to the leading of such cases we refer in the margin. \n1\n We observe, moreover, that in addition it came to be settled that where competitive conditions authorized carriers to lower their rates to a particular place, the right to meet the competition by lowering rates to such place was not confined to shipments made from the point of origin of the competition, but empowered all carriers, in the interest of freedom of commerce and to afford enlarged opportunity to shippers, to accept, if they chose to do so, shipments to such competitive points at lower rates than their general tariff rates: a right which came aptly to be described as 'market competition' because the practice served to enlarge markets and develop the freedom of traffic and intercourse. It is to be observed, however, that the right thus conceded was not absolute, because its exercise was only permitted provided the rates were not so lowered as to be nonremunerative, and thereby cast an unnecessary burden upon other shippers. East Tennessee, V. & G. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n181 U.S. 1\n, 45 L. ed. 719, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 516. As the statute as thus construed imposed no obligation to carry to the competitive point at a rate which was less than a reasonable one, it is obvious that the statute regarded the rights of private ownership, and sought to impose no duty conflicting therewith. It is also equally clear that in permitting the carrier \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 484]\n\u00a0\n to judge primarily of the competitive conditions, and to meet them at election, the statute lodged in the carrier the right to exercise a primary judgment concerning a matter of public concern broader than the mere question of the duty of a carrier to carry for a reasonable rate on the one hand, and of the right of the shipper, on the other, to compel carriage at such rate, since the power of primary judgment which the statute conferred concerned in a broad sense the general public interest with reference to both persons and places,-considerations all of which, therefore, in their ultimate aspects, came within the competency of legislative regulation. It was apparent that the power thus conferred was primary, not absolute, since its exertion by the carrier was made by the statute the subject both of administrative control and ultimate judicial review. And the establishment of such control in and of itself serves to make manifest the public nature of the attributes conferred upon the carrier by the original 4th section. Indeed, that in so far as the statute empowered the carrier to judge as to the dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions for the purpose of relief from the long and short haul clause, it but gave the carrier the power to exert a judgment as to things public, was long since pointed out by this court. Texas & P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 \nU.S. 197, 218\n, 40 S. L. ed. 940, 947, 5 Inters. Com. Rep. 405, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 666.\n With the light afforded by the statements just made we come to consider the amendment. It is certain that the fundamental change which it makes is the omission of the substantially similar circumstances and conditions clause, thereby leaving the long and short haul clause in a sense unqualified except in so far as the section gives the right to the carrier to apply to the Commission for authority 'to charge less for longer than for shorter distances for the transportation of persons or property,' and gives the Commission authority from time to time 'to prescribe the extent to which such designated common carrier may \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 485]\n\u00a0\n be relieved from the operation of this section.' From the failure to insert any word in the amendment tending to exclude the operation of competition as adequate under proper circumstances to justify the awarding of relief from the long and short haul clause, and there being nothing which minimizes or changes the application of the preference and discrimination clauses of the 2d and 3d sections, it follows that in substance the amendment intrinsically states no new rule or principle, but simply shifts the powers conferred by the section as it originally stood; that is, it takes from the carriers the deposit of public power previously lodged in them and vests it in the Commission as a primary instead of a reviewing function. In other words, the elements of judgment, or, so to speak, the system of law by which judgment is to be controlled, remains unchanged, but a different tribunal is created for the enforcement of the existing law. This being true, as we think it plainly is, the situation under the amendment is this: Power in the carrier primarily to meet competitive conditions in any point of view by charging a lesser rate for a longer than for a shorter haul has ceased to exist, because to do so, in the absence of some authority, would not only be inimical to the provision of the 4th section, but would be in conflict with the preference and discrimination clauses of the 2d and 3d sections. But while the public power, so to speak, previously lodged in the carrier, is thus withdrawn and reposed in the Commission, the right of carriers to seek and obtain under authorized circumstances the sanction of the Commission to charge a lower rate for a longer than for a shorter haul because of competition or for other adequate reasons is expressly preserved, and, if not, is, in any event, by necessary implication, granted. And as a correlative the authority of the Commission to grant on request the right sought is made by the statute to depend upon the facts established and the judgment of that body, in the exercise of a sound \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 486]\n\u00a0\n legal discretion, as to whether the request should be granted compatibly with a due consideration of the private and public interests concerned, and in view of the preference and discrimination clauses of the 2d and 3d sections.\n\n 2. \nThe alleged repugnancy of the section as amended to the Constitution.\n But if the amendment has this meaning, it is insisted that it is repugnant to the Constitution for various reasons which, superficially considered, seem to be distinct, but which really are all so interwoven that we consider and dispose of them as one. The argument is that the statute, as correctly construed, is but a delegation to the Commission of legislative power which Congress was incompetent to make. But the contention is without merit. Marshall Field Co. v. Clark, \n143 U.S. 649\n, 36 L. ed. 294, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 495; Buttfield v. Stranahan, \n192 U.S. 470\n, 48 L. ed. 525, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 349; Union Bridge Co. v. United States, \n204 U.S. 364\n, 51 L. ed. 523, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 367; United States v. Heinszen, \n206 U.S. 370\n, 51 L. ed. 1098, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 742, 11 Ann. Cas. 688; St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Taylor, \n210 U.S. 281\n, 52 L. ed. 1061, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 616, 21 Am. Neg. Rep. 464; Monongahela Bridge Co. v. United States, \n216 U.S. 177\n, 54 L. ed. 435, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 356. We do not stop to review these cases because the mere statement of the contention, in the light of its environment, suffices to destroy it. How can it otherwise be since the argument as applied to the case before us is this: that the authority in question was validly delegated so long as it was lodged in carriers, but ceased to be susceptible of delegation the instant it was taken from the carriers for the purpose of being lodged in a public administrative body? Indeed, when it is considered that, in last analysis, the argument is advanced to sustain the right of carriers to exert the public power which it is insisted is not susceptible of delegation, it is apparent that the contention is self-contradictory, since it reduces itself to an effort to sustain the right to delegate a power by contending that the power is not capable of being delegated. In addition, however, before passing from the proposition, we observe that, when rightly appreciated, the contention but challenges every decided case since the \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 487]\n\u00a0\n passage of the act to regulate commerce in 1887, involving the rightfulness of the exertion by a carrier of the power to meet competition as a means of being relieved from the long and short haul clause of the 4th section before its amendment. While what we have already said answers it, because of its importance we notice another contention. As the power of carriers to meet competition, and the relation of that right to noncompetitive places, may concern the fortunes of numberless individuals and the progress and development of many communities, it is said, to permit authority to be exerted concerning the subject without definite rules for its exercise will be to destroy the rights of persons and communities. This danger, the argument proceeds, is not obviated by declaring that the provisions of the 2d and 3d sections as to undue preference and discrimination apply to the 4th section, since, without a definition of what constitutes undue preference and discrimination, no definite rule of law is established, but whim, caprice, or favor will, in the nature of things, control the power exerted. And it is argued that this view is not here urged as the mere result of conjecture, since, in the report of the Commission in this case, it was declared in unequivocal terms as the basis of the order entered that the statute vested in the Commission a wide and undefined discretion by virtue of which it became its duty to see to it that communities and individuals obtained fair opportunities, that discord was allayed, and commercial justice everywhere given full play. Let it be conceded that the language relied upon would have the far-reaching significance attributed to it if separated from its context, we think when it is read in connection with the report of which it but forms a part, and moreover, when it is elucidated by the action taken by the Commission, there is no substantial ground for holding that, by the language referred to, it was entitled to declare that the 4th section as amended conferred the uncon- \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 488]\n\u00a0\n trolled exuberance of vague and destructive powers which it is now insisted was intended to be claimed. In any event, however, we must be governed by the statute and its plain meaning. After all has been said, the provisions as to undue preference and discrimination, while involving, of course, a certain latitude of judgment and discretion, are no more undefined or uncertain in the section as amended than they have been from the beginning; and therefore the argument comes once more to the complaint that because public powers have been transferred from the carriers to the Commission, the wrongs suggested will arise. Accurately testing this final result of the argument it is clear that it exclusively rests upon convictions concerning the impolicy of having taken from carriers, intimately and practically acquainted as they are with the complex factors entering into rate making, and moreover impelled to equality of treatment as they must be by the law of self-interest operating upon them as a necessary result of the economic forces to which they are subjected, and having lodged the power in an official administrative body which, in the nature of things, must act, however conscientiously, from conceptions based upon a more theoretical and less practical point of view. But this does not involve a grievance based upon the construction or application of the 4th section as amended, but upon the wisdom of the legislative judgment which was brought into play in adopting the amendment,-a subject with which we have nothing in the world to do. It is said in the argument on behalf of one of the carriers that as in substance and effect the duty is imposed upon the Commission in a proper case to refuse an application, therefore the law is void because in such a contingency the statute would amount to an imperative enforcement of the long and short haul clause and would be repugnant to the Constitution. It is conceded in the argument that it has been directly decided by this court that a general enforcement \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 489]\n\u00a0\n of the long and short haul clause would not be repugnant to the Constitution (Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Kentucky, \n183 U.S. 503\n, 46 L. ed. 298, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 95), but we are asked to reconsider and overrule the case, and thus correct the error which was manifested in deciding it. But we are not in the remotest degree inclined to enter into this inquiry, not only because of the reasons which were stated in the case itself, but also because of those already expounded in this opinion, and for an additional reason, which is, that the contention by necessary implication assails the numerous cases which, from the enactment of the act to regulate commerce down to the present time, have involved the adequacy of the conditions advanced by carriers for justifying their departure from the long and short haul clause. We say this because the controversies which the many cases referred to considered and decided by a necessary postulate involved an assertion of the validity of the legislative power to apply and enforce the long and short haul clause. How can it be otherwise since, if this were not the case, all the issues presented in the numerous cases would have been merely but moot, affording, therefore, no basis for judicial action, since they would have had back of them no sanction of lawful power whatever.\n\n 3. \nThe jurisdiction of the court.\n The argument on this subject is twofold: (a) that as by the act creating the commerce court, that court was endowed only with the jurisdiction 'now possessed by circuit courts of the United States and the judges thereof,' and provided that 'nothing contained in this act shall be construed as enlarging the jurisdiction now possessed by the circuit courts of the United States or the judges thereof, that is hereby transferred to and vested in the commerce court;' and as new powers were created by the subsequent amendment of the 4th section, therefore the commerce court had no jurisdiction. But we pass any extended discussion of \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 490]\n\u00a0\n the proposition because it is completely disposed of by the construction which we have given to the amended section, since that construction makes it clear that the effect of the amended 4th section was not to create new powers theretofore nonexisting, but simply to redistribute the powers already existing and which were then subject to review. The argument affords another manifestation of the tendency to which we have already directed attention in this case to seek to maintain and aggrandize a power by insisting upon propositions which, if they were accepted, would raise the gravest question as to the constitutional validity of the asserted power,-a question which we need not at all consider in view of the want of foundation for the exercise of the power claimed in the light of the plain meaning of the act to the contrary which we have already pointed out.\n\n\n (b)\n The second contention as to jurisdiction yet further affords an illustration of the same mental attitude, since it rests upon the assumption that the order of the Commission refusing to grant the request of the carrier made under the 4th section was purely negative, and hence was not subject to judicial inquiry. The contention therefore presupposes that the power which, from the beginning, has been the subject of judicial review, by the mere fact of its transfer to the Commission was made arbitrary. Besides, the proposition disregards the fact that the right to petition the Commission conferred by the statute is positive, and while the refusal to grant it may be in one sense negative, in another and broader view it is affirmative, since it refuses that which the statute in affirmative terms declares shall be granted if only the conditions which the statute provides are found to exist. It is, of course, true, as pointed out in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois C. R. Co. \n215 \nU.S. 452, 470\n, 54 S. L. ed. 280, 287, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 155, and since repeatedly applied, that findings of fact made by the Commission within the scope of its administrative \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 491]\n\u00a0\n duties must be accepted in case of judicial review, but that doctrine, as was also pointed out, does not relieve the courts in a proper case from determining whether the Constitution has been violated or whether statutory powers conferred have been transcended, or have been exercised in such an arbitrary way as to amount to the exertion of authority not given,-doctrines which but express the elementary principle that an investiture of a public body with discretion does not imply the right to abuse, but, on the contrary, carries which it as a necessary incident the command that the limits of a sound discretion be not transcended; which, by necessary implication, carries with it the existence of judicial power to correct wrongs done by such excess. And without pausing to particularly notice it, we observe in passing that what has just been said is adequate to meet the contention that, as violations of the 4th section were made criminal, no power existed to enjoin an order of the Commission made under that section because the consequence would be to enjoin criminal prosecution. The right which, as we have seen, the act gives to test the validity of orders rendered under the 4th section, is not to be destroyed by a reference to a provision of that section. The two must be harmoniously enforced.\n\n 4. \nThe validity of the order in the light of the statute as interpreted.\n The order is in the margin. \n2\n The main insistence is \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 492]\n\u00a0\n that there was no power after recognizing the existence of competition and the right to charge a lesser rate to the competitive point than to intermediate points to do more than fix a reasonable rate to the intermediate points; that is to say, that under the power transferred to it by the section as amended, the Commission was limited to\n___ ern points of shipment which are higher to intermediate points in Canada and in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, California, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington, and other states east thereof, than to Pacific coast terminals.\n Full investigation of the matters and things involved in these petitions, in so far as they concern westbound commodity rates, having been had,\n It is ordered, That for the purposes of the disposition of these applications, the United States shall be divided into five zones, as described in the following manner:\n (The transcontinental group hereinafter described are as specified in R. H. Countiss, agent's transcontinental Tariff I. C. C. No. 929.)\n Zone No. 1 comprises all that portion of the United States lying west of a line called Line No. 1, which extends in a general southerly direction from a point immediately east of Grand Portage, minnesota; thence southwesterly, along the northwestern shore of Lake Superior, to a point immediately east of Superior, Wisconsin; thence southerly, along the eastern boundary of Transcontinental Group F, to the intersection of the Arkansas and Oklahoma state line; thence along the west side of the Kansas City Southern Railway to the Gulf of Mexico.\n Zone No. 2 embraces all territory in the United States lying east of Line No. 1 and west of a line called Line No. 2, which begins at the international boundary between the United States and Canada, immediately west of Cockburn island, in Lake Huron; passes westerly through the Straits of Mackinaw; southerly, through Lake Michigan to its southern boundary; follows the west boundary of Transcontinental Group C to Paducah, Kentucky; thence follows the east side of the Illinois Central Railroad to the southern boundary of Transcontinental Group C; thence follows the east boundary of Group C. to the Gulf of Mexico.\n Zone No. 3 embraces all territory in the United States lying east of Line No. 2 and north of the south boundary of Transcontinental Group C, and on and west of Line No. 3, which is the Buffalo Pittsburg line from Buffalo, New York, to Wheeling, West Virginia, marking the western bound \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 493]\n\u00a0\n ascertaining the existence of competition, and to authorizing the carrier to meet it, without any authority to do more than exercise its general powers concerning the reasonableness of rates at all points. But this proposition is directly in conflict with the statute as we have construed it, and with the plain purpose and intent manifested by its enactment. To uphold the proposition it would be necessary to say that the powers which were essential to the vivification and beneficial realization of the authority transferred had evaporated in the process of transfer, and hence that the power perished as the result of the act by which it was conferred. As the prime\n___ ary of Trunk Line Freight Association territory; thence follows the Ohio river to Huntington, West Virginia.\n Zone No. 4 embraces all territory in the United States east of Line No. 3 and north of the south boundary of Transcontinental Group C.\n Zone No. 5 embraces all territory south and east of Transcontinental Group C.\n It is further ordered, (1) That those portions of the above-numbered applications that request authority to maintain higher commodity rates from points in Zone No. 1 to intermediate points than to Pacific coast terminals be, and the same are hereby, denied, effective November 15, 1911 ; (2) that petitioners herein be, and they are hereby, authorized to establish and maintain, effective November 15, 1911, commodity rates from all points in zones numbered 2, 3, and 4, as above defined, to points intermediate to Pacific coast terminals, that are higher to intermediate points than to Pacific coast terminals; provided, that the rates to intermediate points from points in zones numbered 2, 3, and 4 shall not exceed the rates on the same commodities from the same points of origin to the Pacific coast terminals by more than 7 per cent from points in Zone No. 2, 15 per cent from points in Zone No. 3, and 25 per cent from points in Zone No. 4.\n The commission does not hereby approve any rates that may be established under this authority, all such rates being subject to complaint, investigation, and correction if they conflict with any other provisions of the act.\n By the Commission:\n [Seal.]\n Judson C. Clements,\n Chairman. \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 494]\n\u00a0\n object of the transfer was to vest the Commission, within the scope of the discretion imposed, and subject, in the nature of things, to the limitations arising from the character of the duty exacted and flowing from the other provisions of the act, with authority to consider competitive conditions and their relation to persons and places, necessarily there went with the power the right to do that by which alone it could be exerted, and therefore a consideration of the one and the other, and the establishment of the basis by percentages, was within the power granted. As will be seen by the order, and as we have already said, for the purpose of the percentages established zones of influence were adopted, and the percentages fixed as to such zones varied or fluctuated upon the basis of the influence of the competition in the designated areas. As we have pointed out, though somewhat modified, the zones as thus selected by the Commission were in substance the same as those previously fixed by the carriers as the basis of the rate making which was included in the tariffs which were under investigation, and therefore we may put that subject out of view. Indeed, except as to questions of power, there is no contention in the argument as to the inequality of the zones or percentages, or as to any undue preference or discrimination resulting from the action taken. But be this as it may, in view of the findings of the Commission as to the system of rates prevailing in the tariffs which were before it, of the inequalities and burdens engendered by such system, of the possible aggrandizement unnaturally beyond the limits produced by competition in favor of the competitive points and against other points by the tariff in question,-facts which we accept, and which indeed are unchallenged,-we see no ground for saying that the order was not sustained by the facts upon which it was based, or that it exceeded the powers which the statute conferred, or transcended the limits of the sound legal discretion which it lodged in \n\n[234 U.S. 476, 495]\n\u00a0\n the Commission when acting upon the subject before it.\n It results that the Commerce Court, in enjoining the order of the Commission, was wrong, and its decree to that end must therefore by reversed, and the case be remanded to the proper District Court, with directions to dismiss the bill for want of equity.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Interstate Commerce Commission v.

The first trial resulted in a judgment for the United States, which was reversed by the circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit. 93 C. C. A. 322, 167 Fed. \n\n[234 U.S. 36, 39]\n\u00a0\n 922. On new trial judgment directed in favor of the defendants was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals (113 C. C. A. 512, 193 Fed. 644), and the case is brought here.\n It appears that on the 25th of August, 1902, the United States called for bids for dredging in San Pablo bay. On September 30, 1902, Axman submitted his proposal to furnish all the plant, labor, and materials for the work. On November 21, 1902, a written contract was entered into between Axman and the United States for the work. Axman was to do such dredging in the bay as might be required by the government engineer, in accordance with certain specifications, for the sum of 11.44 cents per cubic yard. The specifications, which were made a part of the contract, contained, among others, the following paragraphs:\n'35. The shoal to be dredged is in San Pablo bay, California, is about 5 miles in length, and has a least depth of 19 feet at low water. It extends from Pinole point to Lone Tree point, and is distant 1 1\/4 to 1 1\/2 statute miles N. W. of the points referred to. The average depth of the excavation is about 9 feet.\n\n'36. The work to be done is to excavate a channel through the shoal, to have a bottom width of 300 feet; a depth of 30 feet at mean low water, and a length of about 27,000 feet; to deposit the spoil as near the south shore as practicable, within lines drawn between Pinole point and Lone Tree point, at such places as may be designated by the engineer officer in charge; and to impound the material behind bulkheads or dikes of suitable construction, subject to approval by the engineer officer in charge, which must be built and maintained by and at the expense of the contractor during the life of the contract.'\n\n'39. All dredging material is to be deposited within the limits of the area described in paragraph 36. The method of deposit will be subject to approval by the engineer officer in charge.' \n\n[234 U.S. 36, 40]\n\u00a0\n\n'31. The contractor will be required to commence work under the contract within sixty days after the date of notification of approval of the contract by the Chief of Engineers, U. S. Army, to prosecute the said work with faithfulness and energy, and to complete it within twenty-eight ( 28) months after the date of commencement.'\n\n\n'46. The work must progress at the rate of at least 100,000 cubic yards per month, and to entitle the contractor to the monthly payments provided for in paragraph 30 of these specifications, an average of not less than 100,000 cubic yards per month must have been dredged and deposited; the calculation of averages to be made from the day on which the contract requires the work to be commenced.'\n\n A place for the building of the bulkhead was designated in accordance with paragraph 36 of the specifications, and Axman built a bulkhead 2,400 feet long, consisting of two arms, one of 1,800 feet and one of 600 feet. The outlines of the channel to be dredged were also indicated. Axman began work and continued intermittently until December 24, 1903, up to which date he had removed 196,000 cubic yards, but had not in any month removed 100,000 cubic yards. It appears that the barges in Axman's outfit were of such draft that they were unable to get behind the bulkhead except at high tide; that he applied to the engineer officer in charge to be allowed to dump the spoil on the north side of the channel or down at 'The Sisters,' but permission was refused him so to do. This place is the one where the material was subsequently dumped when the contract was relet.\n Paragraph 4 of the contract provides:\n'4. If, in any event, the party of the second part shall delay or fail to commence with the delivery of the material or the performance of the work on the day specified herein, or shall, in the judgment of the engineer in charge, fail to prosecute faithfully and diligently the \n\n[234 U.S. 36, 41]\n\u00a0\n work in accordance with the specifications and requirements of this contract, then, in either case, the party of the first part, or his successors legally appointed, shall have power, with the sanction of the Chief of Engineers, to annul this contract by giving notice in writing to that effect to the party (or parties, or either of them) of the second part, and upon the giving of such notice all payments to the party or parties of the second part under this contract shall cease, and all money or reserve percentage due or to become due the said party or parties of the second part, by reason of this contract, shall be retained by the party of the first part until the final completion and acceptance of the work herein stipulated to be done; and the United States shall have the right to recover from the party of the second part whatever sums may be expended by the party of the first part in completing the said contract in excess of the price herein stipulated to be paid the party of the second part for completing the same, and also all costs of inspection and superintendence incurred by the said United States, in excess of those payable by the said United States during the period herein allowed for the completion of the contract by the party of the second part; and the party of the first part may deduct all the above-mentioned sums out of or from the money or reserve percentage retained as aforesaid; and upon the giving of the said notice the party of the first part shall be authorized to proceed to secure the performance of the work or delivery of the materials, by contract or otherwise, in accordance with law.'\n\n There are other paragraphs permitting the Chief of Engineers, if he sees fit, to employ additional plant or purchase materials, etc., to insure the completion of the work within the time specified, charging the cost thereof to the contractor; such provision, however, not to be construed so as to affect the right of the government to annul the contract. The government, on the ground that Axman \n\n[234 U.S. 36, 42]\n\u00a0\n had failed to comply with the requirements of the specifications, proceeded under the provisions of paragraph 4, wherein it will be seen it was stipulated that the United States might have the right to recover from the party of the second part whatever sums might be expended by the party of the first part in completing the contract.\n When the contract was relet it was advertised in the alternative, giving the contractor the right to deposit spoil where Axman was required to deposit it within lines drawn between Pinole point and Lone Tree point at such places as might be designated by the engineer officer, and to impound the material behind bulkheads of suitable construction, subject to the approval of the engineer officer, to be built and maintained at the expense of the contractor, or to deposit the spoil in water exceeding 50 feet in depth lying within the area bounded by lines drawn from The Sisters to Point San Pablo, thence to Marin Islands, and thence back to The Sisters. The bid accepted and the contract made provided for the deposit of the spoil in deep water at The Sisters. At the trial the government offered evidence of witnesses as to the fairness of the price paid the North American Dredging Company, the new contractor, under the relet contract, and as to whether it cost more to dredge and dump the spoil behind the line drawn between Pinole point and Lone Tree point than to dredge and dump in deep water. All of the opinion evidence offered by the government was received by the court under objection, and at the conclusion of the case ruled out, and the jury instructed to render a verdict for the defendants.\n It is thus apparent that the real question in the case is whether the contract relet for the completion of the work under paragraph 4 of the original contract was a contract for work for which Axman was bound and which he had failed to carry out, or whether it was a different contract, and therefore one for which Axman and his surety cannot \n\n[234 U.S. 36, 43]\n\u00a0\n be held, and which cannot be used for the measure of recovery for breach of the original contract.\n The government insists that the main purpose of the original contract was to secure the dredging of the channel, and that the place of dumping the spoil was but incidental. The contract, however, does not so read. It specifically made the place of dumping the spoil an essential and particular term of the contract. It is not necessary to inquire into the reason which actuated the government in making this requirement. It may be that it desired the spoil to be retained at a place outside of the channel, and that such retention was a better way of doing the work than to deposit the spoil in deep water. It is enough to say that the contract, part of which we have heretofore set forth, specifically provided for dumping the spoil behind the bulkhead. As we have said, the engineer refused permission to dump the spoil at a place other than that designated in the specifications. This position of the engineer was warranted by the terms of the contract, for by paragraph 36 of the specifications the depositing of material and impounding it behind bulkheads, as provided in the contract, were made an assential part of the work to be done, and it is provided by specification 38 that material deposited otherwise than as specified will not be paid for, and by paragraph 39 that all dredged material was to be deposited within the area specified in paragraph 36, and by paragraph 53 that all material must be excavated and deposited under the supervision of the engineer officer in charge. It therefore follows that not only was Axman to dredge the channel as required by the contract, but he was to deposit the spoil as therein specified. Dredging the channel would not be enough to show performance of his contract, unless he complied with the other material requirement as to the deposit of the spoil. The new contract contained a different stipulation as to the dumping of the spoil. Upon the showing made in this case we think the change in the \n\n[234 U.S. 36, 44]\n\u00a0\n place of dumping the spoil was very material, and could not be made consistently with the terms of the agreement under which Axman undertook to perform the work or be liable as stipulated in paragraph 4.\n Both sides refer to the case of United States v. McMullen, \n222 U.S. 460\n, 56 L. ed. 269, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 128. In that case a suit was brought upon a contract and bond, the contract providing for certain dredging. The contractor asked for leave to dump the spoil in deep water instead of on shore, which was at first refused, but afterwards granted. The contractor, however, failed to do the work and abandoned it. The Navy Department declared the contract void, and, after advertising, entered into a new contract. The defense principally made and treated of in the opinion of the court rested upon the alleged extension of time, which, it was contended, worked a discharge of the surety. After disposing of that question in favor of the government, this court said (p. 471):\n'The objection that the second contractor does not appear to have completed the work intended to be accomplished by the first, that is, to have made a channel of a certain depth, does not impress us. The first contract was for certain work for a certain object, but limited and subject to change as the appropriations might require. The second was for the same on the same plans and specifications, the only difference being in the parties, the price, and the liberty given to the second contractor to dump in deep water, which diminished the cost. In the first contract the government reserved an absolute right of choice in this regard. Whether the object of the contract was attained is immaterial, so long as the work done towards it was work that the first contractor had agreed to perform.'\n\n We thus observe that in the McMullen Case it was found that the liberty given to the second contractor to dump in deep water did not change the contract, because in the \n\n[234 U.S. 36, 45]\n\u00a0\n first contract the government reserved an absolute right of choice in this regard. In the present case there was no such right of choice. The place of dumping spoil was made, as we have said, a specific requirement of the contract. Under  6 such changes as are here involved must be agreed upon in writing by the contracting parties, the agreement setting forth clearly reasons for the change, giving quantity and prices, to take effect only upon the approval of the Secretary of War. Minor changes are provided for in  58 of the specifications, but clearly such an important change as this one has proven to be is not of that character.\n In the McMullen Case, in treating of the right reserved in the first contract giving the government an absolute choice of the dumping ground, it was concluded, 'whether the object of the contract was attained is immaterial, so long as the work done towards it was work that the first contractor had agreed to perform.' We are clearly of the opinion in this case that the work done under the second contract was not the work which the first contractor had agreed to perform. While it is true it accomplished the dredging of the channel in the same bay, it did this with a disposition of the spoil not permitted under the first contract, and in a material matter was different from the contract first entered upon.\n We reach the conclusion that the Circuit Court of Appeals rightly decided this case, and its judgment is accordingly affirmed. \n\n\n\n","236":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. BEATTY(1914)\nNo. 555\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 463, 464]\n\u00a0\n Solicitor General Davis and Mr. W. C. Herron for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. E. Hilton Jackson, D. C. O'Flaherty and E. H. Jackson for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was a statutory proceeding by the United States to acquire for public use, by condemnation under judicial process, certain land in Warren county, in the western district of Virginia. It was based upon two congressional enactments: One, a provision in the army appropriation act of March 3, 1911 (36 Stat. at L. 1037, 1049, chap. 209), appropriating 'not to exceed two hundred thousand dollars for the purchase of land accessible to the horse-raising section of the state of Virginia, for the assembling, grazing, and training of horses purchased for the mounted service;' and the other, the act of August 1, 1888 (25 Stat. at L. 357, chap. 728, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2516) which reads as follows:\n'That in every case in which the Secretary of the Treasury, or any other officer of the government, has been, or hereafter shall be, authorized to procure real estate for the erection of a public building or for other public uses, he shall be, and hereby is, authorized to acquire the same for the United States by condemnation, under judicial process, whenever in his opinion, it is necessary or advantageous to the government to do so; and the United States circuit or district courts of the district wherein such real estate is located shall have jurisdiction of proceedings for such condemnation, and it shall be the duty of the Attorney General of the United States, upon every application of the Secretary of the Treasury, under this act, or such other officer, to cause proceedings to be commenced \n\n[232 U.S. 463, 465]\n\u00a0\n for condemnation, within thirty days from the receipt of the application at the Department of Justice.\n\n'Sec. 2. The practice, pleadings, forms, and modes of proceeding in causes arising under the provisions of this act, shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice, pleadings, forms, and proceedings existing at the time in like causes in the courts of record of the state within which such circuit or district courts are held, any rule of the court to the contrary notwithstanding.'\n\n The proceeding was initiated, under the Attorney General's direction, by a petition filed in the district court of the United States for the district wherein the land is situate, praying for the appointment of commissioners, according to the law of the state, to ascertain the just compensation to be paid. Due notice having been given, the owners appeared and interposed objections to the proceeding; all of which having been considered and overruled, an order was entered appointing commissioners agreeably to the prayer in the petition and to the state statute. The commissioners viewed the land, heard the evidence, fixed the compensation at upwards of $30,000, and returned into the district court a report of their proceedings and ascertainment. Exceptions to the report were filed by the owners, and, after a hearing, were overruled; whereupon a judgment was entered, confirming the report. 198 Fed. 284. The owners carried the cause to the circuit court of appeals, and that court, being of opinion that the 7th Amendment to the Constitution, preserving the right of trial by jury, embraces such a proceeding, reversed the judgment, with a direction that the compensation be determined upon a trial before a common- law jury. 122 C. C. A. 16, 203 Fed. 620. The United States then sued out the present writ of error, and subsequently presented a petition praying that the judgment of the circuit court of appeals be reviewed upon writ of certiorari, if the writ of error should be regarded as premature. \n\n[232 U.S. 463, 466]\n\u00a0\n Consideration of this petition was postponed to the hearing upon the writ of error.\n As the proceeding was begun by the United States, and the amount in controversy greatly exceeds $1,000, besides costs, there can be no doubt that the case is one in which a final judgment in the circuit court of appeals may be reviewed by this court upon a writ of error. Judicial Code ,  128, 241 [36 Stat. at L. 1133, 1157, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, pp. 193, 229]. But the judgment rendered in that court is not final either in form or substance. It reverses the judgment in the district court, vacates the commissioners' award, and requires that the compensation be ascertained anew through a trial by jury. Thus, it puts at large the principal matter in controversy, and refers it to the district court for solution in the mode indicated. It is therefore essentially interlocutory, and cannot be the subject of a writ of error from this court. Tracy v. Holcombe, 24 How. 426, 16 L. ed. 742; Macfarland v. Brown, \n187 U.S. 239\n, 47 L. ed. 159, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 105; United States v. Krall, \n174 U.S. 385\n, 43 L. ed. 1017, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 712; German Nat. Bank v.

If it be erroneous, and ultimately operates prejudicially to the United States, the latter may, of course, secure its correction by a writ of error from this court; but not until the case proceeds to a final judgment in the circuit court of appeals. United States v. Denver & R. G. R. Co. \n191 \nU.S. 84, 93\n, 48 S. L. ed. 106, 109, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 33; Messenger v. Anderson, \n225 \nU.S. 436, 444\n, 56 S. L. ed. 1152, 1156, 32 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 593, and cases cited. Being premature, the writ of error must be dismissed.\n The power conferred upon this court by  240 of the Judicial Code to require, by writ of certiorari, that cases in the circuit courts of appeals be certified here for review and determination, is plainly confined to that class of cases in which, according to the provisions of  128 and 241, the final decrees and judgments of those courts are not reviewable upon appeal or writ of error; that is to say, if a case be one which may come here under  241 by \n\n[232 U.S. 463, 467]\n\u00a0\n appeal or writ of error after a final decree or judgment in the circuit court of appeals, it is not a case which may be brought here by certiorari under  240. It is not intended that these two modes of exercising appellate authority over the circuit courts of appeals, one upon appeal or writ of error and the other upon certiorari, shall be coexistent as respects any case or class of cases, but rather that the former, where it exists at all, shall be exclusive. This is fully recognized in Lau Ow Bew v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 47, 58\n, 36 S. L. ed. 340, 344, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 517; American Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co. \n148 \nU.S. 372, 385\n, 37 S. L. ed. 486, 491, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 758, and Forsyth v. Hammond, \n166 \nU.S. 506, 513\n, 514 S., 41 L. ed. 1095, 1099, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 665.\n This case is not within any of the classes enumerated in the latter part of  128, and the amount in controversy is greatly in excess of $1, 000, besides costs; so it is a case, as before indicated, in which a final judgment by the circuit court of appeals may be reviewed by this court upon writ of error under  241. And from this it follows that it is not a case which may be brought here by certiorari under  240.\n We do not overlook  262 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1162, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 235], formerly  716 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 580), which empowers this court to issue all writs, not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law. No doubt, this provision contemplates the employment of the writ of certiorari in instances not covered by  240, and affords ample authority for using the writ as an auxiliary process, and, whenever there is imperative necessity therefor, as a means of correcting excesses of jurisdiction, of giving full force and effect to existing appellate authority, and of furthering justice in other kindred ways. American Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co. \n148 \nU.S. 372, 380\n, 37 S. L. ed. 486, 489, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 758; Re Chetwood, \n165 \nU.S. 443, 462\n, 41 S. L. ed. 782, 788, 17 Sup. Ct.

But it may not be used under this provision as a sub- \n\n[232 U.S. 463, 468]\n\u00a0\n stitute for an appeal or writ of error to correct mere errors committed in the exercise of a lawful jurisdiction. American Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co. \n148 \nU.S. 372, 385\n, 37 S. L. ed. 486, 491, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 758; Re Tampa Suburban R. Co. \n168 U.S. 583\n, 42 L. ed. 589, 18 Sup. Ct.

Whether the 7th Amendment, preserving the right of trial by jury, embraces a proceeding to condemn land for public use, was one of the questions arising for decision in the circuit court of appeals. In deciding it, the court but exercised an undoubted jurisdiction, and this whether the decision was right or wrong. If wrong, it was a mere error, and the landowners, having invited it, will not be heard to complain. The jury may award a less compensation than did the commissioners, and, if so, the United States will hardly be in a position to complain. Interlocutory rulings not infrequently become of no importance by reason of the final result or of intervening matters, and that may be true here. But if the decision ultimately operates prejudicially to the United States, it can be reviewed, and, if need be, corrected upon a writ of error from the final judgment, as before indicated. In this situation we perceive no adequate reason for resorting to the writ of certiorari under  262.\n Writ of error dismissed.\n Petition for certiorari denied. \n\n\n\n","237":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. BENNETT(1914)\nNo. 629\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1914\n\n\n\n ON A CERTIFICATE from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit presenting the following questions:\n I. Does the tax purporting to be imposed by  37 of the act of Congress, approved August 5, 1909, apply to the use of a foreign-built yacht owned by a citizen of the United States, when such yacht, for a period of more than one year prior to September 1, 1909, and to the levy of such tax, was used wholly outside of the limits and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Answered in the affirmative.\n II. Did the tax purporting to be imposed by said act of Congress operate retrospectively, so as to be payable on September 1, 1909, in respect of the year then ended, or only prospectively, so as to become first due and payable on September 1, 1910? Answered in the affirmative.\n III. Did the whole amount of the tax purporting to be imposed by said act of Congress become due and payable on September 1, 1909, or only such proportion thereof as the time during which the act was in force at that date bears to the whole year? Answered in the affirmative; the whole tax.\n IV. Has Congress the power to levy a tax upon the use by a citizen of the United States of a yacht which is not actually, and since the year 1904 was not at any time, used within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, and which has its permanent situs in a foreign country? Answered in the affirmative. \n\n[232 U.S. 299, 300]\n\u00a0\n V. Does said act of Congress, by purporting to impose a tax upon the use of foreign-built yachts alone, provide a valid tax, or a valid classification for purposes of taxation, within the power to lay and collect taxes delegated to Congress by the Constitution of the United States? Answered in the affirmative.\n VI. Is the tax purporting to be imposed by said act of Congress in conflict with the requirement of due process of law contained in the 5th article of Amendment to the Constitution of the United States? Answered in the negative.\n VII. Is the United States entitled to recover interest upon the tax imposed upon the use of foreign-built yachts in and by  37 of the tariff act of August 5, 1909? Answered in the affirmative. Assistant Attorney General Adkins and Mr. Karl W. Kirchwey for the United States.\n Mr. William D. Guthrie for James Gordon Bennett.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n So far as we deem it material to the question we are called upon to answer, the certificate in this case is as follows: \n\n[232 U.S. 299, 301]\n\u00a0\n 'The United States, plaintiff below, sued out a writ of error to this court to review a judgment of the United States circuit court for the southern district of New York in the above-entitled cause, entered on July 6, 1911, dismissing the amended complaint of the United States in an action brought against the defendant below to recover the tax imposed by  37 of the tariff act of August 5, 1909 (chap. 6, 36 Stat. at L. 112, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1197), for the year ended September 1, 1909, upon the use of the foreign-built yacht 'Lysistrata,' owned by the defendant.'\n After reciting the averment as to the assessment of the tax by the collector, amounting to $13,601, and the failure of the defendant to pay, his citizenship and ownership of the yacht, and the conformity of the assessment to the statute, the certificate states that there was a prayer for the recovery of the amount with interest. It then proceeds to state the answer of the defendant, setting up the nonregistry and nonenrolment of the yacht, that she enjoyed no protection or privileges of any kind under the laws of the United States, and that the yacht since 1904 'had not been within the jurisdiction of the United States, but had had a permanent situs within the jurisdiction of the Republic of France.' The certificate then proceeds to state the facts as to ownership of other yachts in the United States in the exact words used in the answers in previous cases which we have this day decided, and upon which the want of due process of law was set up. Then the certificate declares the United States demurred to this answer, and that this demurrer was overruled, and the United States electing to plead no further, there was judgment rejecting its claim, and that error was then prosecuted to the circuit court of appeals by the United States. The seven questions propounded are the equivalent of the questions in the Goelet Cases, just decided [\n232 U.S. 293\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431], except there is no question asked concerning the power to tax under the statute in case of the permanent domicil of \n\n[232 U.S. 299, 302]\n\u00a0\n the owner in a foreign country, which was the basis of the decision in the Goelet Cases because, as is shown by the certificate, there was no assertion or proof that there was a permanent foreign domicil of the owner in this case. So that the first question in this case concerns the liability of a citizen of the United States having a domicil therein, for a tax on a yacht owned and used during the taxing period outside of the United States, and is as follows: 'I. Does the tax purporting to be imposed by  37 of the act of Congress, approved August 5, 1909, apply to the use of a foreign-built yacht owned by a citizen of the United States, when such yacht, for a period of more than one year prior to September 1, 1909, and to the levy of such tax, was used wholly outside of the limits and territorial jurisdiction of the United States?' And if this question is answered in the affirmative, then the duty will arise of deciding whether, because of that aspect, the act is repugnant to the due process clause of the Constitution, since in determining the constitutionality of the act in the previous cases we were not called upon to decide whether the due process clause of the 5th Amendment operates to prevent the levy of such a tax.\n The statute applies, since, under the construction we have given it, it clearly establishes three standards as the basis of the excise duty which it imposes; citizenship and domicil within the United States, control by ownership or charter of a foreign-built yacht within the terms of the statute, and its use by the owner during the taxing period. But it said that as in any event the use which the statute taxes is solely a use within the United States, therefore the statute does not embrace this case, since the finding establishes that the yacht whose use is here taxed was wholly used and located outside of the territorial limits of the United States. We fail, however, to find in the provisions of the statute any language which would justify our affixing to the word 'use' the restricted sense upon which \n\n[232 U.S. 299, 303]\n\u00a0\n the proposition is based. On the contrary, the use provided for in the statute is unqualified, is generic, and must be enforced in that sense if the statute is to be given its plain meaning. It is true that in deciding a previous case we held that the statute would not be construed without clear intendment manifested to that effect as including a tax on a eitizen permanently domiciled outside of the geographical limits of the United States. But that ruling was based upon the proposition that as a taxing statute was usually confined to persons within the territorial jurisdiction of a taxing authority, and to do otherwise would be exceptional, unless such view was compelled by its terms, the statute here involved ought not to be construed as having been adopted to accomplish such unusual and strange result. The directly opposite is here applicable, since it is usual, where the taxing power is called into play as to an individual domiciled within the territorial limits of the taxing authority, to cause the manifestation of taxing power to be coterminous with the taxing authority of the government levying the tax. Therefore it follows that the principle of interpretation previously applied has no possible application to the construction of the word 'use,' which we are now considering. The difference between the two rules is that which must exist between not assuming in the one case that something exceptional has been done, and taking for granted in the other that a power expressed embraces that which is usual and incidental to its exertion. The argument that the statute should not be construed as applying to the use of a yacht wholly beyond the territorial limits of the United States, since if so interpreted it would be repugnant to the Constitution, rests upon what in effect is a misconception of the elementary rule of interpretation that where there are two possible constructions of a statute, one of which will give rise to grave doubt as to its constitutionality, and the other avoids such question, the latter will be adopted. \n\n[232 U.S. 299, 304]\n\u00a0\n The foundation of this is the possibility of two constructions, and the existence of the grave doubt as to constitutionality. To apply the rule in a case like this, where neither of such conditions exists, would be to cause an imaginary doubt as to the constitutionality of a statute to render it necessary to give to the statute a wholly fictitious and unauthorized meaning; that is to say, the effect of adopting the contention would be but to declare that in every case where the construction of a statute was in issue its misconstruction would become necessary if only it was asserted that, if rightly construed, repugnancy to the Constitution would result. We come, then, to consider the contention that when the statute is correctly interpreted there will arise a conflict between its provisions and the safeguards of the Constitution, not only for the purpose of demonstrating the unsoundness of the assertion of constitutional right, but also with the object of making it clear that even if the statute were susceptible of a different construction by resort to subtlety of reasoning or refinement of distinction, there is nothing of such gravity in the asserted constitutional question as to lead us to resort to such means in order to avoid giving to the statute the meaning which we have affixed to it, resulting from its unambiguous text.\n As not even an intimation is made in the argument that any limitation on the taxing power of Congress in this regard can be deduced from the provisions of the Constitution concerning the taxing authority, and as the only limiting provision relied upon is the due process clause of the 5th Amendment, it follows in this case, as it did in the Billings Case [\n232 U.S. 261\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 421], that, after all, the assertion of want of power must rest upon the assumption that an attempt by the United States to tax the property of a citizen residing within its jurisdiction, where such property is beyond the territorial limits of the United States, is so in conflict with obvious principles of justice, and so inconsistent with \n\n[232 U.S. 299, 305]\n\u00a0\n every conception of representative and free government, as to cause the exertion of power to come within the limitations of the due process clause of the 5th Amendment. We might well leave the answer to the contention when it is thus rightly understood to result from its mere statement, from the obvious misconceptions as to the nature and extent of the authority of a sovereign although it be a representative government, and from a true appreciation of the privileges as well as the duties arising from citizenship, and the past and recent exertions by Congress of the very taxing authority which is now challenged. (See act of June 30, 1864, 13 Stat. at L. 281, chap. 173.) We do not, however, leave the contentions to be destroyed by their own weakness, but come briefly to consider the authorities which it is insisted maintain their correctness, and to point out the error of the reasoning upon which their asserted applicability is based. We do not cite or review the cases relied on because we concede that the doctrine which it is asserted they decided is elementary, and in fact is the settled rule in this court. The principle of the cases is thus stated in the argument: 'It is a settled rule of constitutional law that the power to tax depends upon jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the tax. A long line of unbroken authority illustrates this firmly established doctrine in its various aspects, and although the cases have all arisen under state tax laws, their reasoning is applicable to and controlling in the case of a Federal tax act.' But the misapprehension consists not in a misconception as to what the cases relied on decided, but in taking for granted that because the doctrine stated has been applied and enforced in many decisions with respect to the taxing power of the states, that the same principle is applicable to and controlling as to the United States in the exercise of its powers. The confusion results from not observing that the rule applied in the cases relied upon to many forms of exertion of state taxing power is based on \n\n[232 U.S. 299, 306]\n\u00a0\n the limitations on state authority to tax resulting from the distribution of powers ordained by the Constitution. In other words, the whole argument proceeds upon the mistaken supposition, which is sometimes indulged in, that the calling into being of the government under the Constitution had the effect of destroying obvious powers of government instead of preserving and distributing such powers. The application to the states of the rule of due process relied upon comes from the fact that their spheres of activity are enforced and protected by the Constitution, and therefore it is impossible for one state to reach out and tax property in another without violating the Constitution, for where the power of the one ends the authority of the other begins. But this has no application to the government of the United States so far as its admitted taxing power is concerned. It is coextensive with the limits of the United States; it knows no restriction except where one is expressed in or arises from the Constitution, and therefore embraces all the attributes which appertain to sovereignty in the fullest sence. Indeed, the existence of such a wide power is the essential resultant of the limitation restricting the states within their allotted spheres, for if it were not so, then government in the plenary and usual acceptation of that word would have no existence. Because the limitations of the Constitution are barriers bordering the states and preventing them from transcending the limits of their authority, and thus destroying the rights of other states, and at the same time saving their rights from destruction by the other states, in other words, of maintaining and preserving the rights of all the states, affords no ground for constructing an imaginary constitutional barrier around the exterior confines of the United States for the purpose of shutting that government off from the exertion of powers which inherently belong to it by virtue of its sovereignty. But it is said in the decided cases relied upon, the principle which was an- \n\n[232 U.S. 299, 307]\n\u00a0\n nounced was that the power to tax was limited by the capacity of the taxing government to afford that benefit and protection which is the true basis of the right to tax, and which causes, therefore, taxation, where such capacity to confer benefit and afford protection does not exist, to be a mere arbitrary and unwarranted burden. But here again the confusion of thought consists in mistaking the scope and extent of the sovereign power of the United States as a nation, and its relation to its citizens, and their relations to it. It presumes that government does not, by its very nature, benefit the citizen and his property wherever found. Indeed, the argument, while holding on to citizenship, belittles and destroys its advantages and blessings by denying the possession by government of an essential power required to make citizenship completely beneficial.\n Concluding from what we have just said that the first question must be answered in the affirmative, it follows from the considerations just stated and the views which we have expressed in the previous cases as to the operation and constitutionality of the act in other respects, that the remaining questions must be answered as follows: The second, Yes; the third, Yes, the whole tax; the fourth, Yes; the fifth, Yes; the sixth, No; the seventh, relating to interest, Yes. \n\n[232 U.S. 299, 308]\n\u00a0\n As by these answers the right to impose and collect the tax under the facts stated will be established, in view of what we shall say in a case between the same parties which follows this, we think it proper to observe that nothing in our reply to these questions is to be so construed as to deprive the court below of the power to take such steps as it may deem necessary to avoid injustice if it should be deemed that by some mistake of fact such a result might occur. The answers to the questions will be certified in accordance with the directions above given.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","238":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Guthrie for James Gordon Bennett.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court.\n The certificate discloses that this case involves the right of the United States to recover an excise duty levied under  37 of the tariff act of 1909 [36 Stat. at L. 112, chap. 6, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1197], which became due on the 1st of September, 1910, on the same yacht which was the subject of the duty becoming due in 1909, and which we have passed upon in the case just decided. All the statements as to the complaint and answer, the submission of the case by stipulation to the court without a jury, the judgment rejecting the claim of the United States, and the prosecution of error from the court below, are in substance like those stated in the case concerning the tax for 1910 between the United States and Goelet, this day decided [\n232 U.S. 293\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 431]. As the result of this situation the certificate recites, differing in that respect from the Bennett Case just previously decided [\n232 U.S. 299\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 433], the trial court made the following finding: 'Defendant is a citizen of the United States, and for some years past has been domiciled in and resident of the Republic of France.'\n Conformably to this finding the second question propounded by the court below in this case asks whether the act applies where the owner of the yacht, although a citizen, was permanently domiciled and residing in a foreign country for more than two years prior to Sep- \n\n[232 U.S. 308, 310]\n\u00a0\n tember 1, 1910, and to the levy of such tax. As for the reasons stated in the Goelet Case, such question was answered in the negative, it follows that a like reply must be made here, and therefore there is no need of replying to any of the other questions. In deciding the previous case between the same parties, we made a reservation concerning the power of the court below to deal with the former case in the future, because of the fact that the findings in this case are absolutely in conflict with the state of things exhibited in the previous Bennett Case. Our order will be, second question answered in the negative, and the other questions not answered.\n And it will be so certified. \n\n\n\n","239":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Billings.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n These two cases are controlled by the two cases between the same parties, just decided. In the case which is here on error, the suit was brought by the United States to recover the amount of the tax which became due upon the yacht Vanadis, on the 1st day of September, 1910, under the act of August 5th, 1909 [36 Stat. at L. 11, chap. 6, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 741], which was under consideration in the previous cases. The complaint, leaving aside some additional averments which it is unnecessary to refer to, was the same as the one in the cases already passed upon, and this is true also of the answer. The case \n\n[232 U.S. 289, 290]\n\u00a0\n by stipulation was submitted to the court without a jury, and the steps essential to save all the questions in the case were properly taken. The use of the vessel during the taxing period was shown. There was a judgment in favor of the United States for the amount of the tax, but against it for interest, and error was prosecuted from the circuit court of appeals to review that subject, and such case is here on certificate. Taking jurisdiction of both cases and treating them as one, as was done in the previous cases, and applying the conclusions in those cases expressed, to this, it results that the judgment below must be modified, so far as the interest is concerned, by allowing the claim of the United States in that respect, and in other respects it must be affirmed.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","240":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. BIRDSALL(1914)\nNo. 727\nArgued: February 25, 1914Decided: April 6, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 223, 224]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney Generals Wallace and Denison for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Charles W. Mullan and H. B.

There were two indictments against the defendant Birdsall (which were consolidated), charging him with having given to Brents and Van Wert, respectively, a bribe in violation of  39 of the Criminal Code [35 Stat. at L. 1096, chap. 321, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1600]. The indictments against Brents and Van Wert were for accepting the bribes in violation of  117. Demurrer to each indictment, upon the ground that it charged no offense, was sustained by the district court. 206 Fed. 818. The cases are brought here under the criminal appeals act. 34 Stat. at L. 1246, chap. 2564.\n In view of the nature of the question presented, it is not necessary to consider the indictments separately. According to the allegations, Birdsall was attorney for certain persons who, on indictment for unlawfully selling \n\n[233 U.S. 223, 228]\n\u00a0\n liquor to Indians, had pleaded guilty and had been sentenced at the April term, 1910. Application had then been made to the judge of the court for a reduction or suspension of the sentences, and it was also stated that an effort would be made to obtain a commutation by Executive action. Brents and Van Wert were special officers, duly appointed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, under the authority of the Secretary of the Interior, for the suppression of the liquor traffic among the Indians. It was averred that by the regulations and established requirements of the Department of the Interior they were charged with the duty of informing and advising the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, either directly or through other subordinates, concerning all matters connected with the conviction and punishment of persons violating the laws of the United States in reference to the liquor traffic affecting the Indians, and particularly 'to inform the said Commissioner whether or not the effective suppression of the liquor traffic with and among Indians would be furthered or prejudiced by Executive or judicial clemency in any particular case.'\n After referring to the conviction and sentence of the persons named, and to the application then made to the judge for a reduction or suspension of sentence, each indictment continued as follows:\n'That then and there the judge of the said court announced that he would not change or reduce or suspend the said sentences or any part thereof, unless a recommendation to that effect was made to him by the said Commissioner of Indian Affairs; and the United States attorney in the aforesaid district announced that he would not recommend a commutation or other Executive clemency unless a recommendation to that effect was made to him by the said Commissioner of Indian Affairs.\n\n'That then and there, and during all the dates and times herein mentioned, it was and long had been the \n\n[233 U.S. 223, 229]\n\u00a0\n settled usage and practice for the United States judges in determining upon sentences and upon the applications for changes, reductions, or suspensions thereof, to consult the United States attorney, and either directly or through him the administrative officer charged with the enforcement of the laws in question, including laws for the suppression of the liquor traffic with and among the Indians,-the said Commissioner of Indian Affairs; and likewise it had been and was the settled usage and practice of the President, in the exercise of his power of extending Executive clemency, to consult the Attorney General; and likewise it had been and was the settled usage and practice of the Attorney General, for the purpose of advising the President on the said subject, to consult with the United States attorney or other officer by whom the prosecution had been conducted. . . .\n\n'That then and there and that at all the times herein mentioned the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in the performance of his official duty, as provided by the rules and regulations and established usages and practices and requirements of the said Department of the Interior, and as provided by law, was charged with the duties of assisting in the enforcement of the laws of the United States in reference to the liquor traffic affecting Indians, and particularly with the duty, when requested so to do, of advising and making recommendations to any judge before whom any prosecutions on the said subject may have been tried, and the United States attorney or other officer by whom the said prosecution had been conducted, concerning the effect upon the enforcement of the said law of any proposed leniency or clemency in connection with the punishment of persons found guilty of offenses thereunder.'\n\n The indictments against Birdsall charged him with having given money to Brents and Van Wert with intent to influence their official action so that they would advise the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, contrary to the truth \n\n[233 U.S. 223, 230]\n\u00a0\n that upon facts officially known to them leniency should be granted to the persons who had been convicted and sentenced, as stated, and that in the interest of the enforcement of the laws the Commissioner should so recommend to the judge, the United States attorney, the Secretary of the Interior, the Attorney General, or the President. The indictments against Brents and Van Wert charged that they had received the money from Birdsall with the intent that their official action should be thus influenced.\n As the district court held that the acts charged did not fall within the condemnation of the statute, the court necessarily construed the statute, and the cases are properly here. United States v. Patten, \n226 \nU.S. 525, 535\n, 57 S. L. ed. 333, 339, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 325, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 141.\n Section 117 of the Criminal Code (35 Stat. at L. p. 1109, chap. 321, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1623), with respect to the acceptance of bribes, provides that 'whoever, being an officer of the United States, or a person acting for or on behalf of the United States, in any official capacity, under or by virtue of the authority of any department or office of the government thereof,' accepts money, etc., 'with intent to have his decision or action on any question, matter, cause, or proceeding which may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before him in his official capacity, or in his place of trust or profit, influenced thereby,' shall be punished as stated. Section 39 (id. p. 1096), as to bribe giving, uses similar language in defining the official relation of the recipient and the character of the action intended to be influenced; adding the words-'with intent to influence him to commit . . . any fraud . . . on the United States, or to induce him to do or omit to do any act in violation of his lawful duty.'\n Every action that is within the range of official duty comes within the purview of these sections. There was thus a legislative basis (United States v. George, \n228 \nU.S. 14, 22\n, 57 S. L. ed. 712, 715, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 412) for the charge in the present cases, if the action sought to be influenced was official action. To constitute \n\n[233 U.S. 223, 231]\n\u00a0\n it official action, it was not necessary that it should be prescribed by statute; it was sufficient that it was governed by a lawful requirement of the Department under whose authority the officer was acting (Rev. Stat.  161, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 80; Benson v. Henkel, \n198 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 49 S. L. ed. 919, 922, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 569; Haas v. Henkel, \n216 \nU.S. 462, 480\n, 54 S. L. ed. 569, 577, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249, 17 Ann. Cas. 1112). Nor was it necessary that the requirement should be prescribed by a written rule or regulation. It might also be found in an established usage which constituted the common law of the Department and fixed the duties of those engaged in its activities. United States v. Macdaniel, 7 Pet. 1, 14, 8 L. ed. 587, 592. In numerous instances, duties not completely defined by written rules are clearly established by settled practice, and action taken in the course of their performance must be regarded as within the provisions of the above-mentioned statutes against bribery. Haas v. Henkel, supra.\n We must assume, in view of the decision below, that the indictment sufficiently charged that the action of Brents and Van Wert, which it was sought to influence, was action in the course of duty so far as the regulations and usages of the Department could establish that duty.\n The question is whether the Department had authority to establish it. The district court held that it had no such power, and hence that the indictments charged no offense. The ruling was that there was 'no act of Congress conferring upon the Interior Department, or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, any duty whatever in regard to recommending to the executive or judicial departments of the government whether or not Executive or judicial clemency shall be extended to, or withheld from, any person who may be charged with, or convicted of, selling intoxicating liquors to Indians, or of any other offense against the United States.' 206 Fed. 818, 821.\n The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 'under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, and agreeably to such regulations as the President may prescribe,' is \n\n[233 U.S. 223, 232]\n\u00a0\n charged with 'the management of all Indian affairs and of all matters arising out of Indian relations' (Rev. Stat.  463, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 262). The object of the establishment of the office was to create an administrative agency with broad powers adequate to the execution of the policy of the government, as determined by the acts of Congress, with respect to the Indians under its guardianship. From an early day, Congress has prohibited the liquor traffic among the Indians, and it has been one of the important duties of the Indian Office to aid in the enforcement of this legislation. See act of June 30, 1834, chap. 161,  20, 4 Stat. at L. 729, 732; Rev. Stat.  2139-2141; act of July 23, 1892, chap. 234, 27 Stat. at L. 260; act of January 30, 1897, chap. 109, 29 Stat. at L. 506. It has furnished such aid by the detection of violations, by the collection of evidence, and by appropriate steps to secure the conviction and punishment of offenders. The regulations of the office, adopted under statutory authority (Rev. Stat.  465, 2058, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 264), have been explicit as to the duties of Indian agents in this respect. 1 In recent years, Congress has \n\n[233 U.S. 223, 233]\n\u00a0\n made special appropriations 'to enable the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, to take action to suppress the traffic of intoxicating liquors among Indians' (34 Stat. at L. 328, 1017, chaps. 3504, 2285;2 35 Stat. at L. 72, 782, chaps. 153, 263; 36 Stat. at L. 271, 1059, chaps. 140, 210; 37 Stat. at L. 519, chap. 388), and an organization of special officers and deputies, serving in various states, has been created in the Department. Through these efforts numerous convictions have been obtained. The results have been reported to Congress annually by the Commissioner,3 and the appropriations for the continuance of the service have been increased. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[233 U.S. 223, 234]\n\u00a0\n This being the character of the Department's work, it cannot be doubted that when persons who are convicted apply for Executive clemency the President is entitled to avail himself of the recommendations of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Commissioner. The information obtained by the Indian Office and its advice are always at his command. The President is entitled to know whether, in the judgment of the Secretary or the Commissioner, the granting of clemency will tend to promote or hinder the efforts of the Department. The action of these officers in thus advising the President plainly would be official action; but in so acting they would necessarily rely largely upon the reports and advice of subordinates in the department who were more directly acquainted with the existing conditions, the records of offenders, and the facts and circumstances of particular cases. For this reason, if for no other, it was within the competency of the office to establish regulations, and practices having the force of regulations, that all persons employed in its work should render to the Commissioner whenever requested true reports and give disinterested and honest advice upon the facts known to them with respect to the advisability of showing leniency to convicted violators of the law.\n Nor is there any ground for the conclusion that the President is limited to obtaining direct reports to himself in such matters. By virtue of his relation to the Department he may require the reports to be made to the Attorney General, who, by the direction of the President, may be intrusted with the duty of securing the information and recommendations which the President should have in order properly to pass upon applications for clemency; and for these purposes the Department could require \n\n[233 U.S. 223, 235]\n\u00a0\n the necessary reports from those engaged in its service.\n Further, there can be no question that the authority of the Department in its undertaking to suppress the forbidden traffic extended to every matter in which its aid was appropriate. That was the clear import of the legislation broadly defining its powers and of the action of Congress in supporting its work. Whenever it could afford assistance in the course of proceedings to secure the punishment of offenders it was fully empowered to give it. If a judge in fixing the sentence to be imposed upon those found guilty, or in determining whether the sentence as imposed should be suspended or reduced, desired to be advised of the recommendation of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in view of his knowledge of the conditions attending the enforcement of the law, the Commissioner was not lacking in authority to comply with the request. It is not enough to say that there is no mandatory requirement imposing the obligation to give the recommendation. In executing the powers of the Indian Office there is necessarily a wide range for administrative discretion, and in determining the scope of official action regard must be had to the authority conferred; and this, as we have seen, embraces every action which may properly constitute an aid in the enforcement of the law.\n The Commissioner was entitled to give his recommendations to the judge or to the United States attorney upon request, and he had complete power under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior to establish rules and usages in the Department by which he could secure correct information and uncorrupted advice from every one of his subordinates. None of these officers could properly say that in reporting with respect to the effect of leniency in particular cases he was acting outside the sphere of official conduct, and the giving and acceptance of bribes to influence their reports and recommendations \n\n[233 U.S. 223, 236]\n\u00a0\n was within the statutes under which these indictments were laid.\n The judgment of the District Court in each case is reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These regulations are as follows:\n'574. Having therefore the power to break up to a great extent this demoralizing traffic' (the liquor traffic), 'agents are expected to use the utmost vigilance in enforcing the penalties of the law against all persons who engage in it with the Indians under their charge, whether this is done on or off the reservation.\n\n'575. When persons are detected in a violation of the law their cases should be placed in the hands of the district attorney for the district wherein the crime was committed, in order that they may be promptly arrested, tried, and punished; and agents will cooperate with that officer in his efforts to convict the guilty parties, furnishing him with the requisite evidence and all the facts that they may be able to obtain for the purpose indicated. Indians are competent witnesses in these cases.\n\n'576. It is also the duty of agents to strictly carry out the provisions of  2140 and 2141 of the Revised Statutes of the United States respecting the searching for concealed liquors within their agencies, and respecting the destruction of distilleries set up or continued in Indian country.'

In 1906 criminal dockets in Indian territory became so crowded and the possibility of early trial so remote that disregard of the statutes forbidding introduction of intoxicants assumed large importance. To meet the emergency, Congress, in the act of June 21, 1906, appropriated $25,000 to be used to suppress the traffic in intoxicating liquors among Indians, and in August, 1906, a special officer was commissioned and sent to Oklahoma that he and his subordinates might, through detective operations, supplement the efforts of superintendents in charge of reservations. In the fiscal year 1909, when the appropriation had grown to $40,000, this service began to operate throughout all states where Indians needed protection. In 1911 the service had grown until it had an appropriation of $70,000 and an organization including 1 chief special officer, 1 assistant chief, 2 constables, 12 special officers, and 143 local deputies stationed in 21 states. The increasing success of the service appears in the fact that in 1909, 561 cases which the service secured came to issue in court, resulting in 548 convictions, whereas in 1911, 1,202 cases came to issue, 1,168 defendants were convicted, and but 34 defendants were acquitted by juries. In 1911 fines imposed amounted to $ 80,463, or more than the appropriation for the service.' H. Doc. No. 933, 62d Cong. 3d Sess. pp. 11, 12. \n\n\n\n\n","241":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Beck for appellee.\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 29, 31]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The appellee, the Butler County Railroad Company, filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission its petition asking for the re- establishment of through routes and joint rates with certain trunk lines, which was consolidated with and decided upon the same record as the complaints before the Commission in the Tap Line Case involved in \n\n[234 U.S. 29, 32]\n\u00a0\n the previous cases Nos. 829 to 836, just decided, \n233 U.S. 1\n, 58 L. ed . --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 741. The general statement of the Commission in its report and supplemental report, filed April 23 and May 14, 1912 (23 Inters. Com. Rep. 277, 549), referred to in those cases, preceded the following findings of fact:\n The Butler County Railroad Company, the Brooklyn Cooperage Company, which owns the railroad company, and the Great Western Land Company, owning most of the timber reached by the railroad, are all subsidiaries of the American Sugar Refining Company.\n The tap line, which was acquired from the cooperage company, consists of a section of track at Linstead, near Poplar Bluff, Missouri, extending into the plant of the cooperage company, and connecting it with the St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Railway and the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad, which are within three-quarters of a mile of the plant, and the principal track extending about 7 miles from Lowell Junction, a station on the Iron Mountain, 7 1\/2 miles from Poplar Bluff, to Baileys, with a branch about 3 miles from Rossville, an intermediate point, and with trackage rights over unincorporated spurs from Baileys belonging to the cooperage company, and over the Iron Mountain from Lowell Junction to Poplar Bluff, paying for the latter 65c. a train mile for 25 cars. It has 2 locomotives, 2 passenger coaches, 3 cabooses, and about 100 freight and log cars.\n The tap line hauls the logs, all of which are hardwood, from a connection with the unincorporated track to Lowell Junction, then over the Iron Mountain to Linstead, and thence to the mill over its own track, where they are unloaded by the cooperage company. The regular manufacturing rate under the Missouri distance tariff is charged the cooperage company by the tap line, 1 to 1 1\/2 c. per 100 pounds, approximately $4 per car. The loaded cars are switched to the Frisco or Iron Mountain, less than 1 \n\n[234 U.S. 29, 33]\n\u00a0\n mile, and the appellee receives from them an allowance of from 2 to 5c. per 100 pounds. The rates from tap line points, including the mill at Linstead, are in all cases 2c. higher than the rates of the trunk lines from Poplar Bluff, excepting to New Orleans and New York, to which points most of the shipments of the cooperage company go, and to which Poplar Bluff rates apply.\n 184,688 tons of forest products and 2,475 tons of other freight were hauled during the year ending June 30, 1910; of the first amount 107,527 tons being furnished by the controlling interests, 77,161 tons by outsiders, but all the timber coming from the lands of the Great Western Land Company, and of the miscellaneous freight, 1,195 tons of inbound machinery and coal being for the proprietary companies. Passenger revenues were $4,104.22. Three mixed trains in each direction are operated daily between Linstead and Melville, a point beyond Baileys on the unincorporated track, two being used principally for passenger service.\n The Great Western Land Company furnishes timber to several independent industries on the tracks of the tap line near Linstead, the tap line switching their product to the trunk lines. Their factory sites are leased from the cooperage company, the purpose of making such leases being to secure traffic upon which the tap line might obtain divisions. A few independent producers on the main track of the tap line team their supplies and ship their products over the tap line. They pay the local rate of the tap line and the trunk line rate, or a through rate that is 2 cents higher than the Poplar Bluff rate.\n The Commission found that the sugar company, having refineries at New Orleans and New York, so adjusted the rates to such places as to induce movements to them and restrict movements to other points, and limited the amount the tap line might receive on proprietary traffic \n\n[234 U.S. 29, 34]\n\u00a0\n moved from the mill to the Iron Mountain and Frisco to a switching charge fixed at $1.50 per car.\n The order of the Commission, so far as it related to the appellee, required the trunk lines named to re-establish and maintain with it the through interstate routes and joint rates in effect, in accordance with their respective tariffs filed with the Commission on April 30, 1912; provided that the rates on yellow-pine lumber and articles taking the same rates from points on the line of the appellee should not exceed the current rates in effect from the junction points, and\n'Provided further, that the allowances or divisions out of such joint rates to be paid by said principal defendants [the trunk lines], respectively, to the said last-named parties to the record [the appellee and others] on the products of the mills of the said respective proprietary companies named in said report, shall not exceed the divisions or allowances specified in the aforesaid supplemental report of the Commission [in this instance the switching charge of $1.50 per car] which are hereby fixed as maximum divisions or allowances thereon, until further order, the Commission finding upon the record that any allowances or divisions in excess thereof result in undue preferences and unjust discriminations and are unlawful.'\n\n The appellee then brought suit in the United States commerce court, seeking to enjoin and annul the order of the Commission in so far as it forbade a division out of the joint rates of more than $1.50 per car. The commerce court held, after stating that the Commission had found this road to be a common carrier both of logs and of lumber, and not a plant facility, but had denied it the right to receive either a division or allowance for the log traffic, and only an allowance for the lumber traffic of the proprietary mill, while permitting it to receive a division out of the joint rate for both log and lumber traffic of nonproprietary companies, that the reasons stated in the other \n\n[234 U.S. 29, 35]\n\u00a0\n opinion applied here, and that the distinctions made were arbitrary, and the order beyond the power of the Commission, and the commerce court decreed that that part of the order of the commerce court above quoted, with reference to the divisions and allowances to be made out of the joint rates, be vacated and set aside as to the appellee. 209 Fed. 260.\n The United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission, the latter having intervened in the proceeding in the commerce court, prosecuted this appeal.\n This case was argued on the same day with the other tap line cases, and much that is said in those cases is applicable here. The Commission ordered the restoration of the schedule of tariffs of April 30, 1912, thus recognizing the right of this road to participate in joint tariffs with other common carriers and to receive a division out of the joint rates. But the Commission excepted from this right traffic offered to the appellee by its proprietary company, evidently upon the theory enforced in the other cases before the Commission that, as to such traffic, the railroad company had not the rights of a common carrier, and as to such traffic limited the compensation of the railroad company to a switching charge of $1.50 per car.\n We think the commerce court correctly held the fact that the same ownership controlled the freight offered and the railroad company would not justify the different rate imposed upon the same kind of traffic. Under the commodities clause of the act to regulate commerce, as amended ( 34 Stat. at L.) 584, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1288), the right of a carrier, as we have said in the former opinion in these cases, to carry this class of freight, although owned by it, is recognized as lawful. This being so, such carrier, until the law otherwise provides, has the right to treat such freight in the same manner as it does like freight independently owned. Of course, if the division of the rates \n\n[234 U.S. 29, 36]\n\u00a0\n is a mere cover for rebates or discriminations, such practices may be controlled by the Commission under the authority given to it in the act to regulate commerce.\n We find no error in the disposition the Commerce Court made of this case, and its judgment is therefore affirmed. \n\n\n\n","242":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Kirchwey for the United States.\n Mr. William D. Guthrie for Harriet Goelet.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The questions asked in both of these cases relate to  37 of the tariff act of 1909 [36 Stat. at L. 112, chap. 6, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1197], which we have construed in several opinions just announced. They both concern the sum of excise duties levied on the foreign-built yacht Nahma, the one assessed for the year ending on the 1st of September, 1909, and the other on the 1st of September, 1910. The cases were decided by the trial court at the same time with other cases for a like period, the case relating to the tax for 1909 having been submitted on bill and answer as a result of the overruling a demurrer filed by the government to the answer of the defendant and the election to plead no further, and the case involving the levy for 1910 having been decided by the court along with other cases wthout the intervention of a jury, as the result of a stipulation between the parties. The certificate fully states the situation as to both periods of taxation, conforming to the conditions of fact which we have recapitulated in the opinions in the two Billings Cases [ \n232 U.S. 421\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 421], \n\n[232 U.S. 293, 295]\n\u00a0\n AND THE QUESTIONS ASKED CONCERNING THE COnstruction of the statute, its operation and its constitutionality, involve all the subject-matters which we have disposed of in the previous opinions. In both of these cases, however, differing from those which we have previously decided, in the pleadings concerning the 1909 tax it was expressly averred, and by the demurrer conceded, that the owner of the yacht, at least for a year prior to the levy of the tax, was domiciled in a foreign country, and that the yacht whose use was taxed had a permanent situs in such country, and, so far as the levy for 1910 is concerned, that state of things, as shown by the certificate, was expressly covered by the findings of fact; and if the opinion of the trial court be considered, it will appear that it was one of these peculiarities of fact, that is, the permanent domicil abroad, which led that court, instead of deciding in favor of the tax, to hold that as to both periods it was unauthorized by the statute. To make the situation perfectly clear we quote from the certificate in the case concerning the 1909 tax (No. 631) the exact language of the answer on the subjects just stated, the equivalent of which is embraced in the case involving the 1910 tax (No. 632), as follows:\n'That the defendant was, on September 1, 1909, and for several years prior thereto had been, permanently a resident of and domiciled at Paris, in the Republic of France; and that since 1901 her said yacht had not been within the jurisdiction of the United States, but had had a permanent situs within the jurisdiction of Great Britain.'\n\n For the purpose of enabling it to determine the influence of the facts thus stated upon the decision of these two cases, the court, in its certificate, in addition to many questions involving the issues of construction and constitutionality which we have disposed of in the other cases, asks two questions whose order of statement we rearrange as follows: \n\n[232 U.S. 293, 296]\n\u00a0\n 'II. Does the tax purporting to be imposed by said act of Congress apply to the use of a foreign-built yacht owned by a citizen of the United States who was permanently resident and domiciled in a foreign country for more than one year prior to September 1, 1909, and to the levy of such tax?\n'I. Does the tax purporting to be imposed by  37 of the act of Congress, approved August 5, 1909, apply to the use of a foreign-built yacht owned by a citizen of the United States, when such yacht, for a period of more than one year prior to September 1, 1909, and to the levy of such tax, was used wholly outside of the limits and territorial jurisdiction of the United States?'\n\n It is manifest from what we have said that the response to these two questions will be substantially determinative of all the questions which the certificate propounds, since if we answer either of them in the negative, the case will be disposed of and there will be no occasion to reply to the others; and if, on the contrary, we answer both of them in the affirmative, there will be no need to do anything but state our reply to the other questions, since the reasons for such reply will be controlled by the opinions which we have previously announced. We come then to consider the questions in the order stated.\n Not in the slightest degree questioning that there was power to impose the excise duty on the citizen owning a foreign-built yacht wholly irrespective of the fact that he was permanently domiciled in a foreign country, and putting out of view all questions concerning the nonapplication of the statute to the case in hand purely because of the situs of the yacht itself, the single matter for decision 15, Do the terms of the statute provide for the payment by a citizen of the United States who has a permanent residence and domicil abroad of an excise duty because of the use by him as owner or charterer under the terms of the statute of a foreign-built yacht? It may not \n\n[232 U.S. 293, 297]\n\u00a0\n be doubted, as observed by the trial court in these cases (omitting the consideration of taxes imposed on property having a situs within the jurisdiction of the taxing authority), speaking in a general sense, that the taxing power, when exerted, is not usually applied to those even albeit they are citizens, who have a permanent domicil or residence outside of the country levying the tax. Indeed, we think it must be conceded that the levy of such a tax is so beyond the normal and usual exercise of the taxing power as to cause it to be, when exerted, of rare occurrence and in the fullest sense exceptional. This being true, we must approach the statute for the purpose of ascertaining whether its provisions sanction such rare and exceptional taxation. Considering the text, we search in vain for the express declaration of such authority. True, it is argued by the United States, that as the tax is levied on any citizen using a foreign-built yacht, and as any includes all, therefore the statute expressly embraces a citizen permanently domiciled and residing abroad. But this argument in effect begs the question for decision, which is whether the use of the general words 'any citizen,' without more, should be considered as expressing more than the general rule of taxation; or, in other words, can be treated without the expression of more as embracing the exceptional exertion of the power to tax one permanently lesiding abroad. As illustrative and throwing light on the real question for decision, action taken by Congress in exerting its taxing power is at least worthy of note. For instance the provisions of the income tax law of June 30th, 1864 (13 Stat. at. L. 281, chap. 173), expressly extended that tax to those domiciled abroad, and a like purpose is beyond doubt expressed in the income tax of 1913 (subdivision 1 of the tariff act of October 3, 1913). But without resting this case upon the implication against the conferring of the authority here claimed from the mere want of express statement in the statute of the giving of such exceptional \n\n[232 U.S. 293, 298]\n\u00a0\n power, and treating such implication as not, in and of itself, absolutely conclusive, we think when to the force of such inference, even though it be limited, there is added the weight arising from that which is expressly stated in the statute, the conclusion against want of power conferred to levy the tax here asserted is established. This arises from the command of the statute that the tax shall be levied 'by the collector of customs of the district nearest the residence of the managing owner,' etc., since the consequence of such command is to associate residence with citizenship, and establishes such a relationship between them as to bring about the result which we have just stated. Nor do we think there is anything as suggested by the argument of the United States in the case of Eidman v. Martinez, \n184 U.S. 591\n, 46 L. ed. 704, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 515, which militates against the views just stated; and this also is true of the suggestion made in argument concerning the circulation by those interested in the enactment of the provision of a list of yachts which would become subject to the tax if the provision was enacted, which list included the yacht taxed in this case. The expectations of those who sought the enactment of legislation may not be used for the purpose of affixing to legislation when enacted a meaning which it does not express.\n For the reasons just stated we conclude to answer the second question in the negative, and not to reply to the others, as it becomes unnecessary to do so.\n And it will be so certified. \n\n\n\n","243":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. LOUISIANA & P R CO(1914)\nNo. 829\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1914\n\n\n\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n\n\n[234 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n These are all appeals from decrees of the United States commerce court (209 Fed. 244), annulling orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, refusing in whole or in part to compel certain common carriers which had filed schedules canceling former schedules covering through routes and joint rates with the Louisiana & Pacific Railway Company, the Woodworth & Louisiana Central Railway Company, the Mansfield Railway & Transportation Company, and the Victoria, Fisher, & Western Railroad Company, appellees, hereinafter referred to as the tap lines, to establish or re-establish through routes and joint rates and to grant allowances and divisions to the tap lines.\n The Commission, after an extensive investigation of the tap lines in the lumber regions, particularly in the states of Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana, and Texas, on April 23 and May 14, 1912, filed its report and supplementary report (23 Inters. Com. Rep. 277, 549). The report deals at some length with the manner in which logs and lumber are moved in that territory, and the practices attending such traffic. The Commission found the identification of the road with the industry, the necessity of incorporation to secure divisions and allowances, the great amount in the aggregate paid by the trunk lines to the tap lines, and the resulting discrimination, the fact that allowances were dependent upon the bargain the tap lines might exact from the trunk lines for a proportion of their traffic, and not upon the amount of service rendered, and the fact that most of the lumber mills were near public carriers, and that the tap lines would not be kept in operation if the mills were removed. General principles for determining the character \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n of carriers were set forth, and the conclusion stated that the real relation of a tap line was a question to be decided upon the facts in each case.\n The Commission entered upon a particular examination of the various lines under investigation, among others, the appellees in these appeals. It found:\n The Louisiana & Pacific Railway Company, controlled by the R. A. Long interests, owning a controlling interest in the Hudson River Lumber Company, the King-Ryder Lumber Company, Longville Lumber Company, and the Calcasieu Long Leaf Lumber Company, consists of the following tracks, all of which were originally constructed as private logging roads: (1) A track from De Ridder Junction, Louisiana (all of the lines involved in these cases are within that state), to Bundicks, a distance of 8 miles. The mill of the Hudson River Lumber Company, in whose interest this track is operated, is located at De Ridder, within a few hundred feet of the trunk lines; Bundicks is apparently a logging camp with a company store. (2) A track from Lilly Junction to Walla, about 7 1\/2 miles, the latter being a point in the woods where the King-Ryder Lumber Company has a commissary, and where is located a small independent yellow-pine mill, owned by the Bundick Creek Lumber Company. The mill of the King-Ryder Company is at Bon Ami, a town of 2,000, located on the Lake Charles & Northern Railroad Company, a short distance from and connected by it with Lilly Junction. (3) A track of 2 miles at Longville, a town of 2,000 people, where the Longville Lumber Company has its mill and a store, and where also are several independent stores. (4) A track of 9 miles from Fayette to Camp Curtis, a place of 200 population, where the Calcasieu Long Leaf Lumber Company has a store, its mill being at Lake Charles. (5) A track of 1 mile from Bridge Junction to Lake Charles station. The towns De Ridder, Bon Ami, Lilly Junction, Longville, Fayette, and \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n Lake Charles are connected by the Lake Charles & Northern Railroad, a Southern Pacific Railway Company line, originally built by the Long interests as a part of the Louisiana & Pacific, and sold to the Lake Charles & Northern with the reservation of trackage rights advantageous to the Louisiana & Pacific, By means of this arrangement the Louisiana & Pacific connects with the Kansas City Southern and the Sante Fe at De Ridder, with the Frisco at Fulton (a station south of Fayette), and with the Southern Pacific, Iron Mountain, & Kansas City Southern at Lake Charles. Its equipment consists of 22 locomotives, 6 cabooses, 41 freight cars, and 270 logging cars, and a private car used by its officers, who are connected with the lumber companies, in traveling around the country. The lumber companies have many miles of unincorporated logging tracks connecting with the Louisiana & Pacific at various points. There are a number of other stations on the line, among them Bannister, where the Brown Lumber Company owns a small, independent mill.\n The operation is this: The lumber companies load the logs and switch them over the logging spurs to connection with the tap line which hauls them to the mill, an average distance of 30 miles, for which no charge is made. The tap line switches the carloads of lumber from the mill at Lake Charles, a distance of three quarters of a mile, to the Southern Pacific; at De Ridder, only a few hundred feet to the trunk lines; from the Lake Charles mill to the Frisco, a distance of 18 miles; from the Bon Ami mill to the Southern Pacific at Lake Charles, a distance of 40 miles; and from the Longville mill to the Southern Pacific at Lake Charles, a distance of 24 miles,-the average haul for the controlling companies being nearly 20 miles. By written agreement 50 per cent of the lumber must be routed over the Frisco and 40 per cent over the Southern Pacific, but this is not always done. 243,122 tons of lumber, as against 8,819 tons of merchandise, were shipped in 1910, 98 per cent of the whole ton- \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n nage being supplied by the controlling interests. The passenger receipts for 1910 were $473.77. A logging train runs daily on each branch, and there is one 'mixed' train, loaded chiefly with logs and lumber, between Lake Charles and De Ridder. The allowances paid by the trunk lines range from 1 1\/2 to 5 1\/2c. per 100 pounds out of their earnings under the group- lumber rate. The operating revenue for the year ending June 30, 1910, was $ 220,985.94, with operating expenses of $145,433.69, and there was an accumulated surplus of $73,581.07 on that date.\n The Commission found that no charge was made for hauling the logs to the mills by the tap line, and that for the short switching service allowances were made as above stated, and concluded that it regarded the whole arrangement as indefensible and unlawful, and saw no ground upon which any allowance might lawfully be made.\n The Woodworth & Louisiana Central Railway Company and the Rapides Lumber Company, situated at Woodworth, are identical in interest. The mill is near the Iron Mountain, which has a spur track to the mill, and the tap line has a standard gauge track from the mill to La Moria, about 6 miles, where it connects with the Southern Pacific Railway, texas & Pacific Railway, and Chicago, Rock Island, & Pacific Railway, and a narrow-gauge track in the other direction for 18 miles, whence spur tracks go into the timber. The equipment consists of 1 standard-gauge locomotive, 5 narrow- gauge locomotives, and 2 standard and 9 narrow-gauge cars. The steel in the logging spurs and 4 of the narrow-gauge locomotives used by the lumber company on the spurs are owned by the tap line and leased to the lumber company; while the right of way for the narrow-gauge track is leased from the lumber company.\n The tap line hauls the logs from its terminus to the mill without charge, where they are dumped by the trainmen into the mill pond. The carloads of lumber are switched \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n by the tap line from the planing mill to the place where they are taken by the Iron Mountain, about 25 feet. About 95 per cent of the lumber goes through La Moria, being switched there by the tap line; the allowances from the Iron Mountain out of through rates being from 1 1\/2 to 5 1\/2c. per 100 pounds, while from the trunk lines at La Moria from 2 to 5 1\/2c. There are no joint rates except on lumber. For the year ending June 30, 1910, there were 40,707 tons of freight handled for the lumber company and 2,100 tons of outside traffic. It has no passenger business. Its operations for that year showed a deficit, but there was a surplus from previous years of nearly $10,000. It files annual reports with the Commission.\n The Mansfield Railway & Transportation Company and the Frost-Johnson Lumber Company are identical in interest. The tap line extends from Mansfield to a logging camp in the woods, known as Hunter, a distance of about 16 miles, and the line which was originally incorporated by the citizens of Mansfield in 1881, consisting of 2 miles of track from the town to a connection with the Texas & Pacific at Mansfield Junction. Later the Mansfield Company acquired the 2 mile track and equipment, and the interests controlling it purchased a large amount of timber lands near Mansfield at a point called Oak Hill, where a mill was built, and spur tracks were laid into the timber, which were later turned over to the Mansfield Company, with the free privilege reserved to the lumber company to operate logging trains between the timber and the mill, which operation is performed by a subsidiary company. The purchase price did not reflect the value of the reservation. There are about 25 miles of unincorporated logging tracks. The tap line also has a connection with the Kansas City Southern. It owns a locomotive, a passenger coach, and a box car.\n The service performed by the tap line is switching cars between the mill and the Kansas City Southern, about \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n 3\/4 of a mile, although the mill is within 300 feet of the Kansas City Southern, and was formerly connected by a spur track which was abandoned and taken up, and to the Texas & Pacific, a distance of 2 1\/2 miles. The tap line bears the expense of maintaining its tracks extending into the woods.\n No other yellow-pine mills are served by the tap line, but there is a hardwood mill adjacent to the Frost-Johnson mill, obtaining a substantial portion of its logs from the latter company or subsidiaries, the price including delivery at the hardwood mill, the logs being hauled by the logging company under its trackage right. Some logs are also obtained from the Texas & Pacific, for the switching of which the hardwood mill pays the tap line $2.50 a car or less. The tap line maintains joint rates on hardwood as well as yellow pine.\n Practically no traffic other than that in which the lumber company is interested moves over the track from Mansfield to Hunter, but a good deal of outside traffic moves over the original 2 miles from Mansfield to Mansfield Junction. 16,539 tons of miscellaneous freight were handled during the year ending June 30, 1910, most of which passed over the Mansfield Junction branch, and much of which was for the controlling interests or their employees; while during the same time 28,596 tons, of lumber were handled, 91.4 per cent of which was supplied by the lumber company. A daily train is operated by the tap line in each direction on regular schedule, handling passengers, mail, and express; but in 1910 the passenger revenues were only $1,209.76, while its freight revenues were $ 25,617.19.\n The Commission noticed the abandonment of the 300-foot spur track, and then the payment of an allowance of 1 to 4c. per 100 pounds, and held that it was a mere manipulation of the situation in order to establish an unlawful relation; and also held that since the tap line crosses the \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n right of way of the Texas & Pacific within a short distance, the allowance of a like amount by the Texas & Pacific for switching from the mill to Mansfield and down to the junction was unlawful.\n The Victoria, Fisher, & Western Railroad Company and the Louisiana Long Leaf Lumber Company have the same stockholders and officers. The tap line extends from Victoria, where it connects with the Texas & Pacific, to Fisher, where it crosses the Kansas City Southern Railway, and then extends to Cain, in all about 31 miles. A part of the track was built some time ago, and was acquired by the lumber company in 1900. In 1902 the railroad company was incorporated and its stock exchanged as a stock dividend for the line. There are about 25 miles of logging spurs and side tracks. The equipment consists of 5 locomotives, 4 cabooses, 3 box cars, 1 flat car, and 105 logging cars. It does not operate any trains on regular schedule. There are two mills owned by the Lumber Company, one about a mile from the junction with the Texas & Pacific, and the other about half a mile from the tracks of the Kansas City Southern.\n The tap line hauls the logs from the forest to the mill, charging $1. 50 per 1,000 feet, which is supposed to cover only the service performed on the logging spurs, and not the haul over the main track. The greater part of the lumber from Fisher is turned over to the Kansas City Southern, involving a one-half mile switch by the tap line, and from Victoria is moved by the tap line 1 mile to the Texas & Pacific; a small amount of the lumber from each mill is taken by the tap line to the more distant trunk line, but the same divisions are paid. The allowances range from 3\/4 to 4c. per 100 pounds, and the joint rates are the same as the rates published from adjacent mills on the trunk lines, except traffic moving to Texas, for which 1 1\/4c. per 100 pounds is added to the junction-point rate. No passengers are carried, and of 316,676 tons \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n of freight for the year 1910, over 99 per cent was furnished by the proprietary company. And the accumulated surplus at the end of June, 1910, was $13,509.17.\n The Commission held that the tap line could not participate as a common carrier in joint rates on the products of the proprietary company, but said that the lumber rate of the trunk lines applied from the adjacent mills, and that they might make a reasonable allowance for switching.\n The Commission made an order in such matter on May 14, 1912, which it amended on October 30, 1912. The amended order, so far as these appeals are concerned, provided:\n'The Commission upon the record finds in the case of the . . . Woodworth & Louisiana Central Railway Company; Mansfield Railway & Transportation Company; Louisiana & Pacific Railway Company; Victoria, Fisher, & Western Railroad Company,-that the tracks and equipment, with respect to the industry of the several proprietary companies, are plant facilities, and that the service performed therewith for the respective proprietary lumber companies in moving logs to their respective mills, and performed therewith in moving the products of the mills to the trunk lines, is not a service of transportation by a common carrier railroad, but is a plant service by a plant facility; and that any allowances or divisions out of the rate on account thereof are unlawful and result in undue and unreasonable preferences and unjust discriminations, as found in the said reports;' and it ordered that the trunk lines should cease and desist and abstain from making any such allowances to the tap lines named.\n\n The commission further ordered that if the trunk lines failed by a time stated, to re-establish the through routes and joint rates in effect on April 30, 1912, on traffic other than the products of the mills of certain proprietary com- \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n panies, among others, the appellees herein, it would, upon proper petition, enter an order requiring the establishment of such routes and rates, or enter upon an inquiry with respect thereto, and further provided that all divisions of joint rates should be submitted to the Commission for approval.\n The appellees thereupon, by their several petitions filed in the United States commerce court, sought to have the order of the Commission, so far as applicable to them, enjoined and annulled. The Interstate Commerce Commission, the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railway Company, the Gulf, Colorado, & Santa Fe Railway Company, and the Railroad Commission of Louisiana, intervened. The commerce court said that the question was whether the Commission had acted arbitrarily and on improper considerations in determining under what circumstances a common carrier tap line would be deemed to be performing a mere plant service for a proprietary company, and held that as the service rendered to the proprietary and nonproprietary mills by the tap lines was the same, and as it was held to be a transportation service by an interstate common carrier as to the nonproprietary mills, it must be held to be a similar service as to the proprietary mills, and concluded that the Commission was without power to prohibit the making of joint rates by the trunk lines and the tap lines, and the payment of some division of such rates to the tap lines for their services in hauling logs to and lumber from the proprietary mills, and annulled the order of the Commission in this respect and so far as it applied to the appellees.\n The United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Fe Railway Company, and the Gulf, Colorado, & Santa Fe Railway Company, entered separate appeals from the decrees of the commerce court in the four cases instituted by the appellees. \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, Solicitor General Davis, and Mr. Karl W. Kirchwey for the United States.\n Messrs. Charles W. Needham and Joseph W. Folk for the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert Dunlap. James L. Coleman, T. J. Norton, and Gardiner Lathrop for the Atchison, Topeka, & Santa Re Railway Company.\n\n\n[234 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. M. Garwood, Luther M. Walter, and W. R. Thurmond for appellees.\n\n\n[234 U.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wylie M. Barrow and Mr. Ruffin G. Pleasant, Attorney General of Louisiana, for the Railroad Commission of Louisiana. \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n A preliminary objection is made to the jurisdiction of the commerce court in that the order of the Commission is not reviewable because merely of a negative character. The commerce court examined this question, and in view of the amended order of October 30, 1912, reached the conclusion that the order was affirmative in its nature, and of a character permitting of review by proper proceedings in that court under the act giving it jurisdiction in such cases. We find no reason to differ with this conclusion, and are of opinion that the commerce court had jurisdiction in the case.\n It is further insisted upon the authority of Proctor & G. Co. v. United States, \n225 U.S. 282\n, 56 L. ed. 1091, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 761, and other cases in this court which have followed that decision, that in the present cases the decision rests upon conclusions of the Commission as to matters of fact only, which are within the sole jurisdiction of that body, and not reviewable in the courts. But we shall consider the case upon the findings of fact preceding this opinion, which are identical with those made by the Commission, and test the conclusions reached as matters of law, giving proper consideration to matters of fact which are not in dispute.\n The final decree of the commerce court vacated and set aside the portion of the Commission's order reading as follows:\n'That the tracks and equipment with respect to the industry of the several proprietary companies are plant facilities, and that the service performed therewith for the \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n respective proprietary lumber companies in moving logs to their respective mills, and performed therewith in moving the products of the mills to the trunk lines, is not a service of transportation by a common carrier railroad, but is a plant service by a plant facility; and that any allowances or divisions out of the rate on account thereof are unlawful and result in undue and unreasonable preferences and unjust discriminations, as found in the said reports.\n\n'3. It is ordered, that the principal defendants [trunk lines, naming them], be, and they are hereby, notified and required to cease and desist, and for a period of two years hereafter, or until otherwise ordered, to abstain from making any such allowances to any of the above-named parties to the record in respect of any such above-described service.'\n\n The question now before this court is the correctness of this decree.\n A perusal of the findings and orders of the Commission make it apparent that the grounds of decision upon which it proceeded were two: first, that these roads were mere plant facilities; second, that they were not common carriers as to proprietary traffic. The Commission held that before incorporation they were plant facilities, and that after incorporation they remained such. What the Commission means by plant facilities may be gathered from a consideration of some of its decisions. In General Electric Co. v. New York C. & H. R. R. Co. 14 Inters. Com. Rep. 237, a network of interior switching tracks, constructed to meet the necessities of the business, were held to be mere plant facilities. The same principle was applied to the internal trackage of large industrial plants in Solvay Process Co. v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. 14 Inters. Com. Rep. 246. These systems of internal trackage were not common carriers, and, however extensive, were intended to and did furnish service for the plants which owned and \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n operated them. But a common carrier performing service as such, regulated and operated under competent authority, as observed by Commissioner Prouty in Kaul Lumber Co. v. Central of Georgia R. Co. 20 Inters. Com. Rep. 450, 456, is no longer a mere appendage of a mill, 'but a public institution.' It thus becomes apparent that the real question in these cases is the true character of the roads here involved. Are they plant facilities merely, or common carriers with rights and obligations as such?\n It is insisted that these roads are not carriers because the most of their traffic is in their own logs and lumber, and that only a small part of the traffic carried is the property of others. But this conclusion loses sight of the principle that the extent to which a railroad is in fact used does not determine the fact whether it is or is not a common carrier. It is the right of the public to use the road's facilities and to demand service of it, rather than the extent of its business, which is the real criterion determinative of its character. This principle has been frequently recognized in the decision of the courts. We need not cite the many state cases in which it has been so held, in view of the fact that the same principle was laid down in the late case of Union Lime Co. v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co. \n233 U.S. 211\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 522. In that case the supreme court of Wisconsin sustained the extension of a spur track to reach the quarries and lime kilns of a single company as a public use authorizing the exercise of the right of emiment domain, and this court affirmed the judgment. Dealing with the contention that the Wisconsin statute was invalid because it authorized action appropriating property upon the exigency of a private business, this court said (p. 221):\n'A spur may, at the outset, lead only to a single industry or establishment; it may be constructed to furnish an outlet for the products of a particular plant; its cost may be defrayed by those in special need of its service at the \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n time. But none the less, by virtue of the conditions under which it is provided, the spur may constitute at all times a part of the transportation facilities of the carrier which are operated under the obligations of public service and are subject to the regulation of public authority. As was said by this court in Hairston v. Danville & W. R. Co. \n208 U.S. 608\n, 52 L. ed. 641, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 331, 13 Ann. Cas. 1008: 'The uses for which the track was desired are not the less public because the motive which dictated its location over this particular land was to reach a private industry, or because the proprietors of that industry contributed in any way to the cost.' There is a clear distinction between spurs which are owned and operated by a common carrier as a part of its system and under its public obligation, and merely private sidings. See State, De Camp, Prosecutor, v. Hibernia Underground R. Co. 47 N. J. L. 43; Chicago, B. & N. R. Co. v. Porter, 43 Minn. 527, 46 N. W. 75; Ulmer v. Lime Rock R. Co. 98 Me. 579, 66 L.R.A. 387, 57 Atl. 101; St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Petty, 57 Ark. 359, 20 L.R.A. 434, 21 S. W. 884; Dietrich v. Murdock, 42 Mo. 279; Bedford Quarries Co. v. Chicago, I. & L. R. Co. 175 Ind. 303, 35 L.R.A.(N.S.) 641, 94 N. E. 326.'\n\n The Commission has recognized this principle as applicable to tap lines, for in Central Yellow Pine Asso. v. Vicksburg, S. & P. R. Co. 10 Inters. Com. Rep. 193, 199, it said:\n'While these logging roads are almost or quite without exception mill propositions at the outset, built exclusively for the purpose of transporting logs to the mill, they soon reach a point where they engage in other business to a greater or less extent. As the length of the road increases, as the lumber is taken off and other operations obtain a foothold along the line, various commodities besides lumber are transported, and this business gradually develops until in several cases what was at first a logging road pure and simple has become a common carrier of miscellaneous freight and passengers. Almost all these lines, even where they are run as private enterprises, \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n do more or less outside transportation, and it would be difficult to draw any line of demarcation between the logging road as such and the logging road which has become a general carrier of freight.'\n\n This representation, it is contended by the attorney general of Louisiana, who appears here in behalf of the Louisiana Railroad Commission, intervener, is aptly descriptive of the growth and development of railroads in that state.\n Furthermore, these roads are common carriers when tried by the test of organization for that purpose under competent legislation of the state. They are so treated by the public authorities of the state, who insist in this case that they are such, and submit in oral discussion and printed briefs cogent arguments to justify that conclusion. They are engaged in carrying for hire the goods of those who see fit to employ them. They are authorized to exercise the right of eminent domain by the state of their incorporation. They were treated and dealt with as common carriers by connecting systems of other carriers,-a circumstance to be noticed in determining their true character. United States v. Union Stock Yard & Transit Co. \n226 U.S. 286\n, 57 L. ed. 226, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 83. They are engaged in transportation as that term is defined in the commerce act and described in decisions of this court. Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n, 29 L. ed. 715, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 475; Covington Stock-Yards Co. v. Keith, \n139 U.S. 128\n, 35 L. ed. 73, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 461; Southern P. Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 U.S. 493\n, 55 L. ed. 310, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 279; United States v. Union Stock Yard & Transit Co. supra.\n Applying the principles which we have stated as determinative of the character of these roads, and without repeating the facts concerning them, they would seem to fill all the requirements of common carriers so employed, unless the grounds upon which they were determined not to be such by the Commission are adequate to that end. The Commission itself as to all shippers other than those controlled by the so-called proprietary companies treated \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 27]\n\u00a0\n them as common carriers, for it has ordered the trunk lines to re- establish through routes and joint rates as to such traffic. But, says the government (and it insists that this fact alone might well control the decision), the roads are owned by the persons who also own the timber and mills which they principally serve.\n This fact is not shown to be inconsistent with the laws of the state in which they are organized and operated. On the contrary, the public authorities of that state are here insisting that these companies are common carriers. Congress has not made it illegal for roads thus owned to operate in interstate commerce. While Congress, in enacting the commodities clause amending  1 of the act to regulate commerce (34 Stat. at L. 584, chap. 3591, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1288), sought to divorce transportation from production and manufacture, and to make transportation a business of and by itself, unallied with manufacture and production in which a carrier was itself interested, the debates, which may be resorted to for the purpose of ascertaining the situation which prompted this legislation, show that the situation in some of the states as to the logging industry and transportation was sharply brought to the attention of Congress, and led to the exemption from the commodities clause of timber and the manufactured products thereof, thus indicating the intention to permit railroads to haul such lumber and products although it owned them itself. And that Congress had the constitutional power to enact such exemption was held in United States ex rel. Atty. Gen. v. Delaware & H. Co. \n213 \nU.S. 366, 416\n, 417 S., 53 L. ed. 836, 852, 853, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 527. This declaration of public policy which is now part of the commerce act cannot be ignored in interpreting the power and authority of the Commission under the act. The discussion resulting in the action of Congress shows that railroads built and owned by the same persons who own the timber were regarded as essential to the development of the timber regions in the Southwest, \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 28]\n\u00a0\n AND THE NECESSITY OF SUCH ROADS WAS DWElt upon and set forth with ample illustration by Commissioner Prouty in his concurring opinion in this case.\n As we have said, the Commission by its order herein required the trunk lines to reestablish through routes and joint rates as to property to be transported by others than the proprietary owners over the tap lines. This order would of itself create a discrimination against proprietary owners, for lumber products are carried from this territory upon blanket rates applicable to all within its limits. It follows that independent owners would get this blanket rate for the entire haul of their products while proprietary owners would pay the same rate plus the cost of getting to the trunk line over the tap line. The Commission, by the effect of its order, recognizes that railroads organized and operated as these tap lines are, if owned by others than those who own the timber and mills, would be entitled to be treated as common carriers and to participate in joint rates with other carriers. We think the Commission exceeded its authority when it condemned these roads as a mere attempt to evade the law and to secure rebates and preferences for themselves.\n It is doubtless true, as the Commission amply shows in its full report and supplemental report in these cases, that abuses exist in the conduct and practice of these lines and in their dealings with other carriers, which have resulted in unfair advantages to the owners of some tap lines and in discriminations against the owners of others. Because we reach the conclusion that the tap lines involved in these appeals are common carriers, as well of proprietary as nonproprietary traffic, and as such entitled to participate in joint rates with other common carriers, that the determination falls far short of deciding-indeed, does not at all decide-that the division of such joint rates may be made at the will of the carriers involved and without any power of the Commission to control. That body has the \n\n[234 U.S. 1, 29]\n\u00a0\n authority and it is its duty to reach all unlawful discriminatory practices resulting in favoritism and unfair advantages to particular shippers or carriers. It is not only within its power, but the law makes it the duty, of the Commission to make orders which shall nullify such practices resulting in rebating or preferences, whatever form they take and in whatsoever guise they may appear. If the divisions of joint rates are such as to amount to rebates or discriminations in favor of the owners of the tap lines because of their disproportionate amount in view of the service rendered, it is within the province of the Commission to reduce the amount so that a tap line shall receive just compensation only for what it actually does.\n For the reasons stated, we think the Commerce Court did not err in reaching its conclusion and decision, and its judgment is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","244":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

C. & St. L. charge the full local freight rate from said crossing points to Nashville. These shipments may then be stopped at Nashville for a period not exceeding six months, during which time they may be rebilled or reshipped to destination in southeastern and Carolina territory; and on such reshipments so rebilled the freight charges into and out of Nashville are readjusted so that the total transportation charge on any one shipment from any given Ohio or Mississippi river crossing via Nashville, to any given destination in said territory, shall exactly correspond with the transportation charge legally assessable on that shipment had it been billed and moved through from its point of origin at the said Ohio or Mississippi river crossing points to its final destination without having been stopped in transit at Nashville.' [197 Fed. 59.] \n\n[235 U.S. 314, 319]\n\u00a0\n We adopt the history of the litigation in so far as it relates to the privilege in question contained in the brief on the part of the United States.\n\n'1. In 1908 certain Georgia grain dealers complained to the Interstate Commerce Commission of various traffic practices at Nashville; after taking voluminous proof, the Commission, on June 24, 1909, held the reshipping privilege illegal and ordered it stopped (16 Inters. Com. Rep. 590, 595).\n\n'2. The Commission, on its own motion, postponed the effective date of the order, so that it might institute a country-wide investigation of the practices involved; and on May 3, 1910, the Commission, after a hearing at which about 150 shippers and carriers were represented by counsel, reported that its former order abolishing the reshipping privilege in toto was too strict, and remitted the matter to the carriers and shippers to frame regulations that would prevent any rebating under the privilege (18 Inters. Com. Rep. 280), and, pursuant thereto, new and satisfactory regulations were adopted to safeguard the reshipping privilege (21 Inters. Com. Rep. 183, 188).'\n\n The previous order of June 24, 1909, which had abolished the reshipping privilege at Nashville, was vacated and the Commission thereafter again considered the controversy between the grain dealers of Georgia and the Nashville dealers and carriers.\n'3. . . . On June 9, 1911, the Commission delivered a supplemental report, holding that the action of the carriers in granting the reshipping privilege to Nashville, while refusing it to Atlanta, etc., was an undue and unreasonable preference to Nashville, in violation of  3 of the interstate commerce act. (21 Inters. Com. Rep. 186.) The Commission entered an order in accordance therewith.\n\n'4. The Nashville Board of Trade, the L. & N. R. R. Co., and the N. C . & St. L. R. R. Co. thereupon sued in the commerce court to enjoin the enforcement of the order; the two suits were consolidated.' The record evi- \n\n[235 U.S. 314, 320]\n\u00a0\n dence before the Commission was introduced and some additional testimony was taken.\n\n The commerce court, finding that there was no conflicting or disputed evidence concerning the origin and character of the reshipping privilege, concluded that whether such privilege was an undue preference was not a matter of fact, but a question of law, upon which it was its duty to reach an independent conclusion. The court, therefore, among other considerations, because the privilege was of long standing and was justified by water competition at Nashville, declared it to be not unlawful and not preferential. A peremptory injunction was allowed, restraining the enforcement of the order of the Commission. And the correctness of this action is the question here for decision.\n In view of the doctrine announced in Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois C. R. Co. \n215 U.S. 452\n, 54 L. ed. 280, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 155; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. \n220 U.S. 235\n, 55 L. ed. 448, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 392; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & N. R. Co. \n227 U.S. 88\n, 57 L. ed. 431, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 185, it plainly results that the court below, in substituting its judgment as to the existence of preference for that of the Commission, on the ground that where there was no dispute as to the facts it had a right to do so, obviously exerted an authority not conferred upon it by the statute. It is not disputable that from the beginning the very purpose for which the Commission was created was to bring into existence a body which, from its peculiar character, would be most fitted to primarily decide whether from facts, disputed or undisputed, in a given case, preference or discrimination existed. East Tennessee, v. & G. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n181 U.S. 1\n, 23-29, 45 L. ed. 719, 727-729, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 516. And the amendments by which it came to pass that the findings of the Commission were made not merely prima facie but conclusively correct in case of judicial review, except to the extent pointed out in the Illinois Central and other cases, supra, show the progressive evolution of the legislative purpose and the \n\n[235 U.S. 314, 321]\n\u00a0\n inevitable conflict which exists between giving that purpose effect and upholding the view of the statute taken by the court below. It cannot be otherwise, since if the view of the statute upheld below be sustained, the Commission would become but a mere instrument for the purpose of taking testimony to be submitted to the courts for their ultimate action.\n While these conclusions demonstrate the error in the action of the court below, that result does not authorize us to reverse and give effect to the order of the Commission without going further, since it must be determined whether the action of the Commission was repugnant to the Constitution, in excess of the powers which that body possessed, or, what is equivalent thereto, was wholly unsustained by proof,-questions which the court below failed to pass upon because of the erroneous conception in which it indulged concerning its own powers. But if it were essential for us to consider these questions, we should be confronted with a grave situation arising from the serious doubt which would exist whether it would be possible for us to do so in view of the manner in which the Commission had discharged its functions, and whether that method had not, in and of itself, amounted to a denial of a hearing, and thus resulted in want of due process of law. See Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & N. R. Co. \n227 U.S. 91\n, 57 L. ed. 433, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 185, and the paragraph from the answer of the commission, filed in the court below, which is in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[235 U.S. 314, 322]\n\u00a0\n We pass this subject by, however, because its consideration is not essential to determine whether the Commission was right in prohibiting a continuance of the rebilling privilege, since we are of opinion that even if the allowance of such rebilling privilege when originally made was authorized by the statute, and was therefore not a preference, the right to continue it had been expressly prohibited by statute until, on application made to the Commission, its consent to that end was given. The express or implied statutory recognition of the authority on the part of carriers to primarily determine for themselves the existence of substantially similar circumstances and conditions as a basis of charging a higher rate for a shorter than for a longer distance within the purview of the 4th section of the act to regulate commerce, and the right to make a rate accordingly, to continue in force until, on complaint, it was corrected in the manner pointed out by statute, ceased to exist after the adoption of the amendment to \n\n[235 U.S. 314, 323]\n\u00a0\n  4 [24 Stat. at L. 380, chap. 104] by the act of June 18, 1910, chapter 309, 36 Stat. at L. 547, Comp. Stat. 1913,  8566. This results from the fact that by the amendment in question the original power to determine the existence of the conditions justifying the greater charge for a shorter than was exacted from a longer distance was taken from the carriers and primarily vested in the Interstate Commerce Commission, and for the purpose of making the prohibitions efficacious it was enacted that after a time fixed no existing rate of the character provided for should continue in force unless the application to sanction it had been made and granted. Intermountain Rate Cases (United States v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co.) \n234 U.S. 476\n, 58 L. ed. 1408, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 986. If, then, it be that the rebilling privilege which is here in question, disregarding immaterial considerations of form, and looking at the substance of things, was, when originally established, an exertion of the authority conferred or recognized by the 4th section of the act, as there is no pretense that permission for its continuance had been applied for as required by the amendment, and the statutory period for which it could be lawfully continued without such permission had expired, it follows that its continued operation was manifestly unlawful, and error was committed in permitting its continuance under the shelter of the injunction awarded by the court below. To determine whether the 4th section is applicable requires a very brief consideration of the uncontroverted situation from which the rebilling privilege arose and upon the existence of which it depended. It is undoubted that for many years the Ohio river was a basing point for rates, and traffic moving from the producing regions of the northwest to the consuming regions in the southeast bore rates from Ohio river points to destination, which, because of competition, were lower from Ohio river points to the farther points of consumption than were charged from intermediate (nearer) points between the Ohio river and such points of consumption. This lesser charge for the longer than for the shorter distance as to the traffic in question was \n\n[235 U.S. 314, 324]\n\u00a0\n typically illustrative of the condition contemplated by the 4th section of the act to regulate commerce. As to Nashville, however, this idiosyncracy arose: The carriers from the Ohio river to Nashville, instead of giving the lesser rate for the longer distance from the Ohio river to Nashville than was asked for intermediate points, maintained a local and proportionate rate for grain and other northwestern products from the Ohio river to Nashville, although giving a lower rate for the longer haul from the Ohio river to points in the south or southeast territory beyond Nashville. Upon the basis, however, that there was water competition between the Ohio river and Nashville, if not for other reasons, as to which we think it is not relevant to inquire, there was granted by the carriers to shippers of grain at Nashville the rebilling privilege which we have at the outset described. That is to say, shippers of grain at Nashville, on establishing the receipt at Nashville of grain from Ohio river points equal in quantity to grain proposed to be shipped, received an allowance on the local rate from Nashville to the point of destination which made the rate on the shipment equivalent to what it would have been had the grain originally moved from the Ohio river point to its ultimate point of destination, and not stopped at Nashville at all. We quote a clear illustration of the operation of the privilege taken from the argument at bar of one of the carriers:\n'For example, the local rate on grain from Evansville, on the Ohio river, to Nashville, is 10 cents per 100 pounds, and the local rate from Nashville to Atlanta is 17 cents per 100 pounds. The joint rate from Evansville to Atlanta is 24 cents per 100 pounds, or 3 cents less than the sum of the locals. Under the reshipping practice the joint rate of 24 cents is protected when the shipment has been stopped in transit at Nashville. The local rate of 10 cents from Evansville to Nashville having been paid at the time of the shipment into Nashville, an adjustment \n\n[235 U.S. 314, 325]\n\u00a0\n of the total transportation charge is made when the reshipment to Atlanta occurs, so that the shipper in the end pays upon the shipment the joint rate instead of the combination of local rates into and out of Nashville.'\n\n When the result of this allowance is understood, there seems to be no room for serious controversy that the right to continue the privilege is controlled by the 4th section of the act. The actual shipment from Nashville must either be considered as a movement from Nashville, irrespective of the rate which would have been applicable on a through shipment from an Ohio river point to the same point of destination, or it must be treated by a fiction as one moving from an Ohio river point to the same destination. If the first, then clearly the allowance made of a rate from Nashville to the point of destination was a lesser charge for the longer distance hauled as to such grain than was charged for the shorter distance as to any other grain moving from Nashville to intermediate points, or from such points to places further on, and came clearly within the grasp of the 4th section. If, on the other hand, it be imagined to be a shipment from the Ohio river crossing to the point of destination, upon the theory that the traffic before stoppage at Nashville originated at the Ohio river point, then exactly the same conditions would be reproduced, since the charge as the result of the reduction made was the equivalent of a lesser rate for the longer than for the shorter distance, which, as we have stated, was the prevailing system from Ohio river crossings to points of destination in the southeast.\n It is true that in argument it was said that the question here is whether there was a preference or discrimination under the 2d and 3d sections of the act, and not an inquiry under the 4th section, and that a distinction between the various sections has been recognized. It has, indeed, been held that the provisions of the 2d, 3d, and 4th sections of the act, being in pari materia, required harmonious construction, and therefore they \n\n[235 U.S. 314, 326]\n\u00a0\n should not be applied so that one section destroyed the others, and consequently that a lesser charge for a longer than for a shorter distance permitted by the 4th section could not, for such reason, be held to be either a preference or discrimination under the 2d or 3d sections. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Behlmer, \n175 U.S. 648\n, 44 L. ed. 309, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 209; East Tennessee, V. & G. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n181 U.S. 1\n, 45 L. ed. 719, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 516. But the rule which requires that a practice which is permitted by one section should not be prohibited upon the theory that it is forbidden by another gives no support to the unwarranted assumption that that may be permitted which is devoid of all sanction, and indeed is in direct conflict with all three of the sections,-a result clearly arising in the case before us in consequence of the amendment of  4. Indeed, when the evil which it may be assumed conduced to the adoption of the amendment of the 4th section and the remedy which that amendment was intended to make effective are taken into view (see Intermountain Rate Cases, supra), it would seem that the case before us cogently demonstrates the applicability of the amendment to the situation. And it needs no argument to demonstrate that the application of the principle of public policy which the statute embodies is to be determined by the substance of things, and not by names, for if that were not the case, the provisions of the statute would be wholly inefficacious, as names would readily be devised to accomplish such a purpose.\n It follows from what we have said that the court below was wrong in enjoining the order of the Commission, and, on the contrary, should have dismissed the complaint. The case will therefore be appropriately remanded to enable a decree to that effect to be entered, without prejudice, however, to the right of the carriers to apply to the Commission to be relieved from the operation of the provisions of the 4th section, if they are so advised.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice Pitney concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'That in said investigation, and in arriving at its decision therein, this respondent, as in duty bound under the law, weighed and considered all the facts and arguments presented by the petitioners herein, by other carriers, and all other parties to said proceeding; that in forming its opinion and arriving at its conclusion this respondent, exercising its administrative functions and powers, considered all pertinent facts and matters set forth in many reports and statistics on file with said respondent, together with other facts coming to the knowledge of this respondent in the performance of its duties and functions prescribed and set forth in the acts to regulate commerce and the amendments thereto pertaining to the privileges of rebilling and reshipping; that from said reports and tariffs it appears that said rebilling and reshipping privileges exist at many interior points where no water competition obtains; it is therefore not competent, nor it is relevant, for said petitioners to allege that any particular fact of facts before this respondent in said proceeding are uncontradicted or conclusive in favor of the petitioners' contention; nor can the petitioners by judicial proceeding ascertain each and all the facts circumstances, and conditions in regard to said transportation that were necessarily and properly considered by, and which aided this respondent in arriving at, its conclusions that said practice of rebilling and reshipping said products from Nashville was unduly and unreasonably discriminatory.\n'This respondent denies that there is, or can be, under the law, any complete record of all the evidence, facts, and circumstances before the Commission in determining that this, or any other practice by carriers, is unduly and unjustly discriminatory as between localities or persons, and respondent is advised and so alleges that the determination of said question, as to whether said admitted discrimination is undue and contrary to the provisions of said act to regulate commerce, is one wholly and exclusively within the jurisdiction of this respondent.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","245":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. MAYER(1914)\nNo. 462\nArgued: Decided: November 16, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 55, 56]\n\u00a0\n The facts stated in the certificate may be summarized as follows:\n On March 14th, 1913, one Albert Freeman, with two other individuals, was convicted in the district court, southern district of New York, on five indictments for violation of the statutes relating to the use of the mails and for a conspiracy. On that day judgments of conviction were entered and sentences were imposed as to certain of these indictments, or counts therein, sentence being suspended as to others; and on March 24th, 1913, the defendant Freeman sued out a writ of error from the circuit court of appeals to review the judgments of conviction. Assignments of error were filed; and on May 13th, 1913, the plaintiff in error was admitted to bail by the appellate court. No bill of exceptions has been settled or filed or argument had.\n On January 12th, 1914, the plaintiff in error gave notice of application in the district court to set aside the judgments of conviction, and for the quashing of the indictments, or for a new trial. The grounds were, among \n\n[235 U.S. 55, 57]\n\u00a0\n others, (1) that the defendant had been deprived of a fair trial by the misconduct of an assistant United States attorney; and (2) that one juror, when examined on his voir dire, concealed a bias against the defendant. It is found as a fact by the district judge, that neither the defendant nor his counsel had knowledge of the facts on which the motion was based until after the conclusion of the trial and the expiration of the term as to those counts upon which sentence had been imposed, and that these facts could not have been discovered earlier by reasonable diligence.\n Upon the hearing of the application, District Judge Mayer raised the question of the jurisdiction of the district court to entertain it, in view of the fact that the term had expired. Thereupon the United States attorney submitted a memorandum tendering his consent that the application be heard upon the merits. The application was heard and District Judge Mayer handed down his decision granting a new trial, 'on the ground that defendant had not had a trial by an impartial jury for the reason that one of the jurors at the time of his selection entertained a bias against the defendant, resulting from the juror's observations of the conduct of the defendant and other corporate officers in relation to the production of certain corporate records before a grand jury of which he had been a member, the juror having concealed his bias on his examination on the voir dire for the purpose of securing the jury fees, and the events of the trial having been such as to strengthen and confirm this bias.' The order vacating the judgments of conviction and granting a new trial has not yet been entered, the district judge having filed a memorandum stating in substance that the question of jurisdiction was an important one, and that the order would be withheld until the United States attorney had an opportunity to raise the question in a higher court. \n\n[235 U.S. 55, 58]\n\u00a0\n Thereafter, and on April 6th, 1914, the United States attorney procured an order in the circuit court of appeals, directing District Judge Mayer to show cause why a writ of prohibition should not be issued from that court, forbidding the entry of an order vacating the judgments of conviction and granting a new trial, upon the ground that the district court was without jurisdiction to enter it. Certain of the facts upon which the motion for a new trial was granted do not appear in the record of the previous trial.\n The questions certified are:\n'Question I.\n\n'A. When a writ of error has been issued to review a judgment of conviction in a criminal cause entered in a district court, and thereafter, upon a motion made in the district court after the expiration of the term at which the judgment was entered, said district court has indicated its intention to enter an order vacating the judgment and ordering a new trial on facts discovered after the expiration of said term, and not appearing in the record of the previous trial, has the circuit court of appeals jurisdiction to issue a writ of prohibition against the entry of such order by the district court, when, in the opinion of the circuit court of appeals, the district court is without jurisdiction to enter such order?\n\n'B. Or has the Supreme Court of the United States sole jurisdiction to issue such writ of prohibition, under the circumstances above stated?\n\n'In case question I. A be answered in the affirmative, then--\n\n'Question II.\n\n'When a writ of error has been issued to review a judgment of conviction in a criminal cause entered in a district court, has the district court, upon a motion made after \n\n[235 U.S. 55, 59]\n\u00a0\n the term at which judgment was entered, jurisdiction to set aside the judgment and order a new trial on facts discovered after the expiration of said term, and not appearing in the record of the previous trial?\n\n'Question III.\n\n'Whether, when a district court has itself raised the question of its jurisdiction to entertain a motion made after the expiration of the term, to vacate a judgment of conviction, and the United States attorney thereupon tendered its consent to the hearing of the motion on the merits, if the jurisdictional question raised by the court were dependent on that consent, the United States is debarred by such tender from raising the question of jurisdiction of the district court to vacate said judgment?'\n\n Solicitor General Davis and Mr. Karl W. Kirchwey for the United states. \n\n[235 U.S. 55, 60]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wilson B. Brice and Samuel Williston for Julius M. Mayer.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Hughes:\n\n\n[235 U.S. 55, 65]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Preliminarily, objection is raised to the authority of this court to answer the questions certified. Under  239 of the Judicial Code [36 Stat. at L. 1157, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 228], questions may be certified by the circuit court of appeals 'in any case within its appellate jurisdiction, as defined in section one hundred and twenty-eight;' and  128 provides that the circuit courts of appeals 'shall exercise appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal or writ of error final decisions in the district courts,' etc. The argument is that an application to a circuit court of appeals for a writ of prohibition is an original proceeding. But the jurisdiction of the circuit courts of appeals is exclusively appellate (act of March 3, 1891,  2, 6 [26 Stat. at L. 826, 828, chap. 517, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 547, 549], Judicial Code ,  117, 128; Whitney v. Dick, \n202 \nU.S. 132, 137\n, 138 S., 50 L. ed. 963, 965, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 584); and their authority to issue writs is only that which may properly be deemed to be auxiliary to their appellate power ( Judicial Code, \n\n[235 U.S. 55, 66]\n\u00a0\n  262; Rev. Stat.  716, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 580; act of March 3, 1891, chap. 517,  12, 26 Stat. at L. 826, 829, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 488, 553; Whitney v. Dick, supra; McClellan v. Carland, \n217 \nU.S. 268, 279\n, 280 S., 54 L. ed. 762, 766, 767, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 501). Section 128 defines the class of cases in which the circuit court of appeals may exercise appellate jurisdiction, and, where a case falls within this class, a proceeding to procure the issue of a writ in aid of the exercise of that jurisdiction must be regarded as incidental thereto, and hence as being embraced within the purview of  239, authorizing the court to certify questions of law.\n It is also objected that the certificate sends up the entire case. It is a familiar rule that this court cannot be required through a certificate under  239 to pass upon questions of fact, or mixed questions of law and fact; or to accept a transfer of the whole case; or to answer questions of objectionable generality, which, instead of presenting distinct propositions of law, cover unstated matters 'lurking in the record,' or questions that are hypothetical and speculative.

But, on the other hand, there is no objection to the submission of a definite and clean-cut question of law merely because the answer may be decisive of the controversy. The question propounded must always be such that the answer will aid the court in the determination of the case, and the importance, or the controlling character, of the question, if suitably specific, furnishes no ground for its disallowance. This is abundantly illustrated in the decisions. United States v. Pridgeon, \n153 U.S. 48\n, 38 L. ed. 631, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 746; Helwig v. United States, 188 U.

B-are clearly pertinent.\n Coming, then, to the matters thus submitted, we deem the following considerations to be controlling:\n\n 1. \nIn the absence of statute providing otherwise, the general principle obtains that a court cannot set aside or alter its final judgment after the expiration of the term at which it was entered, unless the proceeding for that purpose was begun during that term.

In the case of courts of common law,-and we are not here concerned with the special grounds upon which courts of equity afford relief,-the court at a subsequent term has power to correct inaccuracies in mere matters of form, or clerical errors, and, in civil cases, to rectify such mistakes of fact as were reviewable on writs of error coram nobis, or coram vobis, for which the proceeding by motion is the modern substitute.

These writs were available to bring before the court that pronounced the judgment errors in matters of fact which had not been put in issue or passed upon, and were material to the validity and regularity of the legal proceeding itself; as where the defendant, being under age, appeared by attorney, or the plaintiff or defendant was a married woman at the time of commencing the suit, or died before verdict or interlocutory judgment,-for, it was said, 'error in fact is not the error of the judges, and reversing it is not reversing their own judgment.' So, if there were error in the process, or through the default of the clerks, the same proceeding might be had to procure a reversal. But if the error were 'in the judgment itself, and not in the process,' a writ of error did not lie in the same court upon the judgment, but only in another and superior court. 2 Tidd, Pr. 9th ed. 1136, 1137; Stephen, Pl. 119; 1 Rolle, Abr. 746, 747, 749. In criminal cases, however, error would lie in the King's bench whether the error was in fact or law. 2 Tidd, Pr. 1137; 3 Bacon, Abr. Bouvier's ed. 'Error,' 366; Chitty, Crim. Law, 156, 749. See United States v. Plumer, 3 Cliff. 28, 59, 60, Fed. Cas. No. 16,056. The errors of law which were thus subject to examination were only those disclosed by the record; and, as the record was so drawn up that it did not show errors in the reception or rejection of evidence, or misdirections by the judge, the remedy applied 'only to that very small number of legal questions' which concerned 'the regularity of the proceedings themselves.' See Report, Royal Commission on Criminal Code (1879) p. 37; 1 Stephen, History of Crim. Law, 309, 310.\n In view of the statutory and limited jurisdiction of the Federal district courts, and of the specific provisions for the review of their judgments on writ of error, there would appear to be no basis for the conclusion that, after the term, these courts in common-law actions, whether civil or \n\n[235 U.S. 55, 69]\n\u00a0\n criminal, can set aside or modify their final judgments for errors of law; and even if it be assumed that in the case of errors in certain matters of fact, the district courts may exercise in criminal cases-as an incident to their powers expressly granted-a correctional jurisdiction at subsequent terms analogous to that exercised at common law on writs of error coram nobis (see Bishop, New Crim. Proc. 2d ed.  1369), as to which we express no opinion, that authority would not reach the present case. This jurisdiction was of limited scope; the power of the court thus to vacate its judgments for errors of fact existed, as already stated, in those cases where the errors were of the most fundamental character; that is, such as rendered the proceeding itself irregular and invalid. In cases of prejudicial misconduct in the course of the trial, the misbehavior or partiality of jurors, and newly discovered evidence, as well as where it is sought to have the court in which the case was tried reconsider its rulings, the remedy is by a motion for a new trial (Judicial Code,  269),- an application which is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and, in accordance with the established principles which have been repeatedly set forth in the decisions of this court above cited, cannot be entertained, in the absence of a different statutory rule, after the expiration of the term at which the judgment was entered.\n State statutes relating to the granting of new trials are not applicable. As was said by this court in Bronson v. Schulten, \n104 \nU.S. 410, 417\n, 26 S. L. ed. 797, 800: 'The question relates to the power of the courts, and not to the mode of procedure. It is whether there exists in the court the authority to set aside, vacate, and modify its final judgments after the term at which they were rendered; and this authority can neither be conferred upon nor withheld from the courts of the United States by the statutes of a state or the practice of its courts.'

This consideration is without pertinency here, for there was no general jurisdiction over the subject-matter, and it is not a question of the waiver of mere 'modal or formal' requirements, of mere private right or personal privilege. In a Federal court of competent jurisdiction, final judgment of conviction had been entered and sentence had been imposed. The judgment was subject to review in the appellate court, but, so far as the trial court was concerned, it was a finality; the subsequent proceeding was, in effect, a new proceeding, which, by reason of its character, invoked an authority not possessed. In these circumstances it would seem to be clear that the consent of the prosecuting officer could not alter the case; he was not a dispensing power to give or withhold jurisdiction. The established rule embodies the policy of the law that litigation be finally terminated, and when the matter is thus placed beyond the discretion of the court, it is not confided to the discretion of the prosecutor.\n\n 3. \nWe have no occasion to enter upon the broad in- \n\n[235 U.S. 55, 71]\n\u00a0\n quiry suggested by the argument as to the authority of the circuit courts of appeals to issue writs of prohibition. We have no doubt of the power to issue the writ in the case stated, and we need not discuss other cases supposed. Prior to the application for a new trial in the district court, the defendant had sued out a writ of error, and the appellate jurisdiction of the circuit court of appeals had attached. Brooks v. Norris, 11 How. 204, 207, 13 L. ed. 665, 666; Re Chetwood, \n165 \nU.S. 443, 456\n, 41 S. L. ed. 782, 786, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 385; Mutual L. Ins. Co. v. Phinney, \n178 \nU.S. 327, 335\n, 44 S.

Rep. 221.\n Basing the argument upon the proposition that the government had no right of review in the circuit court of appeals in a criminal case, it is urged that the government cannot be regarded as deprived of any relief which it is entitled to seek from that court, and hence that it cannot be said that the issue of the writ was necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction. Judicial Code,  262. But the case was actually pending in the circuit court of appeals on the defendant's writ of error, and the goverment had all the rights of a litigant in that court seeking to maintain a judgment assailed. It is said that the defendant could have procured the dismissal of his writ, but in fact the writ had not been dismissed. It is said, also, that the consent to the hearing by the district court of the application for a new trial operated as a waiver of any rights the government could have in the circuit court of appeals. This conclusion is sought to be derived from the asserted efficacy of the consent in the lower court, and, as we have seen, it had no efficacy there, and it had no reference whatever to the proceedings in the higher court. The defendant was still insisting upon his rights as plaintiff in error in the circuit court of appeals, and the United States, as the opposing party in that court, was entitled to its aid in order to preserve the integrity of the record and to prevent unauthorized action by the court below with respect to the judgment \n\n[235 U.S. 55, 72]\n\u00a0\n under review. For this purpose, the writ of prohibition was the appropriate remedy.\n We answer question I. A in the affirmative, and questions II. and III. in the negative. Question I.

S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1653), for placing a letter in the postoffice for delivery by the postoffice establishment for the purpose of executing a scheme to defraud. The scheme alleged was to send out puzzle pictures, advertising as a prize for the neatest correct answer a credit order for $350 on a certain piano, one for $300 for the next neatest, and others for $200 for correct answers. Persons answering were to be told that they were entitled, for instance, to an order for $200 on a piano sold the world over for $300, which would cost them $75 cash with the order. The credit was to be a pretense, as the piano to be delivered was to be one of a retail price not exceeding the cash received. It was not alleged that the piano was to be worth less than the cash paid, but, as is manifest, people were to be led into the dealing by the delusive apparatus of a promise known to be false when made ( Durland v. United States, \n161 U.S. 306\n, 40 L. ed. 709, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 508), and false statements as to the value of the piano bought. The indictment was demurred to and the dumurrer was sustained.\n It will not be necessary to decide whether the facts alleged show a scheme to defraud, since it does not appear on what ground the court acted. As was said in United States v. Carter (Dec. 15, 1913 [\n231 U.S. 492\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 173]): 'There is nothing in the record showing any request made to the trial court for an expression of opinion in such form as to manifest clearly whether its action proceeded upon a construction of the statute, or merely upon the meaning which was given to the indictment.' As it does not appear that the judgment \n\n[231 U.S. 701, 703]\n\u00a0\n turned upon any controverted construction of the statute, the writ of error must be dismissed in this case as in that. It is unnecessary to consider whether every determination concerning the common law of fraud taken for granted by the act would be a decision based upon the construction of the statute, within the meaning of the act of March 2, 1907, chap. 2564, 34 Stat. at L. 1246\n\n\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","247":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. NIXON(1914)\nNo. 427\nArgued: Decided: November 30, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 231, 232]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Underwood for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. W. F. Evans and W. S. Cowherd for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar delivered the opinion of the court:\n The grand jury for the western division of the western district of Missouri returned an indictment against the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Company and its receivers, charging that on August 16, 1913, Nixon, Biddle, and West, as receivers of said company, were operating the property and business of said corporation as a common carrier of freight, and unlawfully transported cattle from a quarantine district in Oklahoma to Kansas City, Missouri, without compliance with the rules and regulations established by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n Both the indorsement and caption to this indictment described it as being for 'violation of  2 and 4 of the act of March 3, 1905 (33 Stat. at L. 1264, chap. 1496, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1351).' Those sections of that act provide that 'no railroad company . . . shall transport from any quarantine state . . . to any other state any cattle . . . ' except 'in com- \n\n[235 U.S. 231, 233]\n\u00a0\n pliance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture.'\n The defendants demurred on the ground 'that the indictment does not charge any offense for which receivers herein can be held.' The court treated the indictment as founded on the act of 1905, imposing a penalty upon railroad companies, and after argument sustained the demurrer, filing a memorandum in which he held that, under the ruling in United States v. Harris, \n177 U.S. 305\n, 44 L. ed. 780, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 609, the statute did not create an offense for which receivers could be punished.\n The case is here under the criminal appeals act [34 Stat. at L. 1246, chap. 2564] on a writ of error in which the government excepts generally to the quashing of the indictment and specially to the court's construction of this act of 1905\n\n\n In view of the decision in United States v. Harris, the judgment of the court below would necessarily have to be affirmed if the case was to be determined solely by the provisions of the quarantine act of 1905, which imposes a penalty for the transportation of cattle by a railroad company. But a receiver is not a corporation, and, therefore, not within the terms of a statute applicable to railroad companies, even though cattle from an infected district transported by him would be as likely to transmit disease as if they had been shipped over the same line while it was being operated by the company itself. And, no doubt in recognition of this fact, and in order to make the remedy as broad as the evil sought to be cured, Congress, by the act of March 4, 1913 (37 Stat. at L. 831, chap. 145), made all of the provisions of the original quarantine act of 1905 'apply to any railroad company or other common carrier whose road or line forms any part of a route over which cattle or other live stock are transported in the course of a shipment' from a quarantine state to any other state.\n The statute, as thus amended, applied to transportation of live stock over short lines belonging to private individ- \n\n[235 U.S. 231, 234]\n\u00a0\n uals or to lumber companies hauling freight for hire; to roads operated by trustees under power contained in a mortgage; and also to the more common case where a railroad was being operated by a receiver acting under judicial appointment. For in so far as he transports passengers and property he is a common carrier with rights and civil responsibility as such (Eddy v. Lafayette, \n163 U.S. 464\n, 41 L. ed. 228, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1082; Hutchinson, Carr.  77). And there is no reason suggested why a receiver, operating a railroad, should not also be subject to the penal provisions of a statute prohibiting any common carrier from transporting live stock by rail from a quarantine district into another state. Erb v. Morasch, \n177 U.S. 584\n, 44 L. ed. 897, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 819; United States v. Ramsey, 42 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1031, 116 C. C. A. 568, 197 Fed. 144.\n But it is said that the amendment, buried in the agricultural appropriation act of 1913, was unknown to the grand jury when the indictment was found, and was not construed in deciding the motion to quash. And it is contended that, inasmuch as the criminal appeals act only authorizes a review of a decision in so far as it was 'based upon the . . . construction of the statute upon which the indictment was founded' (34 Stat. at L. 1246, chap. 2564), the correct ruling that receivers are not within the act of 1905 ought not to be reversed because it now appears that they are within the terms of the act of 1913, which was not brought to the attention of the district judge, and was not therefore construed by him in fact. It is pointed out that while there is a general assignment that the court erred in quashing the indictment, yet the government itself specifically complains of the court's construction of the act of 1905-not the act of 1913. And to emphasize the fact that the indictment was not founded on the amendment, attention is called to the fact that entries on the back and in the caption of the indictment described it as being for 'violation of  2 and 4 of the act of March 3, 1905 (33 Stat. at L. \n\n[235 U.S. 231, 235]\n\u00a0\n 1264, chap. 1496, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1351),' which apply to railroad companies, and not to receivers.\n These entries are useful and convenient means of reference, and in case of doubt might possibly be of some assistance in determining what statute was alleged to have been violated. But these entries form no part of the indictment (Williams v. United States, \n168 U.S. 389\n, 42 L. ed. 512, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 92) and neither add to nor take from the legal effect of the charge that the receivers, while operating the business of the corporation as a common carrier, transported cattle 'contrary to the form of the statute in such cases made and provided.' What was that statute and on what statute the indictment was founded was to be determined as a matter of law from the facts therein charged.\n There is no claim that it was quashed because of any defect in matter of pleading, and that being true, the ruling on the demurrer that 'the indictment does not charge any offense for which the receivers can be held' necessarily involved a decision of the question as to whether there was any statute which punished the acts therein set out. In determining that question it was necessary that the indictment should be referred, not merely to the act mentioned in argument, but to any statute which prohibited the transportation of cattle by the persons, in the manner, and on the date charged in that indictment. For the reasons already pointed out it was a misconstruction of the act of 1913, to which the indictment was thus legally referred, to hold that receivers acting as common carriers were not within its terms.\n Nor can a reversal be avoided by the claim that the act of 1913, though applicable to the facts charged in the indictment, had not been construed by the court. For within the meaning of the criminal appeals act ( 34 Stat. at L. 1246, chap. 2564) the statute on which, as matter of law, an indictment is founded, may be misconstrued not only by* misinter- \n\n[235 U.S. 231, 236]\n\u00a0\n preting its language, but by overlooking its existence and failing to apply its provisions to an indictment which sets out facts constituting a violation of its terms. It is 'a solecism to say that the decision that the acts charged are not within the statute is not based upon a construction of it.' United States v. Patten, \n226 U.S. 535\n, 57 L. ed. 338, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 325, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 141. It would, of course, be fairer to the trial judge to call his attention to the existence of the act on which the indictment was based (United States v. George, \n228 U.S. 18\n, 57 L. ed. 714, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 412). Yet an indictment must set out facts, and not the law; and when he sustained the demurrer on the ground that the shipment therein stated did not constitute a crime of which the receivers could be convicted, he in legal effect held that they were not liable to prosecution if, while operating a road as common carrier, they hauled live stock from a quarantine state to another. In rendering that decision he made a ruling of the very kind which the United States was entitled to have reviewed under the provisions of the criminal appeals act (34 Stat. at L. 1246, chap. 2564). If that were not so the right of the government could in any case be defeated by entering a general order of dismissal, without referring to the statute which was involved, or without giving the reasons on which the decision was based.\n The error can no more be cured by the fact that the existence of the statute was not called to the attention of the court than the receivers, on the trial before the jury, could excuse themselves by proof that they did not know of the passage of the amendment which made it unlawful for them to transport cattle by rail from a quarantine state in interstate commerce.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","248":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

Lewis for appellees in No. 508.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n By the act of Congress of June 29, 1906, chap. 3591, 34 Stat. at L. 584, the act to regulate commerce was amended so that the 1st section reads in part as follows: 'That the provisions of this act shall apply to any corporation or any person or persons engaged in the transportation of \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 558]\n\u00a0\n oil or other commodity, except water and except natural or artificial gas, by means of pipe lines, or partly by pipe lines and partly by railroad, or partly by pipe lines and partly by water, who shall be considered and held to be common carriers within the meaning and purpose of this act.' Thereafter the Interstate Commerce Commission issued an order requiring the appellees, among others, being parties in control of pipe lines, to file with the Commission schedules of their rates and charges for the transportation of oil. 24 Inters. Com. Rep. 1. The appellees thereupon brought suit in the commerce court to set aside and annul the order, and a preliminary injunction was issued by that court, on the broad ground that the statute applies to every pipe line that crosses a state boundary, and that thus construed it is unconstitutional, 204 Fed. 798. The United States, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and other intervening respondents appealed.\n The circumstances in which the amendment was passed are known to everyone. The Standard Oil Company, a New Jersey corporation, owned the stock of the New York Transit Company, a pipe line made a common carrier by the laws of New York, and of the National Transit Company, a Pennsylvania corporation of like character, and by these it connected the Appalachian oil field with its refineries in the east. It owned nearly all the stock of the Ohio Oil Company, which connected the Lima-Indiana field with its system; and the National Transit Company, controlled by it, owned nearly all the stock of the Prairie Oil & Gas Company, which ran from the mid-continent field in Oklahoma and Kansas and the Caddo field in Louisiana to Indiana, and connected with the previously mentioned lines. It also was largely interested in the Tide Water Pipe Company, Limited, which connected with the Appalachian and other fields and pursued the methods of the Standard Oil Company about to be described. By the before- mentioned and subordinate \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 559]\n\u00a0\n lines the Standard Oil Company had made itself master of the only practicable oil transportation between the oil fields east of California and the Atlantic ocean, and carried much the greater part of the oil between those points. Before the recent dissolution, the New York and Pennsylvania companies had extended their lines into New Jersey and Maryland to the refineries, and the laws of those states did not require them to be common carriers. To meet the present amendment the Standard Oil Company took a conveyance of the New Jersey and Maryland lines, and the common carrier lines now end at insignificant places where there are neither market nor appliances except those of the Standard Oil, by which it would seem that the whole transport of the carriers' lines is received. There is what seems to be merely a formal breach of continuity when the carriers' pipes stop. The change is not material to our view of the case.\n Availing itself of its monopoly of the means of transportation the Standard Oil Company refused, through its subordinates, to carry any oil unless the same was sold to it or to them, and through them to it, on terms more or less dictated by itself. In this way it made itself master of the fields without the necessity of owning them, and carried across half the continent a great subject of international commerce coming from many owners, but, by the duress of which the Standard Oil Company was master, carrying it all as its own. The main question is whether the act does and constitutionally can apply to the several constituents that then had been united into a single line.\n Taking up first the construction of the statute, we think it plain that it was intended to reach the combination of pipe lines that we have described. The provisions of the act are to apply to any person engaged in the transportation of oil by means of pipe lines. The words 'who shall be considered and held to be common carriers within the meaning and purpose of this act' obviously are not in- \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 560]\n\u00a0\n tended to cut down the generality of the previous declaration to the meaning that only those shall be held common carriers within the act who were common carriers in a technical sense, but an injunction that those in control of pipe lines and engaged in the transportation of oil shall be dealt with as such. If the Standard Oil Company and its cooperating companies were not so engaged no one was. It not only would be a sacrifice of fact to form, but would empty the act if the carriage to the seaboard of nearly all the oil east of California were held not to be transportation within its meaning, because by the exercise of their power the carriers imposed as a condition to the carriage a sale to themselves. As applied to them, while the amendment does not compel them to continue in operation, it does require them not to continue except as common carriers. That is the plain meaning, as has been held with regard to other statutes similarly framed. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Riverside Mills, \n219 \nU.S. 186, 195\n, 203 S., 55 L. ed. 167, 178, 181, 31 L.R.A.(N.S.) 7, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 164. Its evident purpose was to bring within its scope pipe lines that, although not technically common carriers, yet were carrying all oil offered, if only the offerers would sell at their price.\n The only matter requiring much consideration is the constitutionality of the act. That the transportation is commerce among the states we think clear. That conception cannot be made wholly dependent upon technical questions of title, and the fact that the oils transported belonged to the owner of the pipe line is not conclusive against the transportation being such commerce.

The situation that we have described would make it illusory to deny the title of commerce to such transportation, beginning in purchase and ending in sale, for the same reasons that make it transportation within the act.\n The control of Congress over commerce among the \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 561]\n\u00a0\n states cannot be made a means of exercising powers not intrusted to it by the Constitution, but it may require those who are common carriers in substance to become so in form. So far as the statute contemplates future pipe lines and prescribes the conditions upon which they may be established there can be no doubt that it is valid. So the objection is narrowed to the fact that it applies to lines already engaged in transportation. But, as we already have intimated, those lines that we are considering are common carriers now in everything but form. They carry everybody's oil to a market, although they compel outsiders to sell it before taking it into their pipes. The answer to their objection is not that they may give up the business, but that, as applied to them, the statute practically means no more than they must give up requiring a sale to themselves before carrying the oil that they now receive. The whole case is that the appellees, if they carry, must do it in a way that they do not like. There is no taking and it does not become necessary to consider how far Congress could subject them to pecuniary loss without compensation in order to accomplish the end in view. Hoke v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 308, 323\n, 57 S. L. ed. 523, 527, 43 L.R.A.(N.S.) 906, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 281, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 905; Lottery Case (Champion v. Ames) \n188 \nU.S. 321, 357\n, 47 S. L. ed. 492, 501, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 321, 13 Am. Crim. Rep. 561.\n These considerations seem to us sufficient to dispose of the cases of the Standard Oil Company, the Ohio Oil Company, the Prairie Oil & Gas Company, and the Tide Water Pipe Company, Limited. The Standard Oil Company of Louisiana was incorporated since the passage of the amendment, and before the beginning of this suit, to break up the monopoly of the New Jersey Standard Oil Company. It buys a large part of its oil from the Prairie Oil & Gas Company, which buys it at the wells in the mid-continent field and transfers the title to the Louisiana Company in that state. Its case also is covered by what we have said.\n There remains to be considered only the Uncle Sam Oil \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 562]\n\u00a0\n Company. This company has a refinery in Kansas and oil wells in Oklahoma, with a pipe line connecting the two which it has used for the sole purpose of conducting oil from its own wells to its own refinery. It would be a perversion of language, considering the sense in which it is used in the statute, to say that a man was engaged in the transportation of water whenever he pumped a pail of water from his well to his house. So as to oil. When, as in this case, a company is simply drawing oil from its own wells across a state line to its own refinery, for its own use, and that is all, we do not regard it as falling within the description of the act, the transportation being merely an incident to use at the end. In that case the decree will be affirmed. In the others the decree will be reversed.\n No. 507, decree affirmed.\n Nos. 481, 482, 483, 506, and 508, decrees reversed.\n\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, concurring:\n Agreeing in every particular with the conclusions of the court and with its reasoning except as to the one special subject, my concurrence as to that matter, because of its importance, is separately stated. The matter to which I refer is the exclusion of the Uncle Sam Oil Company from the operation of the act. The view which leads the court to exclude it is that the company was not engaged in transportation under the statute,-a conclusion to which I do not assent. The facts are these: That company owns wells in one state from which it has pipe lines to its refinery in another state, and pumps its own oil through such pipe lines to its refinery; and the product, of course, when reduced at the refinery, passes into the markets of consumption. It seems to me that the business thus carried on is transportation in interstate commerce within the statute. But despite this I think the company is not \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 563]\n\u00a0\n embraced by the statute because it would be impossible to make the statute applicable to it without violating the due process clause of the 5th Amendment, since to apply it would necessarily amount to a taking of the property of the company without compensation. It is shown beyond question that the company buys no oil, and by the methods which have been mentioned simply carries its own product to its own refinery; in other words, it is engaged in a purely private business. Under these conditions in my opinion there is no power under the Constitution without the exercise of the right of eminent domain to convert without its consent the private business of the company into a public one.\n Of course this view has no application to the other companies which the court holds are subject to the act, because, as pointed out, the principal ones were chartered as common carriers, and they all, either directly or as a necessary result of their association, were engaged in buying oil and shipping it through their pipes; in other words, were doing in reality a common carrier business, disguised, it may be, in form, but not changed in substance. Under these conditions I do not see how it would be possible to avoid the conclusion which the court has reached without declaring that the shadow, and not the substance, was the criterion to be resorted to for the purpose of determining the validity of the exercise of legislative power.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, dissenting:\n I am unable to concur in the judgment of the court or in the reasoning upon which it is based. I pass by the construction of the amendment of June 29, 1906, set out in the opinion, although its application to the business of appellee companies is in controversy. I shall assume its application, therefore, and pass to the other and more serious questions. Extended discussion \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 564]\n\u00a0\n of them is not now possible. Indeed, any discussion may not be worth while, as I express only my individual views. In order to be brief, I have to refer to the principles of the decision of the court, and indeed I am impelled more to dissent from them than from the judgment. It is of little consequence, aside from the rights of the appellee companies, whether they are subject to be regulated as common carriers, but it is of great consequence whether the sanctions of property be impaired.\n The outside principle of the decision is the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce; but to assert that power solves none of the difficulties of the questions in the case. I need not pause to demonstrate that the exercise of that power is subject to other provisions of the Constitution, and one of those provisions is invoked by the appellees. It is contended that the act offends the 5th Amendment in that it takes their property without due process of law. But what is due process of law, and wherein does its requirement limit the power of Congress? Neither question can be answered in a word, and the usual considerations are encountered when the courts are called upon to investigate the limits of legislative power. Autocracy is free from such perplexities. When authority can say, 'The State-it is I!' it meets no impediments to its exercise. But that extreme illustration is not necessary. Even a government under a Constitution, if it be unwritten, may have a power that leaves nothing for the courts to do other than to enforce the fiats of legislative authority. Under a written Constitution, however, there is a sovereignty superior to the legislature, that of the people expressed in the Constitution. How to reconcile legislation with the limitations of the Constitution and leave government practical in its exercise is a problem which comes to this court often. It is the problem in the case at bar. It is to be regretted that there is no indisputable standard for its solution,-no indisputable test of \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 565]\n\u00a0\n due process of law. We know that an act of legislation does not necessarily satisfy it. It may, however, be sufficient, or, to be more careful and accurate, there may be a regulation of the uses of property whose legality cannot be denied. Regulation is not a taking, and we are brought to the inquiry, what uses of property will subject it to regulation? I mean regulation in a special sense, not in the sense in which all property, whether its uses be public or private, is subject to regulation. 'Property,' it is said, 'becomes clothed with a public interest when used in a manner to make it of public consequence, and affect the community at large.' 'When, therefore, one devotes his property to a use in which the public has an interest, he, in effect, grants to the public an interest in that use, and must submit to be controlled by the public for the common good, to the extent of the interest he has thus created.' Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n, 24 L. ed. 77; Budd v. New York, \n143 U.S. 517\n, 36 L. ed. 247, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 45, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 468; Brass v. North Dakota, \n153 U.S. 391\n, 38 L. ed. 757, 4 Inters. Com. Rep. 670, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 857; German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, \n233 U.S. 389\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 612. Manifestly the principle needs the definition of the facts of the cases. In three of them the fees for storage of grain were regulated; in the other the price of fire insurance; but dominant in all, as giving character to the property, was the fact that its use was voluntarily offered to the public. There was no compulsion of use or service. This must be kept in mind as the determining circumstance. Conduct may be regulated which cannot be initially commanded. The rates of interest may be regulated, but loans cannot be compelled. There is further illustration in a case subsequent to those cited. In W. W. Cargill Co. v. Minnesota, \n180 U.S. 452\n, 45 L. ed. 619, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 423, an injunction was sought against the operation of an elevator and warehouse situated on the right of way of a railroad until its operator should have obtained a license from the railroad and warehouse commission of the state under a law of the state. The defendant company bought and sold grain, although its \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 566]\n\u00a0\n elevator was used for storing its own grain only. The state court decided that the business was of a 'public character,' and was 'sufficiently affected with a public interest to warrant a very considerable amount of regulation of it by the state.' This conclusion was put upon the ground that the elevator was a kind of public market place, and it was important to see that correct weights were had, uniform grades given, proper amount of dockage taken, and no dishonest practice allowed. The provision for a license was sustained. The act, however, provided for many other regulations, among others, for the receipt and storage of the grain of others and the rates of charges therefor. The state court, passing on these and other regulations, said that there were many provisions in the act which applied only to warehouses and elevators in which grain was stored for others or for the public, and which could not apply to such warehouses as the one in question, and there were perhaps provisions in the act which it would be unconstitutional to apply to such warehouses. The court, however, said: 'Such matters need not be considered at this time. The provision recognizing license is not one of these.' One of the judges of the court was of opinion that, on account of the interdependence of the provisions of the act, many of them, when applied to warehouses not used for the storage of grain by others, were beyond the police power of the state, and therefore invalid, and made the whole act so. This court, by Mr. Justice Harlan, sustained the judgment of the state court and said 'that the mere requirement of a license was not forbidden by the 14th Amendment.' Answering the suggestion that other provisions were repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, it was said that the license would give authority to carry on the business under the valid laws of the state and the valid regulations of the commission. The case, therefore, manifestly decides that the use of the warehouse by others could not \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 567]\n\u00a0\n have been legally compelled, and in the other cases, as we have seen, it was the act of the parties, not the power of the law, which devoted the property to the public interest. In the Munn Case it was said of the owners of the elevators that there was no attempt to compel them 'to grant the public an interest in their property, but to declare their obligations if they used it in this particular manner.' And further, 'He may withdraw his grant by discontinuing the use; but so long as he maintains the use, he must submit to the control.'\n In the cases cited, therefore, there was a regulation of uses which were extended voluntarily to others. I recall no case where the use was compelled, and by the use so compelled regulation was justified. The case at bar has no fellow in our jurisprudence.\n These considerations are not touched upon in the opinion of the court, and how far they affect the decision can only be conjectured. It may be not at all. At any rate, other considerations are given explicit prominence. The impulse of the amendment is said to be the control which the Standard Oil Company had acquired over the pipe-line transportation of oil. It is further said that it availed 'itself of its monopoly of the means of transportation' by refusing to carry 'through its subordinates any oil unless the same was sold to them, and through them to it on terms more or less dictated by itself, and thereby became master of the fields without owning them.' It is not very clear whether this is intended as a statement merely of the motive of the amendment or of its legal justification. If stated as the motive of the amendment, I have no concern with it; as a justification of the amendment, its foundation must be considered.\n The facts of the cases the opinion of the court does not give. They are, however, quite necessary to a discussion of the questions which they present. I quote the summary of the commerce court: \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 568]\n\u00a0\n 'The Prairie Oil & Gas Company is a corporation organized in 1900 under the laws of the state of Kansas. It owns and operates a system of pipe lines consisting of gathering lines in the mid-continent field, in the states of Kansas and Oklahoma, a trunk line from that field to Griffith in the state of Indiana, where it connects with the Indiana pipe line, and a trunk line in the state of Arkansas, connecting the Oklahoma pipe line with the pipe line of the Standard Oil Company of Louisiana. This company has no refinery, and its business is confined to producing, purchasing, and selling crude oil, which it delivers to its customers by means of the pipe lines described. Its own wells yield only about 12,000 barrels per day and it purchases approximately 70,000 barrels per day on the average. Its trunk lines are about 860 miles in length, of which some 300 miles are located on the right of way of the Atchison, Topeka, & Sante Fe Railway Company under contract arrangement with that company.\n'The Uncle Sam Oil Company is a corporation organized in 1905 under the laws of the state (then territory) of Arizona. It owns and operates a pipe line from its wells in the state of Oklahoma to its refinery at Cherryvale, Kansas. The extent to which this company purchases oil from other producers, if it engages in that business at all, does not appear from the record.\n\n'Robert D. Benson et al. are the members of a partnership, organized in 1878 for the term of twenty years, and reorganized in 1898 for a further term of twenty years, in compliance with the laws of the state of Pennsylvania, and doing business under the name of the Tide-Water Pipe Company (Ltd.). This company transports oil from the Appalachian field in the western part of Pennsylvania, and also oil received through connecting lines from other fields, to the Tide-Water Oil Company refinery at Bayonne, in the state of New Jersey. It also owns and operates branch lines in New York and Pennsylvania, and a line extending \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 569]\n\u00a0\n from Stoy, Illinois, through the states of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The greater part of the crude oil transported by this company is purchased from other producers. The lines which it owns and the Bayonne refinery which it serves are under common or unified control.\n\n'The Ohio Oil Company is a corporation organized in 1887 under the laws of the state of Ohio. It owns and operates pipe lines in the states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and also leases and operates a line from Negley, Ohio, to Centerbridge, in the state of Pennsylvania. It is an extensive purchaser of crude oil from other producers.\n\n'The Standard Oil Company, designated, for convenience, 'Standard Oil Company of New Jersey,' is a corporation organized in 1882 under the laws of the state of New Jersey, and its principal pipe lines are the following : (a) A line extending from Unionville, in the state of New York, near the boundary line of New Jersey, through the latter state to its refineries at Bayonne; (b) a line from Centerbridge, in the state of Pennsylvania, near the boundary of New Jersey, through the latter state to its refineries at Bayonne and Bayway; and (c) a line from Fawn Grove, in the state of Pennsylvania, near the boundary of Maryland, through the latter state to its refinery at Baltimore. The record indicates that much the greater part of the oil transported through these lines, and perhaps all of it, is oil which this company has purchased.\n\n'The Standard Oil Company of Louisiana is a corporation organized in 1909 under the laws of that state. It owns and operates a refinery at Baton Rouge and a trunk line extending thereto from the town of Ida, near the northern line of Louisiana, and also gathering lines in the Caddo field, in the states of Louisiana and Texas. It purchases a considerable part of the crude oil which its lines transport.\n\n'None of the petitioning corporations is organized or \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 570]\n\u00a0\n derives any of its corporate powers from laws of the state of its creation under which common carrier or other public service corporations are organized, but each of them was formed and has always conducted its operations under and in compliance with state laws which relate to private as distinguished from public business.'\n\n The companies do not possess the right of eminent domain, and their lines are laid over private rights of way, except some of them for short distances have laid their lines along the rights of way of certain railroads under some contract arrangement with the railroads, one of them for a distance of about 300 miles. They, however, have in many instances also laid their lines across or along public streets and highways by permission or consent of the local authorities. None of them has ever held itself out as a common carrier, or in fact ever carried oil for others, but they have carried only such oil as they produced from their own wells or purchased from other producers, and which they owned when the transportation took place.\n Concluding its recitation of facts, the commerce court said: 'In short, so far as their legal status is fixed by the laws of the states of their creation, and so far as their acts and attitude could make them such, all the petitioners [appellee companies] carry on a private business, at least, in the sense that they transport only their own oil, and have always refused to transport for others; and all of them have evidently sought and claimed to so conduct their operations as to avoid any public activity which might subject them to public regulation.'\n These being the facts, it is yet insisted that the appellee companies are common carriers 'in substance,' and Congress by its action has only made them so 'in form,' and that this is unquestionably within the power of Congress. But there is something more to be considered than an antithesis of words. There is an antithesis of \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 571]\n\u00a0\n legal consequences,-the subjecting of property to other uses than those of its owner. A manifest taking, therefore.\n But let me get away from any appearance of considering words or forms of expression to an estimation of the facts. The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey is made prominent, and the exemplar of all of the other companies, and its stock ownership in some of them is assumed to destroy their individuality and unite them all in operation, character, and effect. Indeed, it is represented as the single controlling force and master of the transportation of oil 'between the oil fields east of California and the Atlantic ocean.' Under its sway are pictured all the other companies except the Standard Oil of Louisiana, the latter company, however, having a baneful potency of dictation to the other owners in the oil fields, as has its exemplar, the Standard Oil of New Jersey. In other words, it is argued, the companies have made themselves masters of their respective fields by the constraint of the sale of the oil of other owners to them upon terms more or less dicated by them by availing themselves of their 'monopoly of the means of transportation.' This is the charge. The facts of the case do not sustain it except as they exhibit the advantages of the possession of property which others do not possess. Must it be shared by those others for that reason? The conception of property is exclusiveness, the rights of exclusive possession, enjoyment, and disposition. Take away these rights and you take all that there is of property. Take away any of them, force a participation in any of them, and you take property to that extent. These are commonplaces, but at times-it may be always-commonplaces are our best guides when rights are concerned. They are pertinent to this case. The employment of one's wealth to construct or purchase facilities for one's business greater than others possess constitutes no monopoly that does not appertain to all property. Such facilities may give \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 572]\n\u00a0\n advantages, and, it may be, power; so does all property and in proportion to its extent. It may well, then, be asked-What extent of trade advantages, what degree of power in purchasing, what superiority in facilities of transportation or disposition of articles may be grounds of the exercise of congressional control? If the owner of a small oil well may be given rights in the facilities of the appellee companies, why may not the owner of a small business be given rights in the facilities of a larger business, if Congress sees fit to say that the public welfare requires the gift? Can any privilege be claimed for oil that cannot be claimed for other commodities? May a jobber of merchandise in Washington who conducts a trade in Baltimore and other places, and owns special facilities for the transportation of his merchandise, be compelled to share them with competitors who may not be able to afford as ample ones, and in consequence be forced to sell their property to him at a disadvantage? Or, recurring to the illustration of W. W. Cargill Co. v. Minnesota, can one who erects elevators for the storage of grain of his own raising (such instances exist), and uses it as well for grain of his purchase (there are more of such instances), be compelled to share their advantage with other growers or purchasers of grain? The advantages of his situation are quite as manifest as the advantages the appellees enjoy, and the effect on interstate commerce transportation as marked. Upon the same principle, one who builds a railroad to a coal field or to a forest must share it with other owners in the field or forest if the ventures to purchase their productions. Such is the principle of the present decision. Under it what attribute of private property is left?\n Let us not exaggerate the conditions or by form of statement put out of view essential elements. What duress is employed that is not employed when terms are exacted as a condition of the use of property? Or, rather, \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 573]\n\u00a0\n and more accurately, what duress is used except the exclusion of others from the use of property which they do not own? There were no prior or present rights in other owners of oil wells to the use of the lines of the appellee companies. They contributed nothing to the construction of the lines, and their exclusion from their use is the exclusion resulting from the separate ownership of property as distinguished from rights of community ownership.\n There is quite a body of opinion which considers the individual ownership of property economically and politically wrong and insists upon a community of all that is profit-bearing. This opinion has its cause, among other causes, in the power-may I say the duress?-of wealth. If it accumulates 51 per cent of political power, may it put its conviction into law and justify the law by the advancement of the public welfare by destroying the monopoly and mastery of individual ownership?\n I submit, with deference, that it is misleading to say that the use of the lines by other oil owners was permitted only on terms dictated by the companies, and that through such dictation they 'became masters of the fields without owning them.' And I take it if the companies had not made purchases of oil or refused offers of oil, they would not be held subject to the act. Such is the situation of the Uncle Sam Company and the ground of decision in regard to that company. It is not held to be within the act. It seems to be minimized and considered not big enough for the application of the law, and yet it owns and operates a pipe line from the oil fields of Oklahoma to its refineries in Kansas. The extent to which it purchases oil from producers, if it does so at all, does not appear from the record. It may be supposed that if it venture to make purchases of oil it will lose its immunity. But why its exemption? Why is the fact of purchases of oil important? It is not the concern of the small oil owners to get to market? Indeed, is not that the advantage they get \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 574]\n\u00a0\n from the law, thereby being able to break away from the supposed subjection to, and 'duress' of, the superior advantages of the appellee companies? The result which the amendment under review was intended to effect as beneficial to the public welfare. The query then occurs, May all of the other oil companies give up their purchases, and, if they should, will they thereby get the freedom of the Uncle Sam Company? What, then, of the owners of oil? It may be they cannot sell their oil at all,-the local market is taken from them, a distant market is not possible for them. Is not the public welfare concerned for them in such situation? Must they remain in it dependent upon the richer owner balancing the advantages of remaining under the law or becoming free from it? Or may the power which has brought them to such situation extricate them from it by one more act of legislation in the public interest, and to take from the companies their mastery of the fields of production?\n United States ex rel Atty. Gen. v. Delaware & H. Co. \n213 U.S. 366\n, 53 L. ed. 836, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 527, opens a curious speculation and illustrates the effect of the power exercised in the legislation under review. The appellee companies, the decision is, engaging in interstate commerce, may be declared common carriers and made to carry the products of others as well as their own products. Then, having been made common carriers, under the authority of the cited case, they can be forbidden to carry their own products, and so by legal circumlocution property legally devoted to the use of its owners is forbidden such use and devoted wholly to the use of others. A queer outcome.\n I have extended this discussion beyond what I had intended. Much more, however, could be said and decisions adduced on the various elements of the case. Prophecies of the result of the principles of the decision could be made which I am afraid could not be pronounced fancilful, and projects whose shadows may even now be discerned \n\n[234 U.S. 548, 575]\n\u00a0\n will plead a justificxation by the decision in these cases. It is to be remembered that there are many jurisdictions of legislation. It is to be remembered that there cannot be one measure of control for Congress over private property and its uses and another measure of control for the states. In other words, the power which Congress has in its domain, the states have in their domain. Alarms, however, are not arguments, and I grant that legislation must be practical. But, while making this concession, and giving to the legislation in question the presumption of constitutionality to which all legislation is entitled, I am yet constrained to say that it transcends the limits of the power of regulation and takes property without due process of law.\n As I have not the power of decision, I do not enter into a discussion of the facts which distinguish the cases. It may be that the judgment of the commerce court as to the Standard Oil Company should be reversed because the lines of the company were common carriers before their acquisition, and it may be that the Prairie Oil & Gas Company was made a common carrier by the law which created it. This, however, is in controversy.\n I concur in the judgment as to the Uncle Sam Oil Company. From the judgments as to the other companies, I dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U. S. Comp.

And it shall be the duty of the district attorney of the proper district to prosecute every such suit when brought by the United States.'\n\n These sections are largely copied from the like-numbered sections of the act of March 3, 1903 (32 Stat. at L. 1213, chap. 1012), the words 'shall be unlawful' in  4 being changed to 'shall be a misdemeanor,' and the words 'shall forfeit and pay for every such offense,'  5, with what follows them, remaining as before.\n Whether cases like this are civil or criminal, and whether they are attended by the incidents of the one or the other, have been so often considered by this court that out present duty, as we shall see, is chiefly that of applying settled rules of decision.\n In Stockwell v. United States, 13 Wall. 531, 20 L. ed. 491, the question arose whether the United States could maintain a civil action of debt to recover a penalty incurred under the act of March 3, 1823 (3 Stat. at L. 781, chap. 58), providing that any person receiving, concealing, or buying merchandise, knowing that it was illegally imported and subject to seizure, should, 'on conviction thereof,' forfeit and pay double the value of the merchandise, there being also a provision that the penalty might be 'sued for and recovered,' in the name of the United States, in any court of competent jurisdiction; and this court held that the civil action was maintainable, saying (p. 542): 'But it is insisted that when the government proceeds for a penalty based on an offense against law, if must be by indictment or by information. No authority has been adduced in support of this position, and it is believed that none exists. It cannot be that whether an action of debt is maintainable or not depends upon the question who is the plaintiff. Debt lies whenever a sum certain is due to the plaintiff, or a sum which can readily be reduced to a certainty,-a sum requiring no future valuation to settle its amount. \n\n[232 U.S. 37, 42]\n\u00a0\n It is not necessarily founded upon contract. It is immaterial in what manner the obligation was incurred, or by what it is evidenced, if the sum owing is capable of being definitely ascertained.' And again (p. 543): 'The expression 'sued for and recovered' is primarily applicable to civil actions, and not to those of a criminal nature.'\n In United States v. Zucker, \n161 U.S. 475\n, 40 L. ed. 777, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 641, the government, by an action of debt, sought to recover, as a penalty, the value of imported merchandise the entry of which had been fraudulently secured in violation of  9 of the act of June 10, 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 131, chap. 407, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1886), which subjected one committing that offense to a forfeiture of the merchandise, or its value, and to a fine and imprisonment. At the trial the United States sought to read in evidence the deposition of an absent witness, theretofore taken in the cause, but the deposition was excluded upon the theory that the case, though civil in form, was in substance criminal, and therefore that the defendants were entitled, under the 6th Amendment to the Constitution, to be confronted with the witnesses against them. This resulted in a judgment for the defendants, and when the case came here this court pronounced the trial court's theory untenable, sustained the government's right to read the deposition, and reversed the judgment, saying (p. 481): 'A witness who proves facts entitling the plaintiff in a proceeding in a court of the United States, even if the plaintiff be the government, to a judgment for money only, and not to a judgment which directly involves the personal safety of the defendant, is not, within the meaning of the 6th Amendment, a witness against an 'accused' in a criminal prosecution; and his evidence may be brought before the jury in the form of a deposition, taken as prescribed by the statutes regulating the mode in which depositions to be used in the courts of the United States may be taken. The defendant, in such a case, is no more entitled to be confronted at the trial with the witnesses \n\n[232 U.S. 37, 43]\n\u00a0\n of the plaintiff than he would be in a case where the evidence related to a claim for money that could be established without disclosing any facts tending to show the commission of crime.'\n In Hepner v. United States, \n213 U.S. 103\n, 53 L. ed. 720, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 474, 16 Ann. Cas. 960, the government had brought an action of debt, under  5 of the alien immigration act of 1903, to recover the penalty prescribed for a violation of  4 of that act,-they being the sections from which those now under consideration are largely copied,-and in the progress of the cause it became necessary for this court to consider whether a verdict for the government could be directed under the rule applicable in civil actions. Upon an extended review of the cases bearing upon the subject, including Atcheson v. Everitt, Cowp. pt. 1, p. 382, the question was answered in the affirmative, and it was said:\n (p. 108) 'It must be taken as settled law that a certain sum, or a sum which can readily be reduced to a certainty, prescribed in a statute as a penalty for the violation of law, may be recovered by civil action, even if it may also be recovered in a proceeding which is technically criminal. Of course, if the statute by which the penalty was imposed contemplated recovery only by a criminal proceeding, a civil remedy could not be adopted. United States v. Claflin, \n97 U.S. 546\n, 24 L. ed. 1082. But there can be no doubt that the words of the statute on which the present suit is based are broad enough to embrace, and were intended to embrace, a civil action to recover the prescribed penalty. It provides that the penalty of one thousand dollars may be 'sued for' and recovered by the United States or by any 'person' who shall first bring his 'action' therefor 'in his own name and for his own benefit,' 'as debts of like amount are now recovered in the courts of the United States;' and 'separate suits' may be brought for each alien thus promised labor or service of any kind. The district attorney is required to prosecute every such \n\n[232 U.S. 37, 44]\n\u00a0\n 'suit' when brought by the United States. These references in the statute to the proceeding for recovering the penalty plainly indicate that a civil action is an appropriate mode of proceeding.\n ... * *\n (p. 111) 'But the decision in the Zucker Case is important in that it recognizes the right of the government, by a civil action of debt, to recover a statutory penalty, although such penalty arises from the commission of a public offense. It is important also in that it decides that an action of that kind is not of such a criminal nature as to preclude the government from establishing, according to the practice in strictly civil cases, its right to a judgment by depositions taken in the usual form, without confronting the defendant with the witnesses against him.\n ... * *\n (p. 115) 'The defendant was, of course, entitled to have a jury summoned in this case, but that right was subject to the condition, fundamental in the conduct of civil actions, that the court may withdraw a case from the jury and direct a verdict, according to the law, if the evidence is uncontradicted and raises only a question of law.'\n In Atcheson v. Everitt, approvingly cited in that case, the question for decision was whether certain testimony, admissible by statute in civil, but not in criminal, causes, could be received in an action of debt for the pecuniary penalty for bribery at an election of a member of Parliament,- an act not merely prohibited, but indictable as a crime. Notwithstanding the defendant's insistent objection, the testimony was held to be rightly receivable, it being said by Lord Mansfield, who spoke for the entire court (p. 391): 'Penal actions were never yet put under the head of criminal law, or crimes. The construction of the statute must be extended by equity to make this a criminal case. It is as much a civil action as an action for money had and received.' \n\n[232 U.S. 37, 45]\n\u00a0\n In Wilson v. Rastall, 4 T. R. 753, 758, also approvingly cited in the Hepner Case, one of the questions was whether, after a verdict for the defendant, a new trial could be granted, upon the plaintiff's motion, in an action of debt for the pecuniary penalty for bribing voters (an indictable crime). and the court gave an affirmative answer and awarded a new trial, Lord Kenyon, Ch. J., observing: 'All the cases of indictments I lay out of the case, because they are criminal cases, and are exceptions to the general rule. But I consider this as a civil action.'\n In United States v. Stevenson, \n215 U.S. 190\n, 54 L. ed. 153, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 35, which was a prosecution by indictment for a violation of  4 of the present alien immigration act, the question for decision was whether that mode of enforcing the penalty was admissible in view of the provisions of  5, permitting a civil action. It was held that an indictment would lie, and in the course of the opinion, after observing that, in the absence of some provision to the contrary, a statutory penalty may be recovered by either a criminal prosecution or a civil action of debt, it was said (p. 198): 'It is to be noted that this statute ( 5 of the immigration act) does not in terms undertake to make an action for the penalty an exclusive means of enforcing it, and only provides that it may be thus sued for and recovered. There is nothing in the terms of the act specifically undertaking to restrict the government to this method of enforcing the law. It is not to be presumed, in the absence of language clearly indicating the contrary intention, that it was the purpose of Congress to take from the government the well-recognized method of enforcing such a statute by indictment and criminal proceedings.' And then, after commenting upon the change in  4 whereby the words 'shall be unlawful' were replaced by 'shall be a misdemeanor,' and observing that the only purpose in this was to make clear the right of the government to prosecuted as for a crime, it was further said (p. 199):\n'Congress having \n\n[232 U.S. 37, 46]\n\u00a0\n declared the acts in question to constitute a misdemeanor, and having provided that an action for a penalty may be prosecuted, we think there is nothing in the terms of the statute which will cut down the right of the government to prosecute by indictment if it shall choose to resort to that method of seeking to punish an alleged offender against the statute. Nor does this conclusion take away any of the substantial rights of the citizen. He is entitled [meaning in a prosecution by indictment] to the constitutional protection which requires the government to produce the witnesses against him, and no verdict against him can be directed, as might be the case in a civil action for the penalty. Hepner v. United States, \n213 U.S. 103\n, 53 L. ed. 720, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 474, 16 Ann. Cas. 960.'\n\n The latest case in this court bearing upon the subject is Chicago, B . & Q. R. Co. v. United States, \n220 U.S. 559\n, 55 L. ed. 582, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 612, which was an action to recover penalties incurred by the violation of the safety appliance acts of Congress. In the trial court the government prevailed, and when the judgment came here for review the railway company contended that the action was in effect a criminal prosecution, and in consequence not controlled by the prior decision in St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Taylor, \n210 U.S. 281\n, 52 L. ed. 1061, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 616, 21 Am. Neg. Rep. 464,-a strictly civil case arising under the same statutes, and upon which the government relied; but it was held otherwise, the court saying (p. 578): 'This contention is unsound, because the present action is a civil one.'\n It is a necessary conclusion from these cases (1) that, as respects a pecuniary penalty for the commission of a public offense, Congress competently may authorize, and in this instance has authorized, the enforcement of such penalty by either a criminal prosecution or a civil action; (2) that the present action is a civil one and appropriate under the statute; and (3) that, if not directed otherwise, such an action is to be conducted and determined accord- \n\n[232 U.S. 37, 47]\n\u00a0\n ing to the same rules and with the same incidents as are other civil actions.\n It is of no moment in this case that the act penalized, which theretofore was declared unlawful and styled an offense, was by the statute of 1907 denominated a misdemeanor, for the purpose in that, as was explained in United States v. Stevenson, was merely to make clear the government's alternative right to prosecute as for a crime. There was no purpose to revoke the existing right to resort to a civil action, or to take from the action any of the usual incidents of a civil case. Indeed, a purpose to the contrary is shown by the re-enactment, without change, of the provision authorizing the action. It not only specifies who shall have the civil right of recovery, but also the mode of its exercise and enforcement; for it declares that the penalty 'may be sued for any recovered' by the United States, or by any person, including the alien, who shall first being the action in his own name and for his own benefit, 'as debts of like amount are now recovered in the courts of the United States.' This plainly contemplates that the proceedings in the action are to be in conformity with the recognized mode of adjudicating and enforcing debts of like amount in those courts, and this whether the action be by the government or by an individual.\n While the defendant was entitled to have the issues tried before a jury, this right did not arise from article 3 of the Constitution or from the 6th Amendment, for both relate to prosecutions which are strictly criminal in their nature (Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 \nU.S. 547, 563\n, 35 S. L. ed. 1110, 1114, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 816, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 195; United States v. Zucker, \n161 \nU.S. 475, 481\n, 40 S. L. ed. 777, 779, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 641; Callan v. Wilson, \n127 \nU.S. 540, 549\n, 32 S. L. ed. 223, 226, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1301), but it did arise out of the fact that in a civil action of debt involving more than $20 a jury trial is demandable. And while in a strictly criminal prosecution the jury may not return a verdict against the defendant unless the evidence estab- \n\n[232 U.S. 37, 48]\n\u00a0\n lishes his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, in civil actions it is the duty of the jury to resolve the issues of fact according to a reasonable preponderance of the evidence, and this although they may involve a penalized or criminal act.\n So, in providing that the penalty may be sued for and recovered as debts of like amount are recovered, we think it was intended that a reasonable preponderance of the proof should be sufficient, that being one of the recognized incidents of an action of debt as well as of other civil actions.\n This is the view which other Federal courts have generally applied in the administration of statutes authorizing a civil recovery of such penalties. United States v. Brown, Deady, 566, Fed. Cas. No. 14,662; 3880 Boxes of Opium v. United States, 23 Fed. 367; Hawlowetz v. Kass, 23 Blatchf. 395, 25 Fed. 765; The Good Templar, 97 Fed. 651; United States v. Southern P. Co. 162 Fed. 412; New York C. & H. R. R. Co. v. United States, 91 C. C. A. 519, 165 Fed. 833; United States v. Illinois C. R. Co. 95 C. C. A. 628, 170 Fed. 542; Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. United States, 101 C. C. A. 140, 178 Fed. 12; St. Louis Southwestern R. Co. v. United States, 106 C. C. A. 136, 183 Fed. 770. And such, also, is the prevalent course of decision in the state courts. 4 Wigmore, Ev.  2498; People v. Briggs, 114 N. Y. 56, 20 N. E. 820; State v. Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co. 122 Iowa, 22, 101 Am. St. Rep. 254, 96 N. W. 904; Hitchcock v. Munger, 15 N. H. 97; Sparta v. Lewis, 91 Tenn. 370, 23 S. W. 182; O'Connell v. O'Leary, 145 Mass. 311, 312, 14 N. E. 143; Munson v. Atwood, 30 Conn. 102; State ex rel. Essex v. Kansas City, Ft. S. & M. R. Co. 70 Mo. App. 634; Deveaux v. Clemens, 17 Ohio C. C. 33, 6 Ohio C. D. 647; Semon v. People, 42 Mich. 141, 3 N. W. 304; Walker v. State, 6 Blackf. 1; Roberge v. Burnham, 124 Mass. 277. In the last case the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, in applying this measure of persuasion in an action for a penalty, said: \n\n[232 U.S. 37, 49]\n\u00a0\n 'The rule of evidence requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt is generally applicable only in strictly criminal proceedings. It is founded upon the reason that a greater degree of probability should be required as a ground of judgment in criminal cases, which affect life or liberty, than may safely be adopted in cases where civil rights only are ascertained. 2 Russell, Crimes, 7th Am. ed. 727. It often happens that civil suits involve the proof of acts which expose the party to a criminal prosecution. Such are proceedings under the statute for the maintenance of bastard children, proceedings to obtain a divorce for adultery, actions for assaults, actions for criminal conversation or for seduction, and others which might be named. And in such actions, which are brought for the determination of civil rights, the general rule applicable to civil suits prevails, that proof by a reasonable preponderance of the evidence is sufficient.'\n The cases upon which the defendant relies do not compel or lead to a different conclusion. While in United States v. The Burdett, 9 Pet. 682, 9 L. ed. 273, language was used giving color to the contention that in an action such as this the true measure of persuasion is that applied in criminal prosecutions, the court was careful in Lilienthal v. United States, \n97 U.S. 237\n, 24 L. ed. 901, to point out (pp. 266, 267) the distinction in this regard between criminal prosecutions and civil cases, and to show (p. 272) that the case of The Burdett is not an authority for disregarding the distinction, and that in an action to enforce a forfeiture the jury, if satisfied of the truth of the charge upon which the forfeiture depends, 'may render a verdict for the government, even though the proof falls short of what is required in a criminal case prosecuted by indictment.' In Chaffee v. United States, 18 Wall. 516, 21 L. ed. 908, the trial court, probably in deference to what was said in the case of The Burdett, had instructed the jury that proof beyond a reasonable doubt was essential to a recovery; but, as the gov- \n\n[232 U.S. 37, 50]\n\u00a0\n ernment had a verdict and judgment, and was not in a position to assign error upon the instruction, the case hardly can be regarded as settling the propriety of such an instruction, especially as in Coffey v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 436, 443\n, 29 S. L. ed. 684, 686, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 437, thirteen years later, it was plainly assumed that in such actions the true measure of persuasion is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but the preponderating weight of the evidence. The cases of Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 29 L. ed. 746, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 524, and Lees v. United States, \n150 U.S. 476\n, 37 L. ed. 1150, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 163, are without present application, for they deal with the guaranty in the 5th Amendment to the Constitution against compulsory self-incrimination, which, as this court has held, embraces proceedings to enforce penalties and forfeitures as well as criminal prosecutions, and is of broader scope than are the guaranties in article 3 and the 6th Amendment govrning trials in criminal prosecutions. Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 \nU.S. 547, 563\n, 35 S. L. ed. 1110, 1114, 3 Inters. Com. Rep. 816, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 195; United States v. Zucker, \n161 \nU.S. 475, 481\n, 40 S. L. ed. 777, 779, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 641; Hepner v. United States, \n213 \nU.S. 103, 112\n, 53 S. L. ed. 720, 724, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 474, 16 Ann. Cas. 960. See also Callan v. Wilson, \n127 \nU.S. 540, 549\n, 32 S. L. ed. 223, 226, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1301; Schick v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 65, 68\n, 49 S. L. ed. 99, 101, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 826, 1 Ann. Cas. 585.\n We conclude that it was error to apply to this case the standard of persuasion applicable to criminal prosecutions; and the judgment is accordingly reversed, with a direction for a new trial.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","250":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. SALEN(1914)\nNo. 506\nArgued: October 23, 1914Decided: November 30, 1914\n\n\n\n Salen was indicted for making false statements in the sworn declaration required if consignees by the Tariff act of 1909. (36 Stat. at L. 93, chap. 6, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 899.) The first five counts charged that, in entering laces in February, \n\n[235 U.S. 237, 238]\n\u00a0\n 1910, and January and February, 1913, he had falsely sworn that the consular invoices attached were the only invoices covering the shipments, when he well knew that there were others in existence. The court overruled the demurrer to these counts and they are not involved in this case.\n The sixth count related to a declaration made by Salen on March 17, 1913, in making an entry of foreign laces covered by consular invoice No. 7893. Salen was therein charged with having fraudulently concealed from the collector the existence of certain material facts, and thereby had falsified the required statement in the sworn declaration 'that nothing has been on my part, nor, to my knowledge, on the part of any other person, concealed or suppressed, whereby the United States may be defrauded of any part of the duty due on said goods.' This count sets out at great length and in narrative form certain evidentiary facts which may be thus summarized:\n Salen was the New York agent and primary consignee of Goetz, a French exporter, who, for eight years, had been shipping laces to Salen for sale and delivery to Robinson, the purchaser and ultimate consignee.\n When the last consignment arrived in New York, Salen presented the declaration to the collector, attaching thereto, as required by law, the bill of lading; a list or entry account of the goods; and the consular invoice No. 7893. He paid the duty assessed on the basis of the foreign values as given in the invoice, and thereupon removed the goods and delivered them to Robinson, the purchaser. This count of the indictment further charged that Salen knew that the foreign values had been falsely and fraudulently stated in the previous invoices; that such foreign values named in those invoices were uniformly greatly below the prices at which the laces were sold in the United States; that, in making the declaration as to the shipment represented by consular invoice No. 7893, \n\n[235 U.S. 237, 239]\n\u00a0\n Salen concealed the fact that it was one of the series of shipments in which Goetz and Robinson had fraudulently concealed the great and uniform discrepancy between the foreign values named in the invoices and the prices at which the lace was sold in the United States.\n It was charged that this concealment was the suppression of a fact by which the United States may have been defrauded of its lawful duty, for if Salen had communicated the facts, the collector would have called for a reappraisement of the laces, and their undervaluation would have been disclosed.\n The defendant demurred on the ground that there was no positive averment that the goods were undervalued, but only an argumentative statement of facts the existence of which did not raise the legal conclusion that there was any undervaluation, and that the count failed to charge facts sufficient to constitute an offense under subsection 6 of  28 of the act of August 5, 1909, or any other statute of the United States. The demurrer was sustained on the ground that the facts stated did not constitute an offense under the statute, and the case was then brought here by the government under the criminal appeals act.\n Assistant Attorney General Warren for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[235 U.S. 237, 242]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Marion Erwin and Frederick M. Czaki for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Lamar:\n\n\n[235 U.S. 237, 244]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n This writ of error raises the question as to whether the suppression clause in the declaration required to be made by agent consignees of imported goods (36 Stat. at L. 95, chap. 6, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 902) relates to the omission of matter proper to be included in the invoice and account attached, or to independent facts which, if brought to the attention of the collector, \n\n[235 U.S. 237, 245]\n\u00a0\n would have excited his suspicion and induced him to institute a special inquiry as to the value of the merchandise mentioned in the account and invoice.\n No case directly in point has been cited; but counsel have traced the history of the clause from the act of 1799, which required only one form of declaration from all importers, through the subsequent statutes, which, like the tariff act of 1909, provide for slightly different forms, according as the entry is made by owner, manufacturer, consignee, or agent . (1 Stat. at L. 656, chap, 22; 3 Stat. at L. 730, chap. 21; 22 Stat. at L. 524, chap. 121; 26 Stat. at L. 132, chap. 407, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1890; 36 Stat. at L. 93, chap. 6, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 899.) Under the act of 1799 every importer had to attach the consular invoice and entry account and swear that he 'had not in the said entry or invoice concealed or suppressed anything' whereby the government might be defrauded of its duty. This clause is still retained in the form required to be signed by owner and manufacturer. Where the goods are entered by an agent consignee he makes declaration that 'nothing has been on my part, nor, to my knowledge, on the part of any other person, concealed or suppressed, whereby the United States may be defrauded of any part of the duty lawfully due on the said goods, wares, and merchandise.' Much of the argument was addressed to the effect of this difference in the language in the respective forms of the several declarations. 36 Stat. at L. 93-95, chap 6; U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, pp. 899-902.\n Counsel for Salen insist that this difference is due to the fact that the suppression clause in the consignee's declaration was included in a sentence all the terms of which related to invoice and entry. The declaration to be signed by owner and manufacturer (36 Stat. at L. 94, 95, chap. 6, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, pp. 900, 902) was in two sentences, and as the last of the two contained the suppression clause, it was necessary, from a grammatical point of view, to mention invoice and account as antecedents. It is argued that the owner's statement conveyed the same meaning as was otherwise expressed in \n\n[235 U.S. 237, 246]\n\u00a0\n the suppression clause of the consignee's declaration. On the other hand, the government contends that the difference in phraseology indicated an intent to require the consignee to disclose matters as to which no requirement was made where the goods were entered by owner or manufacturer.\n Congress, of course, could have legislated in the same statute so as to make a distinction between consignor and consignee. But no satisfactory reason is given why Congress should have imposed no penalty upon an owner for concealing a great and uniform difference between invoice values and selling prices, while at the same time making the agent guilty of a felony for suppressing exactly the same fact. The moral quality of the act was the same whether the concealment was by owner or agent; the result to the government was the same, and all doubtful or ambiguous language in a statute covering the same subject should be construed on the natural supposition that Congress required identity of disclosures and provided identity of punishment for identity of concealment.\n In arriving at the meaning of the clause on which this indictment is founded it may be helpful to consider the purpose of the statute, in the light of the customs regulations applicable to the entry of foreign merchandise at a domestic port.\n Foreign value is the basis on which ad valorem duties are imposed (36 Stat. at L. 101, subsec. 18, chap. 6, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 914 ), and Congress has made various provisions to enable collectors and appraisers to obtain information as to such foreign values. To that end it authorizes them to examine all importers or consignees under oath, so as to secure from them a statement of any facts which might shed light on the amount of duty to be paid. Any false statement made on such examination subjects them to indictment and punishment as for a felony (26 Stat. at L. 139,  16, 17, chap. 407). \n\n[235 U.S. 237, 247]\n\u00a0\n But the documents attached to the declaration are the primary source of information as to value. They consist of a consular invoice [prepared by the consignor, showing a list of the goods and their foreign value at the date of exportation]; an entry or account [prepared by the consignee, showing marks, numbers, contents, quantity, invoice value, dutiable value, and the rate of duty of the goods. Customs Regulations 217]; and also the bill of landing [prepared by the master of the vessel]. If these three papers, prepared by three different persons, have been truly and correctly made, they contain all the information needed to assess the duties. In view, therefore, of the importance of these documents, the statute makes specific provisions by which they are to be verified, and, as will appear from an analysis of the declaration (36 Stat. at L. 93, chap. 6, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 899), the consignee states in the first sentence1 of the declaration: \n\n[235 U.S. 237, 248]\n\u00a0\n (1) That he is the consignee of the merchandise described in the annexedentry and invoice;\n'(2) that the invoice and bill of lading are the true and only invoice and bill of lading;\n\n'(3) that they are in the state in which they were actually received by him;\n\n'(4) that he does not know or believe in the existence of any other invoice or bill of lading;\n\n'(5) that the entry delivered to the collector contains a just and true account of the merchandise according to the invoices;\n\n'(6) that nothing has been suppressed by him, or, to his knowledge, on the part of any other person, whereby the United States may be defrauded of any part of the duty lawfully due on the merchandise;\n\n'(7) that the said invoice and the declaration therein are in all respects true, and were made by the person by whom they purport to have been made;\n\n'(8) that if at any time he discovers any error in the \n\n[235 U.S. 237, 249]\n\u00a0\n said invoice or in the account now rendered, he will immediately make the same known to the collector, . . .'\n\n It will be seen that the declaration was not only intended to secure an affirmative statement as to the genuineness of the documents and of the correctness of what was actually therein set out, but the consignee was also required to make a negative averment that nothing had been suppressed or concealed by himself or, so far as he knew, by anyone else,-that is, nothing had been suppressed or concealed in the account [prepared by the consignee]; in the consular invoice [prepared by the exporter]; or in the bill of lading [prepared by the master of the vessel]. Seven of the eight clauses distinctly related to documents. To say that the sixth clause in this enumeration was intended to embrace undefined extraneous matter would be to suddenly depart from the particular to the general, and back again from the general to the particular; -from the particular subject of documents, to which the attention of the affiant had been specially directed by the first five clauses, into a general field of wide and indefinite scope; and-in the seventh clause-again to return to the particular subject of documents. Such an interpretation would give an exceedingly liberal construction to a statute defining a felony. It would ignore the fact that the meaning of words is affected by their context, and violate the settled rule that words which, standing alone, might have a wide and comprehensive import, will, when joined with those defining specific acts, be interpreted in their narrower sense, and understood to refer to things of the same nature as those described in the associated list, enumeration, or class. Cf. Virginia v. Tennessee, \n148 U.S. 519\n, 37 L. ed. 543, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 728; United States v. Chase, \n135 U.S. 258\n, 34 L. ed. 118, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 756, 8 Am. Crim. Rep. 649; Neal v. Clark ( Neal v. Scruggs) \n95 U.S. 708\n, 24 L. ed. 587.\n The fact that, under this rule, the general language of the suppression clause is to be restricted to the documents to which all the other clauses in the sentence refer, \n\n[235 U.S. 237, 250]\n\u00a0\n does not, of course, mean that Congress has deprived the collector of the means of obtaining information as to extraneous facts that might assist him in passing upon questions of value, or in determining whether there had been any violation of the tariff law.\n But the method by which that information is to be obtained is the examination of the owner, consignee, or agent under oath. 26 Stat. at L. 139, chap. 407; 36 Stat. at L. 100, subsecs. 15, 16, chap. 6, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, pp. 919, 920; Customs Regulations, 1908,  865. The very fact that provision is made for such examination is itself a clear indication that there may be material matter, not proper for inclusion in the declaration, but which might still be important in the assessment of the duty. But to say that in signing the statutory form of declaration consignee should in effect answer specific questions and at the same time be required, on peril of committing a felony, to disclose extraneous evidentiary facts as to which no direct question was asked, and to which his attention was not directed, is to make the declaration serve a purpose for which it was not intended, and spread a net that might catch the unwary as well as the fraudulent consignee. United States v. Reese, \n92 U.S. 221\n, 23 L. ed. 565. For, under the contention of the plaintiff in error, it is not necessary that Salen should have intended to defraud, or that the government should have been actually defrauded. The crime was committed if the United States 'may have been defrauded.' So that even if the foreign value on which the duty was assessed had been truly stated in the declaration, the consignee would yet be guilty of a felony if he failed to call attention to facts which would have excited the collector's suspicion and induced him to demand a reappraisement. Such an interpretation of the statute is not only contrary to the rule which restricts the operation of the suppression clause to the particular matters enumerated in all other parts of the printed declaration, but would fix no standard by which to draw \n\n[235 U.S. 237, 251]\n\u00a0\n the line between innocent silence and felonious concealment.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Declaration of Consignee, Importer, or Agent, where Merchandise Has Been Actually Purchased.\n I, _____ _____, do solemnly and truly declare that I am the consignee, importer, or agent of the merchandise described in the annexed entry and invoice; that the invoice and bill of lading now presented by me to the collector of $05R are the true and only invoice and bill of lading by me received of all the goods, wares, and merchandise imported in the _____, whereof _____ is master, from _____, for account of any person whomsoever for whom I am authorized to enter the same; that the said invoice and bill of lading are in the state in which they were actually received by me, and that I do not know or believe in the existence of any other invoice or bill of lading of the said goods, wares, and merchandise; that the entry now delivered to the collector contains a just and true account of the said goods, wares, and merchandise, according to the said invoice and bill of lading; that nothing has been on my part, nor, to my knowledge, on the part of any other person, concealed or suppressed, whereby the United States may be defrauded of any part of the duty lawfully due on the said goods, wares, and merchandise; that the said invoice and the declaration therein are in all respects true, and were made by the person by whom the same purport to have been made; and that if at any time hereafter I discover any error in the said invoice, or in the account now rendered of the said goods, wares, and merchandise, or receive any other invoice of the same, I will immediately make the same known to the collector of this district.

After full hearing the Commission entered an order granting in certain respects the relief prayed, but establishing a proportionate relation to be maintained between the lower rate for the longer haul and the higher rate for the shorter haul upon the basis of percentages which were fixed with reference to defined zones. The carriers refused to obey the order, and filed their bill in the commerce court to enjoin its enforcement. An interlocutory injunction was ordered. The defendants moved to dismiss, and, on the overruling of the motions, appealed from the interlocutory order, that case being No. 137.

VULTE(1914)\nNo. 256\nArgued: March 10, 1914Decided: May 4, 1914\n\n\n\n Assistant Attorney General Thompson for appellant.\n\n\n[233 U.S. 509, 511]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George A. King and William B. King for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n The appellee, Nelson P. Vulte, filed a petition in the court of claims claiming to be entitled to $299.78, being 10 per cent of his regular pay for service beyond the seas. Judgment was entered in his favor for that amount, and the United States prosecuted this appeal.\n The court found the following facts: Vulte was appointed second lieutenant in the Marine Corps June 30, 1893, and was promoted to first lieutenant March 3, 1904. Under orders assigning him for duty in Porto Rico with station at San Juan, he sailed from New York for Porto Rico June 27, 1908, and served there until November 3, 1909, when he was detached and ordered back to the United States. He was four days on the return voyage.\n If it is held that he is entitled to 10 per cent for services in Porto Rico from the date of sailing from New York until the date of his detachment from duty at San Juan, there would accrue to him the sum of $ 296.72, and \n\n[233 U.S. 509, 512]\n\u00a0\n an additional sum of $3.06 if entitled to pay en route from Porto Rico to New York.\n Vulte's pay was originally fixed by  1612 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1096) as follows: 'The officers of the Marine Corps shall be entitled to receive the same pay and allowances, and the enlisted men shall be entitled to receive the same pay and bounty for re- enlisting, as are or may be provided by or in pursuance of law for the officers and enlisted men of like grades in the Infantry of the Army.'\n On June 30, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 512, chap. 1328, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 339), as part of the appropriation act for the Army, Congress modified existing law respecting the pay proper of officers of this grade by the following language: 'For additional ten per centum increase on pay of commissioned officers serving at foreign stations, four hundred and fifty-one thousand, four hundred and fifty-six dollars: Provided, That hereafter the pay proper of all commissioned officers and enlisted men serving beyond the limits of the states comprising the Union and the territories of the United States contiguous thereto shall be increased ten per centum for officers and twenty per centum for enlisted men over and above the rates of pay proper as flxed by law for time of peace, and the time of such service shall be counted from the date of departure from said states to the date of return thereto.'\n As observed by Mr. Justice Booth, delivering the opinion of the court of claims: 'Thus far the rights of plaintiff [Vulte] respecting pay are obvious; the complications arise by subsequent legislation.'\n On June 12, 1906, Congress provided-'for additional ten per centum increase on pay of commissioned officers serving beyond the limits of the states comprising the Union and the territories of the United States contiguous thereto (except Porto Rico and Hawaii), as provided by act of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and two, the time of such service to be counted from the date of departure \n\n[233 U.S. 509, 513]\n\u00a0\n from said states to the date of return thereto. . . .' (34 Stat. at L. 247, chap. 3078.)\n This provision of the act of June 12, 1906, was repeated in the appropriation act of 1907. 34 Stat. at L. 1164, chap. 2511.\n The act of May 11, 1908, provided as follows: 'That increase of pay for service beyond the limits of the states comprising the Union and the territories of the United States contiguous thereto shall be as now provided by law.\n ... * *\n'For additional ten per centum increase on pay of officers on foreign service, two hundred and eighty-five thousand dollars.\n\n ... * *\n'That nothing herein contained shall be construed so as to reduce the pay or allowances now authorized by law for any officer or enlisted man of the Army; and all laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the provisions of this act are hereby repealed.' 35 Stat. at L. 110, 114, chap. 163, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, pp. 341, 354.\n\n The short point in the case is to what the words 'shall be as now provided by law' in the act of May 11, 1908, refer,-whether to the acts of 1906 and 1907, or more limitedly, we may say, to the exceptions of Porto Rico and Hawaii in those acts, or to the proviso in the act of June 30, 1902, supra. In other words, whether the exceptions of those years of those special places shall prevail over the substantive provision of the act of June 30, 1902, supra, which is explicit, of enduring effect, and is besides comprehensive of all foreign stations, its language being: 'That hereafter the pay proper of all commissioned officers . . . serving beyond the limits of the states . . . shall be increased ten per centum. . . .'\n The government contends for the exceptions as constituting new law, not as a temporary condition under an \n\n[233 U.S. 509, 514]\n\u00a0\n old one. The claimant contends for the proviso of the act of 1902, and counsel, in quite elaborate arguments, have supported their respective contentions. We shall not follow the details of their arguments. The question presented, we think, is in brief compass. Congress manifestly did not think that by the first instance of the exception, that in the act of 1906, it had done more than temporarily suspend as to Porto Rico and Hawaii the act of June 30, 1902. The exception was repeated in 1907. If the first exception was not intended to affect permanently the act of 1902, why should such intention be ascribed to the second exception-or to both, neither having words of prospective extension, and, without such words, naturally having only temporary operation? It would be extreme to say that by making them Congress considered that it had established a policy which could be confidently referred to as having the status and effect of permanent law.\n The exceptions it is to be remembered, were in appropriation acts, and no words were used to indicate any other purpose than the disbursement of a sum of money for the particular fiscal years. This court has had occasion to deal with such instances of legislation and their intended effect on existing law. In United States v. Langston, \n118 \nU.S. 389, 394\n, 30 S. L. ed. 164, 165, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1185, it was decided that a statute which fixed the annual salary of a public officer at a designated sum without limitation as to time is not abrogated or suspended by subsequent enactments which merely appropriate a less amount for that officer for particular years, and which contained no words that expressly or by clear implication modified or repealed the previous law. See also Minis v. United States, 15 Pet. 423, 445, 10 L. ed. 791, 799, where it is said: 'It would be somewhat unusual to find engrafted upon an act making special and temporary appropriation any provision which was to have a general and permanent applications to all future appropriations. \n\n[233 U.S. 509, 515]\n\u00a0\n Nor ought such an intention on the part of the legislature to be presumed, unless it is expressed in the most clear and positive terms, and where the language admits of no other reasonable interpretation.' This follows naturally from the nature of appropriation bills, and the presumption hencearising is fortified by the rules of the Senate and House of Representatives.\n The ruling in the Langston and Minis Cases is not opposed by the cases cited by the government. In all of them there was something more than the mere omission to appropriate a sufficient sum. There were expressions indicating a broader purpose. In two of them, United States v. Fisher, \n109 U.S. 143\n, 27 L. ed. 885, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 154, and United States v. Mitchell, \n109 U.S. 146\n, 27 L. ed. 887, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 157 it was intimated that the law was only suspended for the particular years. In another, Wallace v. United States, \n133 U.S. 180\n, 33 L. ed. 571, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 251, it was held that the appropriation constituted the law which prescribed the compensation of the office. And in all of them the Langston Case was referred to and not disturbed or modified.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","253":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. WIGGER(1914)\nNo. 349\nArgued: October 23, 1914Decided: November 30, 1914\n\n\n\n Assistant Attorney General Warren for plaintiff in error.\n No appearance for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n The grand jury returned an indictment against defendant in error containing three counts, charging him with as many different violations of the criminal laws in force \n\n[235 U.S. 276, 277]\n\u00a0\n in Alaska. He demurred upon the ground (among others) that more than one crime was charged. The demurrer was sustained by the district court upon this ground, and the case comes here under the criminal appeals act of March 2, 1907. (34 Stat. at L. 1246, chap. 2564. ) The other grounds of the demurrer need not be further noticed.\n By  43 of title II. of the act of Congress approved March 3, 1899 ( Alaska Code of Criminal Procedure, 30 Stat. at L. 1253, 1290, chap. 429; Comp. Laws of Alaska  2152), it was declared that 'the indictment must charge but one crime, and in one form only; except that where the crime may be committed by use of different means the indictment may allege the means in the alternative.' And by  90 of the same Code (30 Stat. at L. 1294, chap. 429; Comp. Laws of Alaska,  2199), the defendant was entitled to demur where more than one crime was charged. But by an act of the legislature of Alaska, approved April 26, 1913 (Sess. Laws, p. 65), it was enacted that  43 of title II of the act just mentioned should be amended to read (like  1024, Rev. Stat. U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 720) as follows:\n'When there are several charges against any person for the same act or transaction, or for two or more acts or transactions connected together, or for two or more acts or transactions of the same class of crimes or offenses, which may be properly joined, instead of having several indictments the whole may be joined in one indictment in separate counts; and if two or more indictments are found in such cases, the court may order them to be consolidated.'\n\n The sole question presented for decision is whether this act of the territorial legislature was efficacious to amend the act of Congress. In Summers v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 92, 105\n, 58 S. L. ed. 137, 141, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 38, the validity of the territorial act was assumed; but no question had been raised about it.\n Local powers of legislation were first conferred upon Alaska by act of Congress of August 24, 1912 (37\n Comp. St. 1913,  1704. \n\n[235 U.S. 276, 278]\n\u00a0\n Stat. at L. 512, chap. 387), of which the most pertinent clauses are set forth in the margin. \n1\n The scope of the authority of the \n\n[235 U.S. 276, 279]\n\u00a0\n territorial legislature, so far as the present question is concerned, depends especially upon the true intent and meaning of the clause contained in  3, 'that all the laws of the United States heretofore passed, establishing the executive and judicial departments in Alaska, shall continue in full force and effect until amended or repealed by act of Congress.'\n In order to determine what laws were by this language preserved from interference at the hands of the local legislature a brief review is necessary.\n The territory in question having been ceded to the United States by the Emperor of Russia by treaty of March 30, 1867 (15 Stat. at L. 539), Congress in the following year extended to it certain of the laws of the United States, at the same time enacting that, until otherwise provided, violations of the act should be prosecuted in any district court of the United States in California or Oregon or in the district courts of Washington (act of July 27, 1868, 15 Stat. at L. 240, 241, chap. 273,  7).* By act of May 17, 1884, entitled, 'An Act Providing a Civil Government for Alaska' (23 Stat. at L. 24, chap. 53), the territory was declared to constitute a civil and judicial district; the appointment of a governor with executive authority was provided for, and by the 3d section it was enacted: 'There shall be, and hereby is, established a district court for said district, with the civil and criminal jurisdiction of district courts of the United States, and the civil and criminal jurisdiction of district courts of the United States exercising the jurisdiction of circuit courts, and such other jurisdiction, not inconsistent with this act, as may be established by law.' Provision was made for the appointment of a district judge and four commissioners, whose\n * Comp. St. 1913,  8851. \n\n[235 U.S. 276, 280]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction and powers were prescribed, and for appellate review.\n But the act of March 3, 1899, already mentioned (30 Stat. at L. 1253, chap. 429), Congress provided an elaborate Criminal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure, of which title I. contains 219 sections, defining crimes and offenses, and providing for their punishment, and title II. contains 481 sections, dealing for the most part with proceedings for the punishment and prevention of the crimes defined in title I. By act of June 6, 1900, entitled, 'An Act Making Further Provision for a Civil Government for Alaska, and for Other Purposes' (31 Stat. at L. 321, chap. 786), further provision was made, under title I., for the establishment of the executive and judicial departments in the territory. \n2\n Title II. contains 1, 048 sections, constituting a Code of Civil Procedure (31 Stat. at L. 333- 494, chap. 786; Comp. Laws of Alaska,  378-638). Title III. contains 368 sections, and is called the Civil Code (31 Stat. at L. 494-552, chap. 786; Comp. Laws of Alaska,  277-362). In the Code of Civil Procedure, a chapter (31 Stat. at L. 442, chap. 786,  698 et seq.) is devoted to the courts of justice, and contains sections prescribing their jurisdiction, powers, and authority. By an act approved March 3, 1909 (35 Stat. at L. 839, chap. 209,  2), the act of 1900 was amended with respect to the jurisdiction of the district court.\n As already remarked, legislative power was first conferred upon the territory by the act of August 24, 1912 (37 Stat. at L. 512, chap. 387). From the provision of this act, \n\n[235 U.S. 276, 281]\n\u00a0\n 'That all the laws of the United States heretofore passed, establishing the executive and judicial departments in Alaska, shall continue in full force and effect until amended or repealed by act of Congress,' the district court, after a review of the other legislation to which attention has been called, drew the conclusion that the laws concerning procedure in actions prosecuted in the name of the United States and by its officers are an essential and integral part of the laws establishing the executive and judicial departments, and that therefore these can be amended or repealed only by act of Congress.\n With this view we are unable to concur. It seems to us that by the language employed, Congress intended to draw a clear distinction between those laws by which the executive and judicial departments had been established in the territory and those minor regulations that had to do with practice and procedure. Those enactments by which Congress had provided for the appointment of executive and judicial officers for the territory, and had marked out the powers, authority, and jurisdiction of each, and provided safeguards for their maintenance, are properly within the category of laws 'establishing' those departments.

S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1354).\n The libel alleges that the drugs are in the possession and custody of the Wholesale Drug Exchange, a body corporate, at a numbered place in the city of Washington.\n The drugs, it is alleged, are intended to be used for the cure and mitigation and prevention of diseases of man. They are described as follows: \n\n[231 U.S. 654, 660]\n\u00a0\n 'Twenty packages, more or less, of said drug, labeled and branded as follows, 'Antikamnia Tablets, contain 305 grains of acetphenetidin, U.

One ounce Antikamnia and Quinine Tablets. Manufactured in the United States of America by the Antikamnia Chemical Co., St. Louis, U. S. A.\"\n\n The ground of confiscation and condemnation alleged is that all of the packages of the drugs contain a large quantity and proportion of acetphenetidin, which, it is alleged, is a derivative of acetanilid, and that under the provisions of the act of Congress and of the regulations lawfully made thereunder it is provided and required that the label on each of the packages shall bear a statement that the acetphenetidin contained therein is a derivative of acetanilid; and yet it is alleged that each and all of the packages fail to comply with such provisions.\n It is also alleged that the packages are further misbranded, in that the labels thereon are false and misleading, for the reason that each and all of them bear the statement that no acetanilid is contained therein, and that the statement imports and signifies that there is no quantity of any derivative of acetanilid contained in the drug.\n A warrant of arrest was issued upon which the marshal duly made return that he had arrested twenty packages of Antikamnia tablets, ten packages of Antikamnia quinine tablets, and sixty-three packages labeled 'Antikamnia and Codein Tablets,' and otherwise duly executed the warrant.\n The Antikamnia Chemical Company, appellee and defendant in error, alleging itself to be the owner of the drugs, petitioned to be made a defendant in the libel. The petition was granted, and the company thereupon filed the exceptions to the libel. The exceptions negative in detail the charges of the libel, and assert conformity in the labeling of the packages to the act of Congress of June 30, 1906, quoting its 8th section as follows: '. . . or if the package fail to bear a statement on the label of the quantity or proportion of \n\n[231 U.S. 654, 662]\n\u00a0\n any alcohol, morphin, opium, cocaine, heroin, alpha or beta eucaine, chloroform cannabis indica, chloral hydrate, or acetanilid, or any derivative or preparation of any such substances contained therein.' And it is averred that the act does not provide that there should be added to any derivative of any of the substances contained therein the name of the parent substance, and the act cannot be added to or enlarged by requiring the company to add to the name of a known article, the fact that the article is a derivative of any of the substances mentioned in the act. It is averred, therefore, that the packages are not misbranded, and that the statement on the labels that no acetanilid is contained therein is in no way false or misleading, because the libel does not allege that there is acetanilid in the packages, and, therefore, the statement, instead of being false and misleading, is, according to the allegations of the libel, true.\n The exceptions were sustained and the libel dismissed.\n It was stipulated that Food Inspection Decision No. 112, issued January 27, 1910 by the United States Department of Agriculture, was considered by the court upon the hearing of the cause, and should be included in and be considered part of the record on appeal.\n The decision quotes  8 of the act, states that the Attorney General, in an opinion rendered January 15, 1909, held that a derivative is a substance so related to one of the specified substances 'that it would be rightly regarded by recognized authorities in chemistry as obtained from the latter 'by actual or theoretical substitution,' and it is not indispensable that it should be actually produced therefrom as a matter of fact;' further, that the labeling of derivatives, as prescribed by  8, is a proper subject conferred upon the Department by  3, and that a rule or regulation requiring the name of the specified substance to follow that of the derivative would be in harmony with the general purpose of the act, and an \n\n[231 U.S. 654, 663]\n\u00a0\n appropriate method by which to give effect to its provisions.\n In conformity to this opinion, Regulation 28 of the Rules and Regulations for the Enforcement of the Food and Drugs Act was amended as follows: '. . . Acetanilide (antifebrine, phenylacetamide). Derivatives- Acetphenetidine, . . . (g) In declaring the quantity or proportion of any of the specified substances the names by which they are designated in the act shall be used, and in declaring the quantity or proportion of the derivatives of any of the specified substances, in addition to the tradename of the derivative, the name of the specified substance shall also be stated, so as to indicate clearly that the product is a derivative of the particular specified substance.'\n The decree of the supreme court of the District, dismissing the libel, was affirmed by the court of appeals.\n The case is not in very broad compass, though the arguments of counsel are somewhat elaborate. The libel is prosecuted for the condemnation of one hundred packages of Antikamnia tablets as being misbranded in violation of the food and drugs act of June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 768, chap. 3915, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1354). The tablets contain acetphenetidin and the labels so state, and the proportion of the substance. It is a derivative of acetanilid, but the labels do not so state, but do state that the tablets contain no acetanilid. And these omissions, it is contended by the government, constitute a violation of the statute and of Regulation No. 28, as amended. The chemical company contends that the first statement is not required by the law, and that the second statement is true, and therefore cannot be false or misleading.\n Preceding the discussion of these contentions a question of jurisdiction is presented by the chemical company, and a motion to dismiss is made on the ground that only the construction of the statute is involved in the decision of \n\n[231 U.S. 654, 664]\n\u00a0\n the court below. The company also moves for an affirmance of the judgment on the ground that the appeal is frivolous. Contra, the government contends that the court of appeals held invalid the regulations requiring the name of the primary substance as well as that of the derivative to be stated on the label; and that there is not only drawn in question, but so far denied, an authority exercised under the United States. We concur in this view. The validity of the regulation was and is denied. Its validity may, indeed, rest on the statute, but so did the validity of the rule of the Patent Office passed on in United States ex rel. Steinmetz v. Allen, \n192 U.S. 543\n, 48 L. ed. 555, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 416. We there said of a rule of practice established by the Commissioner of Patents under a section of the Revised Statutes: 'It thereby became a rule of procedure and constituted, in part, the powers of the primary examiner and commissioner. In other words, it became an authority of those officers, and, necessarily, an authority 'under the United States.' Its validity was and is assailed by the plaintiff in error. We think, therefore, we have jurisdiction, and the motion to dismiss is denied.' United States ex rel. Taylor v. Taft, \n203 U.S. 461\n, 51 L. ed. 269, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 148, is not in antagonism to this ruling. In that case the relator was dismissed from the public service by an order of the Secretary of War as representative of the President. She sought restoration by mandamus. It was denied and she brought the case to this court on the ground that the validity of an authority exercised under the United States was drawn in question. Dismissing the case, this court said that as she did not question the authority of the President or his representative to dismiss her, but contended only that certain rules and regulations of the civil service had not been observed, the validity of an authority exercised under the United States was not drawn in question, but only the construction and application of regulations of the exercise of such authority. United States ex rel. \n\n[231 U.S. 654, 665]\n\u00a0\n Steinmetz v. Allen was said not to be contrary, 'for there the validity of a rule constituting the authority of certain officers in the Patent Office was drawn in question.'\n Motion to dismiss is denied.\n Joined with the motion to dismiss, we have seen, was a motion to affirm on the ground that the question of the authority of the Secretaries to make the regulation is frivolous in view of the decisions in United States v. Grimaud, \n220 U.S. 506\n, 55 L. ed. 563, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 480; Williamson v. United States, \n207 U.S. 425\n, 52 L. ed. 278, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 163, and other cases. How far this contention is tenable will be developed as we proceed with the consideration of the act and the power of the Secretaries under it.\n The purpose of the act is to secure the purity of food and drugs, and to inform purchasers of what they are buying. Its provisions are directed to that purpose and must be construed to effect it.\n Section 3 gives the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, power to 'make uniform rules and regulations for carrying out the provisions' of the act, and the power to collect specimens of foods and drugs offered in interstate and foreign commerce. It adopts the definitions of the United States Pharmacopoeia or National Formulary, and provides ( 8) that the term 'misbranded,' as used in the act 'shall apply to all drugs . . . the package or label of which shall bear any statement, design, or device regarding such article, or the ingredients or substances contained therein, which shall be false or misleading in any particular.' And, further, in case of drugs, an article shall be deemed to be misbranded 'if the package fail to bear a statement on the label of the quantity or proportion' of certain enumerated substances 'or acetanilid, or any derivative or preparation of any such substances contained therein.'\n These are the applicatory provisions, How are they to be construed? \n\n[231 U.S. 654, 666]\n\u00a0\n First, as to the power of the Secretaries. It is undoubtedly one of regulation only,-an administrative power only,-not a power to alter or add to the act. The extent of the power, however, must be determined by the purpose of the act and the difficulties its execution might encounter. The fact that a council of three Secretaries of governmental departments was given power to make the rules and regulations for the execution of the law shows how complex the matters dealt with were considered to be, and the care that was necessary to be taken to guard against their defeat or perversion. The composition of drugs is a matter of technical skill, their denomination often by words of scholastic origin, conveying no meaning to the uninformed, their uses and abuses learned only by experience, beneficial or evil. It was this experience that the law sought to avail itself of and to avail itself against the ever-increasing powers of the laboratory or the disguises of a technical nomenclature. Hence the provision of the law that the term 'drug,' as used in the act, shall include all medicines and preparations recognized in the United States Pharmacopoeia or National Formulary for internal or external use, and hence also the provision that a drug or food product is misbranded in case it fails to bear a statement on the label of the quantity or proportion or certain enumerated substances, including acetanilid, 'or any derivative or preparation of any such substance contained therein.' Experience had demonstrated the quality of those substances, their effects had become common knowledge; their names, therefore, were all the warning it was necessary for the law to give. But derivative of them might, probably would, be of their quality, so derivatives of them were to be guarded against, and the law hence further provided that the labels on them should state the 'quantity or proportion' of 'any derivative or preparation' of them. This much is clear,-there is no obscurity in the words and purpose of the law. The \n\n[231 U.S. 654, 667]\n\u00a0\n query then occurs, such being the words and purpose, if the quantity or proportion of the substances or any derivative or preparation of them must be stated, is it administrative of the law or additive to it to require by regulation that not only the name of the derivative or preparation be stated, but from what substance derived or of what it is a preparation? It certainly cannot be said that the purpose of the law is not exactly fulfilled by the regulation. If it fulfils the purpose of the law, it cannot be said to be an addition to the law, unless, indeed, it can be contended that the law provided a means for its defeat by the easy device of mysterious names. There is illustration in the present case. What information does the use of the word 'acetphenetidin' convey to anybody of its good or evil origin? If it be said that the like question may be asked of any of the primary substances, we reply that they are the precautions of the law, and adopted as such because they had demonstrated themselves, the value of their use, the detriment of their abuse, and it was believed that their names would carry no deception.\n But let us turn from the power of the Secretaries to the law itself, and inquire if it needs the assistance of a regulation. It is the contention of the government that it does not, that its requirement that the primary substances should be labeled and that their derivatives should be labeled means, necessarily, that it should be stated of what they are the derivatives to make the warning of the labels complete. A great deal of what we have said in discussing the power of the Secretaries applies to this contention and supports it. The purpose of the law is the ever- insistent consideration in its interpretation. The purpose is to prevent the surreptitious sale of certain noxious drugs or their derivatives, the latter supposedly partaking of the quality of parent article and as effective of evil consequences. This being the purpose, did the law leave it unexecuted? We cannot attribute to it such \n\n[231 U.S. 654, 668]\n\u00a0\n defect, and a serious defect it might be. Nor can we consider as a case of omission that which involves so definitely the mischief which was intended to be redressed and which is fairly within the language of the law. And we say this without regard to the various illustrations contained in the government's brief of the deceptions which can be practised by using the name of the derivative alone, for the chemical company insists that we may not, in the absence of allegations and proof, look for knowledge in the encyclopedias, or medical lexicons, or to trade practices for trade disguises, actual or possible. It is not necessary to enter upon the challenged ground. The law furnishes its own tests of what the labels should reveal, and we may grant, for the argument's sake, as contended, that it has penal character; but this does not mean that it should not be given its reasonable intendment. There is no hardship in this, either to the manufacturer or the seller of drugs. They surely know what they make or vend,-know whether it is primary or of what a derivative,-and the law requires only that they put their knowledge on the labels for the information of purchasers. No serious burden is thereby imposed on honest business. Indeed, it makes the label on the packages an assurance as well as a warning, and benefits all concerned, manufacturer, seller, and purchaser. And this in the interest of the public health.\n Decree reversed and cause remanded, with directions to reverse the decree of the Supreme Court and remand the cause, with direction to overrule the exceptions to the libel. \n\n\n\n","255":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU. S. v. BUCHANAN(1914)\nNo. 589\nArgued: December 3, 1913Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n The grand jury for the district of Colorado indicted Buchanan for a violation of the act 'to prevent unlawful occupancy of the public land.' The indictment charged that in February, 1907, one Edward Scott made a homestead entry, at the proper office, of a quarter section of land in Colorado, and died, March 28, 1910, leaving the homestead entry in full force and effect; that thereafter 'his heirs were in lawful possession of and were engaged in cultivating the said homestead land for the purpose of protecting their right as heirs to the same, until May 9, 1911, when the defendant, Buchanan, wilfully, wickedly, unlawfully, and feloniously did prevent and obstruct said heirs from peaceably entering upon and establishing a settlement and residence on the said homesteaded land of the United States subject to settlement and entry under the public land laws.' The defendant demurred on the ground that the facts charged did not constitute an offense punishable under  3 of the act of February 25, 1885 ( 23 Stat. at L. 322, chap. 149, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1525), which provides: \n\n[232 U.S. 72, 73]\n\u00a0\n 'Sec. 3. That no person, by force, threats, intimidation, or by any fencing or inclosing, or any other unlawful means, shall prevent or obstruct, . . . any person from peaceably entering upon or establishing a settlement or residence on any tract of public land subject to settlement or entry under the public land laws of the United States.'\n The defendant's demurrer was sustained and the government brought the case here under the criminal appeals act.\n Assistant Attorney General Knaebel and Mr. S. W. Williams for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. S. E. Naugle and C. W. Waterman for defendant in error.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Lamar: \n\n[232 U.S. 72, 74]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Lamar, after making the foregoing statement of facts, delivered the opinion of the court:\n The statute under which the defendant was indicted makes it unlawful to prevent 'any person from peaceably entering upon or establishing a settlement or residence on public land, subject to settlement or entry.' The indictment charges that the defendant prevented the heirs of the homesteader 'from entering upon and establishing a settlement and residence on homesteaded lands of the United States subject to settlement and entry.' This difference between the language of the statute-'public land of the United States'-and the charge in the indictment-'homesteaded land of the United States'-raises the question whether, after entry and before patent, land covered by a homestead claim is public land within the meaning of the act 'to prevent unlawful occupancy of the public land.'\n In construing the statute it must be remembered that at the time of its passage in 1885, by tacit consent of the government, any person could graze sheep and cattle upon any part of the public domain. Buford v. Houtz, \n133 U.S. 326\n, 33 L. ed. 620, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 305; Light v. United States, \n220 U.S. 535\n, 55 L. ed. 573, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 485. Many availed themselves of this privilege, and the cattle of different owners fed together on the open prairie, no one claiming that thereby any exclusive right had been acquired. The first fences were built only around very small areas. But from this small beginning the practice rapidly grew, until in some cases vast tracts were fenced in by herdsmen who treated the land as though it was their own property. 5 H. R. 1325, 48th Cong. 1st Sess. These unlawful fences not only closed the roads and obstructed the mails, but there were occasions in which citizens were prevented from peaceably taking possession of these inclosed public lands, and by settlement thereon securing the right to enter the same at the register's office. \n\n[232 U.S. 72, 75]\n\u00a0\n Under these circumstances Congress passed the act intended to protect the rights of the United States as proprietor, by making unlawful 'all inclosures of any public land;' to prevent obstruction of the roads; to create a method for summary removal of fences; and to provide a punishment for those who prevented others from entering upon or establishing a settlement on public land subject to settlement or entry. But all its provisions related to pubic lands-not to private lands; to land subject to entry-not to land which had been entered in the register's office; to land subject to settlement-not to land on which a settlement had already been established. For, as shown by the context, the word 'established' did not mean 'to fix unalterably' (Osborne v. San Diego Land & Town Co. \n178 U.S. 39\n, 44 L. ed. 969, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 860, but to create or set up the settlement which had to be made prior to entry at the register's office in the case of a pre-emptor, and could be so made in the case of a homesteader. Rev. Stat.  2289, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1388, Rev. Stat .  2259, 2263, 2264, act of May 14, 1880, 21 Stat. at L. 140, chap. 89,  3, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1393. Stearns v. United States, 82 C. C. A. 48, 152 Fed. 902(10); 4 Ops. Atty. Gen. 493. These provisions refer not to something to be done in the future, but to a settlement already completed, and require that within thirty days after this finished act, proof of such settlement shall be made. When, on that proof, or compliance with other statutory conditions, entry was made, the pre-emptor or homesteader was entitled to possession, and could protect himself by legal proceedings against intrusion by cattlemen or others. \n Sec. 2289. Every person who is the head of a family. . . shall be entitled to enter one-quarter section. . . of unappropriated public lands . . ..\n Sec. 2259. Every person being the head of a family . . . who has made or hereafter makes a settlement in person on the public lands subject to pre-emption, and who inhabits and improves the same, and who has erected or shall erect a dwelling thereon, is authorized to enter with the register of the land office . . . any number of acres not exceeding 160 . . . upon paying to the United States the minimum price of such land.\n Sec. 2263. Prior to any entries being made under and by virtue of the provisions of  2259, proof of the settlement and improvement thereby required shall be made to the satisfaction of the register . . ..\n Sec. 2264. When any person settles or improves a tract of land subject at the time of settlement to private entry, and intends to purchase the same under the preceding provisions of this chapter, he shall, within thirty days after the date of such settlement, file with the register of the proper district a written statement, describing the land settled upon, and declaring his intention to claim the same under the pre- emption law; and he shall, moreover, within twelve months after the date of such settlement, make the proof, affidavit, and payment hereinbefore required. If he fails to file such written statement, or to make such affidavit, proof, and payment within the several periods named above, the tract of land so settled and improved shall be subject to the entry of any other purchaser. \n\n[232 U.S. 72, 76]\n\u00a0\n The indictment here charges that, after having entered this quarter section at the register's office, Scott remained in possession for three years, and that when he died the homestead was in full force and was thereafter maintained by his heirs. This negatives any idea of abandonment. It implies that he not only entered the land at the proper office, but had established a settlement, erected a dwelling, and both acquired and maintained that 'inceptive right' which 'was the commencement of title.' Chotard v. Pope, 12 Wheat. 588, 6 L. ed. 738; Hoofnagle v. Anderson, 7 Wheat. 212, 5 L. ed. 437.\n The land covered by the homestead of Scott was therefore not public land of the United States, subject to entry or settlement. For, 'in no just sense can land be said to be public lands after they have been entered at the land office and a certificate of entry obtained. If public land before the entry, after it they are private property.' Wisconsin C. R. Co. v. Price County, \n133 U.S. 506\n, 33 L. ed. 693, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 341; Svor v. Morris, \n227 U.S. 524\n-528, 57 L. ed. 623-625, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 385. The entry by Scott withdrew the land from entry or settlement by any other, \n\n[232 U.S. 72, 77]\n\u00a0\n and segregated the quarter section from the public domain. The legal title remained in the government until patent issued; but, as against all except the United States, he was the lawful possessor, clothed with an inceptive title (Sturr v. Beck, \n133 \nU.S. 547, 549\n, 33 S. L. ed. 764, 765, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 350; Bunker Hill & S. Min. & Concentrating Co. v. United States, \n226 U.S. 550\n, 57 L. ed. 346, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 138), which entitled him to maintain suits in equity or actions at law to obtain redress for a violation of his possessory rights (Russian-American Packing Co. v. United States, \n199 U.S. 577\n, 50 L. ed. 315, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 157). The homesteader having thus acquired the right to 'treat the land as his own' so far as was necessary to carry out the purposes of the statute (Shiver v. United States, \n159 U.S. 497\n, 40 L. ed. 232, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 54), it is apparent that this right was in the nature of private property, and entitled to protection as such. Interference with the possession of the homesteader or his heirs living on land thus withdrawn from entry was not punishable under a Federal statute applicable only to public lands subject to entry.\n This view is sustained by the terms of the statute, and is in accord with the policy to leave the protection of such possessory claims to the laws of the several states. Congress could have legislated so as to make the statute applicable until patent issued. But instead of doing so, it left the homesteader who had acquired a possessory title to avail himself of the same rights that were open to others holding lands by title absolute or inchoate. In both cases there was right of possession, and in both cases wrongs against possession could be redressed. Such seems to have been the practical construction of the statute since its passage, twenty-eight years ago, for we are cited to no case in which a prosecution has been instituted, in a Federal court, against one interfering with the possession of a homesteader after entry and before patent.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","256":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU. S. v. FIRST NAT. BANK OF DETROIT, MINN.(1914)\nNo. 873\nArgued: April 7, 1914Decided: June 8, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 245, 246]\n\u00a0\n These suits were brought by the United States in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Minnesota against the appellees, to set aside certain conveyances under and through which the appellees claimed title to lands, particularly described, in the White Earth Indian Reservation in Minnesota. The decree of the district court (which had succeeded the circuit court) in the first two cases in favor of the government was reversed by the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit, while the decree dismissing the bill in the last case was affirmed (208 Fed. 988).\n By the treaty of March 19, 1867 (16 Stat. at L. 719), creating the White Earth Indian Reservation, the Chippewas of the Mississippi ceded all their land in Minnesota, except certain described tracts, to the United States, and the government set apart the White Earth Reservation for their use, and provision was made for the certification to each Indian of not to exceed 160 acres of the land to such reservation in lots of 40 acres each, upon the cultivation of 10 acres, provided, that the land should be exempt from taxation and sale for debt, and should not be alienated \n\n[234 U.S. 245, 247]\n\u00a0\n except with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, and then only to a Chippewa Indian. The act of February 8, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 388, chap. 119), provided for the allotment of land in the Indian reservations in severalty to the Indians, and that ( 5) upon the approval of the allotments patents should issue therefor in the name of the allottees, which should be of the legal effect and declare that the United States held the land for twenty-five years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian to whom the allotment was made, or, in case of his death, of his heirs, according to the laws of the state or territory where the land was located, and that, at the expiration of that time, the United States would convey the same to the Indian or his heirs in fee, discharged of the trust, and free of all charge or encumbrance whatsoever; provided that the President of the United States might, in his discretion, extend the period, and provided that any conveyance or contract touching the lands before the expiration of the trust period should be null and void. The Nelson act of January 14, 1889 (25 Stat. at L. 642, chap. 24), provided for the relinquishment to the United States of that part of the reservation remaining after the allotment, subject to the act of February 8, 1887, supra, in severalty, to the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota, the act to become operative only upon the assent of a certain number of Indians being obtained. By the act of February 28, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 794, chap. 383), the allotments were limited to 80 acres to each Indian; but by the Steenerson act of April 28, 1904 (33 Stat. at L. 539, chap. 1786), the maximum allotments of the White Earth Reservation were made 160 acres. The acts of June 21, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 325, 353, chap. 3504), and March 1, 1907 (34 Stat. at L. 1015, 1034, chap 2285), in what is known as the Clapp amendment, removed the restrictions upon alienation as respects mixed- blood Indians, but left the matter, so far as full bloods were concerned, to the Secretary of the Interior.\n The government relied, in the first case, upon its title \n\n[234 U.S. 245, 248]\n\u00a0\n to a certain parcel of land as a part of the public domain set apart as the White Earth Reservation, and the fact that, although, under the various acts of Congress above mentioned, authority was given to segregate certain parcels of land from others in the reservation, and to allot them to members of the band, and O-bah-baum, an Indian woman of that tribe, had been given a trust patent, as provided for by the act of February 8, 1887, supra, and had given a mortgage to the defendant in that case upon such land, she had no right or authority so to do. It prayed that the mortgage be annulled, as being a cloud upon the government's title.\n The allegations of the complaints in the second and third cases are the same, except that the allottee in the former is named Bay-bah-mah-ge- wabe, and in the latter Equay-zaince, and in both cases that there are outstanding warranty deeds and mortgages, that there were intermediate parties not made parties of record, and that an accounting was asked for timber already cut, and an injunction from cutting standing timber.\n The defendant in the first case, besides denying that the reservation was a part of the public domain, and alleging that the property was that of the Indians, and that, after selection, the allottee acquired a feesimple title, notwithstanding the acts of Congress, particularly set up the fact that O-bah-baum is a mixed-blood Chippewa Indian, and one of the class referred to in the Clapp amendment, and therefore emancipated from the pretended supervision of the government, and able to transfer her property as a citizen of the United States. The defendant also alleged that, under the facts, the Indians having made affidavit that they were mixed bloods and the good faith of the defendant, the government should be required to place the defendant in statu quo before the relief asked could be granted. The lumber company, defendant in the second case, and the defendants in the third case, filed \n\n[234 U.S. 245, 249]\n\u00a0\n answers of similar purport, with the additional averment that, under the facts stated, the matter relating to the timber was immaterial; but, if the court found against defendants' title, they would account for the timber cut by them.\n By stipulation or introduction in evidence the following facts were made to appear:\n The three Indians here involved are adult Chippewa Indians, residing upon the White Earth Reservation. O-bah-baum has some white blood, derived from a remote ancestor, but not to exceed one thirty-second; Bay-bah-mah- ge-wabe has one sixteenth of white blood, and Equay-zaince has one eighth of white blood.\n A question having arisen with reference to the construction of the term 'mixed blood,' as used in the treaty of September 30, 1854 (10 Stat. at L. 1109), between the United States and the Chippewa Indians of Lake Superior and the Mississippi, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in a letter to the Indian agent at Detroit, Michigan, said that 'the term 'mixed-bloods' has been construed to mean all who are identified as having a mixture of Indian and white blood. The particular proportion of each blood is therefore immaterial, where the provision is so broad as that stated in the treaty.'\n The Indian agent at the White Earth Reservation, after the passage of the Clapp amendment, came to Washington to consult the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and was referred by him to the Land Division; and, after discussing the situation with a man represented to be in charge of such matters, it was agreed that the act did not require a showing of any definite quantum of foreign blood to constitute a mixed blood, and to his knowledge this was the construction generally adopted by those who dealt with the Indians on the White Earth Reservation. The Chief of the Land Division at the time of the passage of the Clapp amendment testified that, to his knowledge, no ques- \n\n[234 U.S. 245, 250]\n\u00a0\n tion was raised as to the quantum of foreign blood. In a communication dated October 6, 1910, to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, the Special Assistant to the Attorney General and the special Indian agent at Detroit, Minnesota, expressed the belief that the attorneys for the government were going to contend that the term 'mixed blood' should be interpreted to embrace only those of half or less of Indian blood, and cited a certain act of the United States (of February 6, 1909, 35 Stat. at L. 600, chap. 80) in which the term 'Indian' was defined to include the aboriginal races inhabiting Alaska when annexed to the United States, and their descendants of the whole or half blood, which act concerned the sale of liquor or firearms to an Indian or half breed. They also cited certain treaties with the Chippewas wherein it was shown that half breeds are persons of less than half blood, and not regarded as Indians or members of the Chippewa nation: article 3 of the treaty of July 29, 1837 (7 Stat. at L. 536), article 4 of the treaty of October 4, 1842 (7 Stat. at L. 591), article 4 of the treaty of August 2, 1847 (9 Stat. at L. 904), article 6 of the treaty of February 22, 1855 (10 Stat. at L. 1165), and article 4 of the treaty of March 19, 1867 (16 Stat. at L. 719), from which it was summarized that in these treaties persons classed as half breeds or mixed bloods, or less than half blood, were not recognized by the government or the Chippewas as Indians entitled to the rights and privileges of Chippewa Indians unless by special provisions of treaties, as theretofore shown. The Second Assistant Commissioner, in his reply of November 19, 1910, stated that the Office was inclined to give the expressions 'full bloods' and 'mixed bloods' their ordinary meaning, which would be more reasonable than to hold that the term 'full bloods' included those of admitted pure blood and others above the half blood. It was also said in his letter, however, that a conference would be had with the Department of Justice, and further advice given. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs \n\n[234 U.S. 245, 251]\n\u00a0\n said that he had never given an official construction to the term 'mixed blood.'\n It was stipulated that, in administering the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the Clapp amendment, and especially in issuing patents thereunder, the Department had not required any statement as to the quantum of foreign blood, but had issued patents upon the showing that the applicant was a mixed blood. Several instances were shown by the records of allotments having been made to allottees on the White Earth Reservation having but one sixteenth or one thirty-second of Indian blood, while other instances were shown where allotment had been denied because applicant was of 'doubtful blood.'\n A white man who had resided for a long time among the Chippewa Indians stated that in the early period the terms 'mixed blood' and 'half breed' were synonymous, applying to one of mixed white and Indian blood, irrespective of the percentage, and that later the term 'mixed blood' was more commonly used, while the term 'half breed' was applied to one having nearly equal parts of white and Indian blood. The general impression of business men in and about the White Earth Reservation was that any Indian who had white blood in his veins was a mixed blood.\n Several very elderly Indians testified, however, that the Indians regarded the term 'mixed blood' as applying to those having practically half white and half Indian blood.\n The district court, after stating that the question was one of first impression, said that Congress intended competency to be the test, and came to the conclusion that an Indian having an admixture of one eighth white blood might come within the term, but that beyond that the white blood would not affect the capacity of the Indian to manage his own affairs, and therefore dismissed the bill in the third case and entered a decree in favor of the complainants in the other two cases. The circuit court of appeals reached the conclusion that every Chippewa \n\n[234 U.S. 245, 252]\n\u00a0\n Indian having an identifiable mixture of other than Indian blood, however small, is a mixed-blood Indian, and all others are full-blood Indians within the meaning of the Clapp amendment, and accordingly reversed the decree of the district court in the first two cases and affirmed the decree in the third case.\n Solicitor General Davis and Messrs. C. C. Daniels and W. A. Norton for appellant.\n\n\n[234 U.S. 245, 253]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ransom J. Powell, George T. Simpson, and Ernest C. Carman for appellees.\n\n Statement by Mr. Justice Day:\n\n\n[234 U.S. 245, 257]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:\n Before the transfers here complained of, and while the lands were held in trust, subject to the provisions of the act of February 8, 1887, supra, the Clapp amendment was passed, having the purpose of removing the restrictions upon alienation in certain cases. This act provides:\n'That all restrictions as to the sale, encumbrance, or taxation for allotments within the White Earth Reservation in the state of Minnesota, heretofore [amended March 1, 1907, the word 'heretofore' being substituted for the word 'now'] or hereafter held by adult mixed-blood Indians, are hereby removed, and the trust deeds heretofore or hereafter executed by the Department for such allotments are hereby declared to pass the title in fee simple, or such mixed bloods upon application shall be entitled to receive a patent in fee simple for such allotments; and as to full bloods, said restrictions shall be removed when the Secretary of the Interior is satisfied that said adult full-blood Indians are competent to handle their own affairs, and in such case the Secretary of the Interior shall issue to such Indian allottee a patent in fee simple upon application.' \n\n[234 U.S. 245, 258]\n\u00a0\n It is at once apparent from reading this act that it deals with two classes,-adult mixed-blood Indians, concerning whom all restrictions as to sale, encumbrance, or taxation are removed, and full-blood Indians, whose right to be free from restrictions shall rest with the Secretary of the Interior, who may remove the same upon being satisfied that such full- blood Indians are competent to handle their own affairs.\n\n This case turns upon the construction of the words 'mixed-blood Indians.' It is the contention of the government that mixed blood means those of half white or more than half white blood, while the appellees insist, and this was the view adopted by the circuit court of appeals, that the term 'mixed blood' includes all who have an identifiable mixture of white blood. If the government's contention be correct, it follows that, for the purposes of this suit, all of less than half white blood must be regarded as full-blood Indians, all others as mixed bloods. Upon the appellees' contention the line is drawn between full bloods as one class, and all having an identifiable admixture of white blood as the other.\n If we apply the general rule of statutory construction that words are to be given their usual and ordinary meaning, it would seem clear that the appellees' construction is right; for a full blood is obviously one of pure blood, thoroughbred, having no admixture of foreign blood. That this natural and usual signification of plain terms is to be adopted as the legislative meaning in the absence of clear showing that something else was meant is an elementary rule of construction frequently recognized and followed in this court. United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch, 358, 399, 2 L. ed. 304, 317; Lake County v. Rollins, \n130 \nU.S. 662, 670\n, 32 S. L. ed. 1060, 1063, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 651; Dewey v. United States, \n178 \nU.S. 510, 521\n, 44 S. L. ed. 1170, 1174, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 981. Interpreted according to the plain import of the words, the persons intended to be reached by the clause are divided into two, and only two, well-defined classes,-full- blood Indians and mixed \n\n[234 U.S. 245, 259]\n\u00a0\n bloods. There is no suggestion of a third class, having more than half of white blood or any other proportion than is indicated in the term 'mixed blood,' as contrasted with full blood. If the government's contention is correct, the Indians of full blood must necessarily include half bloods, and mixed bloods must mean all having less than half white blood, and none others. Such construction is an obvious wresting of terms of plain import from their usual and well-understood signification.\n But the government insists that to effect the legislative purpose the words must be interpreted as the Indians understood them, and cases from this court (Jones v. Meehan, \n175 U.S. 1\n, 44 L. ed. 49, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1; Starr v. Long Jim, \n227 U.S. 613\n, 57 L. ed. 670, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 358) are cited to the effect that Indian treaties and acts to which the Indians must give consent before they become operative must be interpreted so as to conform to the understanding of the Indians as to the meaning of the terms used. The justice and propriety of this method of interpretation are obvious and essential to the protection of an unlettered race, dealing with those of better education and skill, themselves framing contracts which the Indians are induced to sign. But the legislation here in question is not in the nature of contract, and contains no provision that makes it effectual only upon consent of the Indians whose rights and privileges are to be affected. Evidently this legislation contemplated in some measure the rights of others who might deal with the Indians, and obviously was intended to enlarge the right to acquire as well as to part with lands held in trust for the Indians.\n The government refers, in support of its contention, to reports of congressional committees, showing after effects of this legislation, which was followed, as the reports tend to show, by improvident sales and encumbrances of Indian lands and wasteful extravagance in the disposition of the proceeds of sales, resulting in suffering to the former proprietors of the lands sold and mortgaged. But \n\n[234 U.S. 245, 260]\n\u00a0\n these after effects can have little weight in determining the meaning of the legislation, and certainly cannot overcome the meaning of plain words used in legislative enactments. If the effect of the legislation has been disastrous to the Indians, that fact will not justify the courts in departing from the terms of the act as written. If the true construction has been followed with harsh consequences, it cannot influence the courts in administering the law. The responsibility for the justice or wisdom of legislation rests with the Congress, and it is the province of the courts to enforce, not to make, the laws. St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281, 294\n, 52 S. L. ed. 1061, 1067, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 616, 21 Am. Neg. Rep. 464; United States ex rel. Texas Portland Cement Co. v. McCord, \n233 \nU.S. 157, 163\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 550.\n The government further insists that its interpretation of the act is consistent with its policy to make competency the test of the right to alienate, and that the legislation in question proceeds upon the theory that those of half or more white blood are more likely to be able to take care of themselves in making contracts and disposing of their lands than those of lesser admixture of such blood. But the policy of the government in passing legislation is often an uncertain thing, as to which varying opinions may be formed, and may, as is the fact in this case, afford an unstable ground of statutory interpretation. Hadden v. The Collector ( Hadden v. Barney), 5 Wall. 107, 111, 18 L. ed. 518, 519. And again, Congress has in other legislation not hesitated to place full-blood Indians in one class and all others in another. Marchie Tiger v. Western Invest. Co. \n221 U.S. 286\n, 55 L. ed. 738, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 578. In that case this court had occasion to deal with certain sections of the act of April 26, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 137, chap. 1876), providing that no full- blood Indian of certain tribes should have power to alienate or encumber allotted lands for a period of twenty-five years, unless restrictions were removed by act of Congress. By  22 of the act all adult heirs of deceased Indians were given the right to convey their lands, but for the last sentence of the section, which kept full- \n\n[234 U.S. 245, 261]\n\u00a0\n blood Indians to their right to convey under the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior. Therefore all adult heirs of any deceased Indian other than a full blood might convey, but the full blood only with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. In this important provision the restrictions were removed as to all classes of Indians other than full bloods. In other words, there as here, the Indians were divided into two classes,-full bloods in one class and all others in the second class.\n Furthermore, the appellees' construction accords with the departmental construction, as shown by the facts stipulated. Such was the construction given by the Indian Commissioner to the treaty of September 30, 1854, 10 Stat. at L. 1109, wherein provision was made for mixed-blood Indians among the Chippewas, and the Indian agent at Detroit, Michigan, was instructed by the Indian Commissioner that the term 'mixed blood' had been construed to mean all who are identified as having a mixture of Indian and white blood. Such was the interpretation of the Department of Interior, in the first place, at least, in administering the matter under the Clapp amendment. It is true that the government representatives at Detroit, Minnesota, were of the opposite opinion, for the reasons we have stated above, and that the Second Assistant Commissioner, in his reply, while reaching the conclusion we have, stated that he would confer with the Department of Justice.\n While departmental construction of the Clapp amendment does not have the weight which such constructions sometimes have in long-continued observance, nevertheless it is entitled to consideration,-the early administration of that amendment showing the interpretation placed upon it by competent men having to do with its enforcement. The conviction is very strong that if Congress intended to remove restrictions only from those who had half white blood or more, it would have inserted in the \n\n[234 U.S. 245, 262]\n\u00a0\n act the words necessary to make that intention clear; that is, we deem this a case for the application of the often expressed consideration, aiding interpretation, that if a given construction was intended, it would have been easy for the legislative body to have expressed it in apt terms. Farrington v. Tennessee, \n95 \nU.S. 679, 689\n, 24 S. L. ed. 558, 561; Union Nat. Bank v. Matthews, \n98 \nU.S. 621, 627\n, 25 S. L. ed. 188, 189; Tompkins v. Little Rock, & H. S. R. Co. \n125 \nU.S. 109, 127\n, 31 S. L. ed. 615, 624, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 762; United States v. Lexington Mill & Elevator Co., \n232 \nU.S. 399, 410\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 337.\n Congress was very familiar with the situation, the subject having been before it in many debates and discussions concerning Indian affairs. This was a reservation inhabited by Indians of full blood and others of all degrees of mixed blood, some with a preponderance of white blood, others with less, and many with very little. If Congress, having competency in mind, and that alone, had intended to emancipate from the prevailing restriction on alienation only those who were half white or more, by a few simple words it could have effected that purpose. We cannot believe that such was the congressional intent, and we are clearly of opinion that the courts may not supply the words which Congress omitted. Nor can such course be induced by any consideration of public policy or the desire to promote justice, if such would be its effect, in dealing with dependent people.\n We reach the conclusion that the Circuit Court of Appeals rightly construed this statute, and its decrees are affirmed. \n\n\n\n","257":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.

Blair in behalf of\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 399, 404]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ralph S. Rounds as amicus curia.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n The petitioner, the United States of America, proceeding under  10 of the food and drugs act (34 Stat. at L. 768, chap. 3915, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1354), by libel filed in the district court of the United States for the western district of Missouri, sought to seize and condemn 625 sacks of flour in the possession of one Terry, which had been shipped from Lexington, Nebraska, to Castle, Missouri, and which remained in original, unbroken packages. The judgment of the district court, upon verdict in favor of the government, was reversed by the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit (121 C. C. A. 23, 202 Fed. 615), and this writ of certiorari is to review the judgment of that court. \n\n[232 U.S. 399, 405]\n\u00a0\n The amended libel charged that the flour had been treated by the 'Alsop Process,' so called, by which nitrogen peroxide gas, generated by electricity, was mixed with atmospheric air, and the mixture then brought in contact with the flour, and that it was thereby adulterated under the fourth and fifth subdivisions of  7 of the act; namely, (1) in that the flour had been mixed, colored, and stained in a manner whereby damage and inferiority were coneealed and the flour given the appearance of a better grade of flour than it really was, and (2) in that the flour had been caused to contain added poisonous or other added deleterious ingredients, to-wit, nitrites or nitrite reacting material, nitrogen peroxide, nitrous acid, nitric acid, and other poisonous and deleterious substances which might render the flour injurious to health. The libel also charged that the flour was adulterated under the first subdivision of  7, and was misbranded; but the government does not urge these features of the case here. The verdict was broad enough to cover the charge under the first subdivision of  7, but in the view we take of the case as to the instruction of the court under subdivision 5 need not be noticed.\n The Lexington Mill & Elevator Company, the respondent herein, appeared, claiming the flour, and answered the libel, admitting that the flour had been treated by the Alsop Process, but denying that it had been adulterated, and attacking the constitutionality of the act\n A special verdict to the effect that the flour was adulterated was returned and judgment of condemnation entered. The case was taken to the circuit court of appeals upon writ of error. The respondent contended that, among other errors, the instructions of the trial court as to adulteration were erroneous and that the act was unconstitutional. The circuit court of appeals held that the testimony was insufficient to show that by the \n\n[232 U.S. 399, 406]\n\u00a0\n bleaching process the flour was so colored as to ceonceal inferiority, and was thereby adulterated, within the provisions of subdivision 4. That court also held-and this holding gives rise to the principal controversy here-that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the addition of a poisonous substance, in any quantity, would adulterate the article, for the reason that 'the possibility of injury to health due to the added ingredient, and in the quantity in which it is added, is plainly made an essential element of the prohibition.' It did not pass upon the constitutionality of the act, in view of its rulings on the act's construction.\n The case requires a construction of the food and drugs act. Parts of the statute pertinent to this case are:\n'Sec. 7. That for the purposes of this act an article shall be deemed to be adulterated: . . .\n\n'In the case of food:\n\n'First. If any substance has been mixed and packed with it so as to reduce or lower or injuriously affect its quality or strength. . . .\n\n'Fourth. If it be mixed, colored, powdered, coated, or stained in a manner whereby damage or inferiority is concealed.\n\n'Fifth. If it contain any added poisonous or other added deleterious ingredient which may render such article injurious to health. . . .\n\n'Sec. 10. That any article of food, drug, or liquor that is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of this act, and is being transported from one state, territory, district, or insular possession to another for sale, or, having been transported, remains unloaded, unsold, or in original unbroken packages, . . . shall be liable to be proceeded against in any district court of the United States within the district where the same is found, and seized for confiscation by a process of libel for \n\n[232 U.S. 399, 407]\n\u00a0\n condemnation. And if such article is condemned as being adulterated or misbranded, or of a poisonous or deleterious character, within the meaning of this act, the same shall be disposed of by destruction or sale, as the said court may direct.'\n\n Without reciting the testimony in detail it is enough to say that for the government it tended to show that the added poisonous substances introduced into the flour by the Alsop Process, in the proportion of 1.8 parts per million, calculated as nitrogen, may be injurious to the health of those who use the flour in bread and other forms of food. On the other hand, the testimony for the respondent tended to show that the process does not add to the flour any poisonous or deleterious ingredients which can in any manner render it injurious to the health of a consumer. On these conflicting proofs the trial court was required to submit the case to the jury. That court-after stating the claims of the parties, the government insisting that the flour was adulerated and should be condemned if it contained any added poisonous or other added deleterious ingredient of a kind or character which was capable of rendering such article injurious to health; the respondent contending that the flour should not be condemned unless the added substances were present in such quantity that the flour would be thereby rendered injurious to health-gave certain instructions to the jury. Part of the charge, excepted to by the respondent reads:\n'The fact that poisonous substances are to be found in the bodies of human beings in the air, in potable water, and in articles of food, such as ham, bacon, fruits, certain vegetables, and other articles, does not justify the adding of the same or other poisonous substances to articles of food, such as flour, because the statute condemns the adding of poisonous substances. Therefore the court charges you that the government need not prove that this flour, or foodstuffs made by the use of it, would injure \n\n[232 U.S. 399, 408]\n\u00a0\n the health of any consumer. It is the character-not the quantity-of the added substance, if any, which is to determine this case.'\n\n On the other hand, the respondent insisted that the law is, and requested the court to charge the jury:\n'That the burden is upon the prosecution to prove the truth of the charge in the libel, that by the treatment of the flour in question by the said Alsop Process it has been caused to contain added poisonous or other added deleterious ingredients, to wit, nitrites or nitrite reacting material, which may render said flour injurious to health.\n\n'And in this connection you are further instructed that it is incumbent upon the government to prove that any such added poisonous or other added deleterious ingredients, if any, contained in said flour, are of such a character and contained in the flour seized in such quantities, conditions, and amounts as may render said flour injurious to health; and unless you find that all of such facts are so proven you cannot find against the claimant, or condemn the flour in question under that charge in the libel; and if you fail to so find, your verdict upon that count or charge in the libel must be in favor of the claimant or defendant.\n\n ... * *\n'The law does not prohibit the adding of nitrites or nitrite reacting material to flour, and a jury cannot find for the government or against the claimant, even if it be shown that nitrites or nitrite reacting material was added to the flour in question, unless they believe from a preponderance of the evidence that such addition, if any, rendered said flour injurious to the health of those who might consume the bread or other foods made from said flour.'\n\n It is evident from the charge given and refused that the trial court regarded the addition to the flour of any poisonous ingredient as an offense within this statute, no \n\n[232 U.S. 399, 409]\n\u00a0\n matter how small the quantity, and whether the flour sight or might not injure the health of the consumer. At least, such is the purport of the part of the charge above given, and if not correct, it was clearly misleading, notwithstanding other parts of the charge seem to recognize that, in order to prove adulteration, it is necessary to show that the flour may be injurious to health. The testimony shows that the effect of the Alsop Process is to bleach or whiten the flour, and thus make it more marketable. If the testimony introduced on the part of the respondent was believed by the jury, they must necessarily have found that the added ingredient, nitrites of a poisonous character, did not have the effect to make the consumption of the flour by any possibility injurious to the health of the consumer.\n The statute upon its face shows that the primary purpose of Congress was to prevent injury to the public health by the sale and transportation in interstate commerce of misbranded and adulterated foods. The legislation, as against misbranding, intended to make it possible that the consumer should know that an article purchased was what it purported to be; that it might be bought for what it really was, and not upon misrepresentations as to character and quality. As against adulteration, the statute was intended to protect the public health from possible injury by adding to articles of food consumption poisonous and deleterious substances which might render such articles injurious to the health of consumers. If this purpose has been effected by plain and unambiguous language, and the act is within the power of Congress, the only duty of the courts is to give it effect according to its terms. This principle has been frequently recognized in this court. Lake County v. Rollins, \n130 \nU.S. 662, 670\n, 32 S. L. ed. 1060, 1063, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 651.\n'Where a law is expressed in plain and unambiguous terms, whether those terms are general or limited, the legislature should be intended to mean what they have \n\n[232 U.S. 399, 410]\n\u00a0\n plainly expressed, and consequently no room is left for construction.'\n\n Hamilton v. Rathbone, \n175 \nU.S. 414, 421\n, 44 S. L. ed. 219, 222, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 155.\n'The cases are so numerous in this court to the effect that the province of construction lies wholly within the domain of ambiguity, that an extended review of them is quite unnecessary.'\n\n Furthermore, all the words used in the statute should be given their proper signification and effect. Washington Market Co. v. Hoffman, \n101 \nU.S. 112, 115\n, 25 S. L. ed. 782, 783.\n'We are not at liberty,' said Mr. Justice Strong, 'to construe any statute so as to deny effect to any part of its language. It is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that significance and effect shall, if possible, be accorded to every word. As early as in Bacon's Abridgment,  2, it was said that 'a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word, shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.' This rule has been repeated innumerable times.'\n\n Applying these well-known principles in considering this statute, we find that the fifth subdivision of  7 provides that food shall be deemed to be adulterated 'if it contain any added poisonous or other added deleterious ingredient which may render such article injurious to health.' The instruction of the trial court permitted his statute to be read without the final and qualifying words, concerning the effect of the article upon health. If Congress had so intended, the provision would have stopped with the condemnation of food which contained any added poisonous or other added deleterious ingredient. In other words, the first and familiar consideration is that, if Congress had intended to enact the statute in that form, it would have done so by choice of apt words to express that intent. It did not do so, but only condemned food containing an added poisonous or other added deleterious ingredient when such addition might render the article of food in- \n\n[232 U.S. 399, 411]\n\u00a0\n jurious to the health. Congress has here, in this statute, with its penalties and forfeitures, definitely outlined its inhibition against a particular class of adulteration.\n It is not required that the article of food containing added poisonous or other added deleterious ingredients must affect the public health, and it is not incumbent upon the government in order to make out a case to establish that fact. The act has placed upon the government the burden of establishing, in order to secure a verdict of condemnation under this statute, that the added poisonous or deleterious substances must be such as may render such article injurious to health. The word 'may' is here used in its ordinary and usual signification, there being nothing to show the intention of Congress to affix to it any other meaning. It is, says Webster, 'an auxiliary verb, qualifying the meaning of another verb, by expressing ability, . . . contingency or liability, or possibility or probability.' In thus describing the offense, Congress doubtless took into consideration that flour may be used in many ways, in bread, cake, gravy, broth, etc. It may be consumed, when prepared as a food, by the strong and the weak, the old and the young, the well and the sick; and it is intended that if any flour, because of any added poisonous or other deleterious ingredient, may possibly injure the health of any of these, it shall come within the ban of the statute. If it cannot by any possibility, when the facts are reasonably considered, injure the health of any consumer, such flour, though having a small addition of poisonous or deleterious ingredients, may not be condemned under the act. This is the plain meaning of the words, and in our view needs no additional support by reference to reports and debates, although it may be said in passing that the meaning which we have given to the statute was well expressed by Mr. Heyburn, chairman of the committee having it in charge upon the floor of the Senate ( Congressional Record, vol. 40, pt. 2, p. 1131): \n\n[232 U.S. 399, 412]\n\u00a0\n 'As to the use of the term 'poisonous,' let me state that everything which contains poison is not poison. It depends on the quantity and the combination. A very large majority of the things consumed by the human family contain, under analysis, some kind of poison, but it depends upon the combination, the chemical relation which it bears to the body in which it exists, as to whether or not it is dangerous to take into the human system.'\n And such is the view of the English courts construing a similar statute. The English statute provides ( 3, of the sale of food and drugs act 1875):\n'No person shall mix, color, . . . or order or permit any other person to mix, color, . . . any article of food with any ingredient or material so as to render the article injurious to health.'\n\n That section was construed in Hull v. Horsnell, 68 J. P. 591, which involved preserved peas, the color of which had been retained by the addition of sulphate of copper, charged to be a poisonous substance and injurious to health. There was a conviction in the lower court. Lord Alverstone, L. C. J., in reversing and remitting the case on appeal, said:\n'In my opinion, if the justices convicted the appellant of an offense under  3 of the sale of food and drugs act 1875, on the ground that the ingredient mixed with the article of food was injurious to health,-that the sulphate of copper was injurious to health, and not on the ground that the peas, by reason of the addition of sulphate of copper, were rendered injurious to health, the conviction is clearly wrong. To constitute an offense under the latter part of  3 the article of food sold must, by the addition of an ingredient, be rendered injurious to health. All the circumstances must be examined to see whether the article of food has been rendered injurious to health.'\n\n We reach the conclusion that the circuit court of appeals did not err in reversing the judgment of the dis- \n\n[232 U.S. 399, 413]\n\u00a0\n trict court for error in its charge with reference to subdivision 5 of  7.\n The circuit court of appeals reached the conclusion that there was no substantial proof to warrant the conviction, under the fourth subdivision of  7, that the flour was mixed, colored, and stained in a manner whereby damage and inferiority were concealed. As the case is to be retried to a jury, we say nothing more upon this point.\n As to the objection on constitutional grounds, it is not contended that the statute, as construed by the circuit court of appeals and this court, is unconstitutional.\n It follows that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the judgment of the District Court, must be affirmed, and the case remanded to the District Court for a new trial.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","258":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.

The proceeding is under the act of June 25, 1910, chap. 395,  6, 36 Stat. at L. 825, 827, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, pp. 1343, 1345, which requires every person harboring an alien woman for the above purpose within three years after she shall have entered the United States from any country, \n\n[235 U.S. 27, 30]\n\u00a0\n party to the arrangement for the suppression of the white slave traffic, adopted, July 25, 1902, 35 Stat. at L. 1979, to file a statement as aforesaid. A failure to do so is made a misdemeanor, and is punished by fine or imprisonment or both. Great Britain is a party to the arrangement. There was a demurrer to the indictment and it was sustained, as appears by a bill of exceptions, upon the ground set forth in the opinion, that, as the court construed the statute, the above requirement was confined to 'persons who have had to do, directly or indirectly, with the bringing in or sending forth of such women or girls.'\n We see no sufficient reason for the limitation thus read into the generality and literal meaning of the words of the act. It is true that persons who have had to do with bringing the alien into the country are more likely than others to know the facts to be stated, and it may be assumed that others are not required to know them at their peril. It is true that the immunity from prosecution under the laws of the United States for any fact truthfully reported which the section grants most obviously applies to those who have taken part in bringing the woman in. But others who have not taken part are very likely to know the facts or some of them, and their knowledge may be of a kind to raise suspicion of guilt under the act. The requirement is that 'every person' harboring a woman as above shall file the statement. It is, and purports to be, in furtherance of the international agreement. That agreement, among other things, is 'to procure, within the limits of the laws, all information of a nature to discover a criminal traffic' (art. 2, 35 Stat. at L. 1982), although, perhaps, those words look more immediately to the points of departure and arrival and the journey. Taken literally the statute required the defendants to file a statement of any of the facts mentioned that were within their knowledge, and to read it otherwise would deprive the government of a \n\n[235 U.S. 27, 31]\n\u00a0\n considerable source of information, to no good end that we can perceive.\n'We therefore reach the conclusion that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the . . . indictment, so far as that ruling is based upon the construction of the statute in question.'

In both cases the district court held that no offense was charged. 213 Fed. 345, 352. Both indictments for holding certain persons in a state of peonage were found under  1990 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 1266), as follows:\n'The holding of any person to service or labor under the system known as peonage is abolished and forever prohibited in the territory of New Mexico, or in any other territory or state of the United States; and all acts, laws, resolutions, orders, regulations, or usages of the territory of New Mexico, or of any other territory or state, which have heretofore established, maintained, or enforced, or by virtue of which any attempt shall hereafter be made to establish, maintain, or enforce, directly or indirectly, the voluntary or involuntary service or labor of any persons as peons, in liquidation of any debt or obligation, or otherwise, are declared null and void;' and  269 of the Criminal Code [35 Stat. at L. 1142, chap. 321, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1670] ( 5526, Rev. Stat. U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3715), which provides that--\n\n'Whoever holds, arrests, returns, or causes to be held, arrested, or returned, or in any manner aids in the arrest or return, of any person to a condition of peonage, shall be fined not more than five thousand dollars, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.'\n\n The facts to be gathered from the indictments and pleas, upon which the court below decided the cases and determined that no offense was charged against the statutes of the United States as above set forth, are substantially these: In No. 478, one Ed Rivers, having been convicted in a court of Alabama of the offense of petit larceny, was fined $15, and costs , $43.75. The defendant Reynolds appeared as surety for Rivers, and a judgment by confession was entered up against him for the amount of the fine and costs, which Reynolds afterwards paid to the state. On May 4, 1910, Rivers, the convict, entered into a written contract with Reynolds to work for him as a \n\n[235 U.S. 133, 140]\n\u00a0\n farmhand for the term of nine months and twenty-four days, at the rate of $ 6 per month, to pay the amount of fine and costs. The indictment charges that he entered into the service of Reynolds, and under threats of arrest and imprisonment if he ceased to perform such work and labor, he worked until the 6th day of June, when he refused to labor. Thereupon he was arrested upon a warrant issued at the instance of Reynolds from the county court of Alabama, on the charge of violating the contract of service. He was convicted and fined the sum of 1 cent for violating this contract, and additional costs in the amount of $87.05, for which he again confessed judgment with G. W. Broughton as surety, and entered into a similar contract with Broughton to work for him as a farm hand at the same rate, for a term of fourteen months and fifteen days.\n In No. 479, the case against Broughton, E. W. Fields, having been convicted in an Alabama state court, at the July, 1910, term, of the offense of selling mortgaged property, was fined $50 and costs in the additional sum of $69.70. Thereupon Broughton, as surety for Fields, confessed judgment for the sum of fine and costs, and afterwards paid the same to the state. On the 8th day of July, 1910, a contract was entered into, by which Fields agreed to work for Broughton as a farm and logging hand for the term of nineteen months and twenty-nine days, at the rate of $ 6 per month, to pay the fine and costs. He entered into the service of Broughton, and, it was alleged, under threats of arrest and imprisonment if he ceased to labor, he continued so to do until the 14th day of September, 1910, when he refused to labor further. Thereupon Broughton caused the arrest of Fields upon a charge of violating his contract, and upon a warrant issued upon this charge, Fields was again arrested.\n The rulings in the court below upon the plea and demurrers were that there was no violation of the Federal \n\n[235 U.S. 133, 141]\n\u00a0\n statutes, properly construed, and also held that the conduct of the defendants was justified by the provisions of the Alabama Code, upon which they relied. These provisions are as follows:\n'7632. Confession of judgment by defendant for fine and costs.-When a fine is assessed, the court may allow the defendant to confess judgment, with good and sufficient sureties, for the fine and costs.\n\n'7633. Execution issues as in civil cases.-Execution may issue for the fine and costs, or any portion thereof remaining unpaid, as in civil cases.\n\n'7634. On default in payment of fine and costs, imprisonment or hard labor imposed.-If the fine and costs are not paid, or a judgment confessed according to the provisions of the preceding section, the defendant must either be imprisoned in the county jail, or, at the discretion of the court, sentenced to hard labor for the county as follows: If the fine does not exceed $20, ten days; if it exceeds $20 and does not exceed $50, twenty days; if it exceeds $50 and does not exceed $100, thirty days; if it exceeds $100 and does not exceed $150, fifty days; if it exceeds $150 and does not exceed $200, seventy days; if it exceeds $200 and does not exceed $300, ninety days; and for every additional $100, or fractional part thereof, twenty-five days.\n\n'7635. When additional hard labor imposed for costs; rules in reference to.-If, on conviction, judgment is rendered against the accused that he perform hard labor for the county, and if the costs are not presently paid or judgment confessed therefor, as provided by law, then the court may impose additional hard labor for the county for such period, not to exceed ten months, as may be sufficient to pay the costs, at the rate of 75 cents per day, and the court must determine the time required \n\n[235 U.S. 133, 142]\n\u00a0\n to work out such costs at that rate; and such convict must be discharged from the sentence against him for costs on the payment thereof, or any balance due thereon, by the hire of such convict or otherwise; and the certificate of the judge or clerk of the court in which the conviction was had, that the costs, or the residue thereof, after deducting the amount realized from the hire of the convict, have been paid, or that the hire or labor of the convict, as the case may be, amounts to a sum sufficient to pay the costs, shall be sufficient evidence to authorize such discharge.'\n\n'6846. Failure of defendant to perform contract with surety confessing judgment for fine and costs.-Any defendant, on whom a fine is imposed on conviction for a misdemeanor, who in open court signs a written contract, approved in writing by the judge of the court in which the conviction is had, whereby, in consideration of another becoming his surety on a confession of judgment for the fine and costs, agrees to do any act, or perform any service for such person, and who, after being released on such confession of judgment, fails or refuses, without good and sufficient excuse, to be determined by the jury, to do the act, or perform the service, which in such contract he promised or agreed to do or perform, must, on conviction, be fined not less than the amount of the damages which the party contracting with him has suffered by such failure or refusal, and not more than $500; and the jury shall assess the amount of such damages; but no conviction shall be had under this section, unless it is shown on the trial that such contract was filed for record in the office of the judge of probate of the county in which the confession of judgment was had, within ten days after the day of the execution thereof.'\n\n'6848. Damages paid to injured party out of fine imposed.-From the fine imposed under the two preceding sections, when collected, the damages sustained by \n\n[235 U.S. 133, 143]\n\u00a0\n the party contracting with such defendant must be paid to such person by the officer collecting the same.'\n\n The defendants having justified under this system of law, the question for consideration is, Were the defendants well charged with violating the provisions of the Federal statutes, to which we have referred, notwithstanding they undertook to act under the Alabama laws, particularly under the provisions of  6846 of the Alabama Code, authorizing sureties to appear and confess judgment and enter into contracts such as those we have described?\n The 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides:\n'Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\n\n'Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.'\n\n It was under the authority herein conferred, to enforce the provisions of this amendment by appropriate legislation, that Congress passed the sections of the Revised Statutes here under consideration. Clyatt v. United States, \n197 U.S. 207\n, 49 L. ed. 726, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 429; Bailey v. Alabama, \n219 U.S. 219\n, 55 L. ed. 191, 31 Sup. St. Rep. 145.\n By these enactments Congress undertook to strike down all laws, regulations, and usages in the states and territories which attempted to maintain and enforce, directly or indirectly, the voluntary or involuntary service or labor of any persons as peons, in the liquidation of any debt or obligation. To determine whether the conduct of the defendants charged in the indictments amounted to holding the persons named in a state of peonage, it is essential to understand what Congress meant in the use of that term prohibiting and punishing those guilty of maintaining it. Extended discussion of this subject is rendered unnecessary in view of the full consideration thereof in the prior adjudications of this \n\n[235 U.S. 133, 144]\n\u00a0\n court. Clyatt v. United States and Bailey v. Alabama, supra.\n Peonage is a 'condition of compulsory service, based upon the indebtedness of the peon to the master. The basal fact is indebtedness . . . . 'One fact existed universally; all were indebted to their masters . . . .' Upon this is based a condition of compulsory service. Peonage is sometimes classified as voluntary or involuntary, but this implies simply a difference in the mode of origin, but none in the character of the servitude. The one exists where the debtor voluntarily contracts to enter the service of his creditor. The other is forced upon the debtor by some provision of law. But peonage, however created, is compulsory service, involuntary servitude. The peon can release himself therefrom, it is true, by the payment of the debt, but otherwise the service is enforced. A clear distinction exists between peonage and the voluntary performance of labor or rendering of services in payment of a debt. In the latter case, the debtor, though contracting to pay his indebtedness by labor or service, and subject like any other contractor to an action for damages for breach of that contract, can elect at any time to break it, and no law or force compels performance or a continuance of the service.' Clyatt v. United States, supra.\n Applying this definition to the facts here shown, we must determine whether the convict was in reality working for a debt which he owed the surety, and whether the labor was performed under such coercion as to become a compulsory service for the discharge of a debt. If so, it amounts to peonage, within the prohibition of the Federal statutes. The actual situation is this: The convict, instead of being committed to work and labor as the statute provides for the state, when his fines and costs are unpaid, comes into court with a surety, and confesses judgment in the amount of fine and costs, and agrees \n\n[235 U.S. 133, 145]\n\u00a0\n with the surety, in consideration of the payment of that fine and costs, to perform service for the surety after he is released because of the confession of judgment. The form of the contract, said to be the usual one entered into in such cases, in given in the record, and reads:\n Labor Contract.\n The state of Alabama, Monroe county:\n Whereas, at the May term, 1910, of the county court, held in and for said county, I, Ed. Rivers, was convicted in said court of the offense of petit larceny and fined the sum of $15, and judgment has been rendered against me for the amount of said fine, and also in the further and additional sum of forty-three and 75\/100 dollars, cost in said case, and whereas J. A. Reynolds, together with A. C. Hixon, have confessed judgment with me in said court for said fine and costs. Now, in consideration of the premises, I, the said Ed. Rivers, agree to work and labor for him, the said J. A. Reynolds, on his plantation in Monroe county, Alabama, and under his direction as a farm hand to pay fine and costs for the term nine months and twenty-four days, at the rate of $6 per month, together with my board, lodging, and clothing during the said time of hire, said time of hire commencing on the 4 day of May, 1910, and ending on the 28 day of Feby., 1911, provided said work is not dangerous in its character.\n Witness our hands this 4 day of May, 1910\n\n\n Ed (his x mark) Rivers.\n J. A. Reynolds.\n Witness:\n John M. Coxwell.\n It also stands admitted in this record that the sureties in fact paid the judgment confessed. Looking, then, to the substance of things, and through the mere form which they have taken, we are to decide the question whether the labor of the convict, thus contracted for, amounted to \n\n[235 U.S. 133, 146]\n\u00a0\n involuntary service for the liquidation of a debt to the surety, which character of service it was the intention of the acts of Congress to prevent and punish. When thus at labor, the convict is working under a contract which he has made with his surety. He is to work until the amount which the surety has paid for him-the sum of the fine and costs-is paid. The surety has paid the state and the service is rendered to reimburse him. This is the real substance of the transaction. The terms of that contract are agreed upon by the contracting parties, as the result of their own negotiations. The statute of the state does not prescribe them. It leaves the making of contract to the parties concerned, and this fact is not changed because of the requirement that the judge shall approve of the contract. When the convict goes to work under this agreement, he is under the direction and control of the surety, and is in fact working for him. If he keeps his agreement with the surety, he is discharged from its obligations without any further action by the state. This labor is performed under the constant coercion and threat of another possible arrest and prosecution in case he violates the labor contract which he has made with the surety, and this form of coercion is as potent as it would have been had the law provided for the seizure and compulsory service of the convict. Compulsion of such service by the constant fear of imprisonment under the criminal laws renders the work compulsory, as much so as authority to arrest and hold his person would be if the law authorized that to be done. Bailey v. Alabama, \n219 U.S. 244\n, 55 L. ed. 202, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 145; Ex parte Hollman, 79 S. C. 9, 21 L.R.A.(N.S.) 242, 60 S. E. 24, 14 Ann. Cas. 1105.\n Under this statute, the surety may cause the arrest of the convict for violation of his labor contract. He may be sentenced and punished for this new offense, and undertake to liquidate the penalty by a new contract of a similar nature, and, if again broken, may be again prosecuted, and the convict is thus kept chained to an ever- \n\n[235 U.S. 133, 147]\n\u00a0\n turning wheel of servitude to discharge the obligation which he has incurred to his surety, who has entered into an undertaking with the state, or paid money in his behalf. The rearrest of which we have spoken is not because of his failure to pay his fine and costs originally assessed against him by the state. He is arrested at the instance of the surety, and because the law punishes the violation of the contract which the convict has made with him.\n Nor is the labor for the surety by any means tantamount to that which the state imposes if no such contract has been entered into, as these cases afford adequate illustration. In the case against Reynolds, Rivers was sentenced to pay $15 fine and $43.75 costs. Under the Alabama Code, he might have been sentenced to hard labor for the county for ten days for the nonpayment of the fine, and assuming that he could be sentenced for nonpayment of costs under  7635 of the Alabama Code, he could have worked it out at the rate of 75 cents per day, an additional fifty-eight days might have been added, making sixty-eight days as his maximum sentence at hard labor. Under the contract now before us, he was required to labor for nine months and twenty-four days, thus being required to perform a much more onerous service than if he had been sentenced under the statute, and committed to hard labor. Failing to perform the service, he may be again rearrested, as he was in fact in this case, and another judgment confessed to pay a fine of 1 cent and $87.05 costs, for which the convict was bound to work for another surety for the term of fourteen months and seventeen days. In the case against Broughton, Fields was fined $50 and $69.70 costs. Under the law he might have been condemned to hard labor for less than four months. By the contract described, he was required to work for Broughton for a period of nineteen months and twenty-nine days.\n We are cited to a series of Alabama cases, in which it is \n\n[235 U.S. 133, 148]\n\u00a0\n held that the confessed judgment and the contract do not satisfy the law nor pay the penalty imposed, but the hirer becomes the transferee of the right of the state to compel the payment of the fine and costs, and by this exaction of involuntary servitude the convict has only changed masters, and that under the Alabama Constitution the law is constitutional, and that the convict is not being imprisoned for indebtedness. It is to be observed that the same learned court, in one of its later deliverances ( State v. Etowah Lumber Co. 153 Ala. 77, 78, 45 So. 162), has said, in speaking of this contract, 'the state was in no sense a party to the contract by which the company acquired the custody of Falkner [the convict in that case]. It is true it [the state] permitted the making of the contract, and provides a punishment for its breach.' Here is a direct utterance of that court that the state was not a party to the surety's agreement, but its connection with it was to permit it, and provide the punishment for its breach.\n True it is that this court follows the decisions of the state courts, in determining the constitutionality of its statutes under the Constitutions of the states; and in considering the constitutionality of statutes ordinarily accepts their meaning as construed by the state courts. The Alabama decisions, to which we have been referred, are, more strictly speaking, determinations of the legal effect of these statutes than interpretation of any doubtful meaning which may be found within their terms. Moreover, we are here dealing with a case which involves the Constitution and statutes of the United States, as to which this court, by force of the Constitution, and the several judiciary acts which have been enacted by Congress, is the ultimate arbiter. In such cases this court must determine for itself whether a given enactment violates the Constitution of the United States or the statutes passed in pursuance thereof. The validity of this system of state law must be judged by its operation and effect upon rights \n\n[235 U.S. 133, 149]\n\u00a0\n secured by the Constitution of the United States and offenses punished by the Federal statutes. If such state statutes, upon their face, or in the manner of their administration, have the effect to deny rights secured by the Federal Constitution, or to nullify statutes passed in pursuance thereto, they must fail. Bailey v. Alabama, supra; Henderson v. New York ( Henderson v. Wickham) \n92 U.S. 268\n, 23 L. ed. 547.\n Nor do we think this case is controlled by Freeman v. United States, \n217 U.S. 539\n, 54 L. ed. 874, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 592, 19 Ann. Cas. 755, cited by counsel for defendants in error. In that case it was held that a money penalty imposed for embezzlement which went to the creditor, and not into the Treasury, under the Penal Code of the Philippine Islands, did not make imprisonment for the nonpayment of such penalty equivalent to imprisonment for debt. In that case, although the penalty affixed went to the creditor, it was part of the sentence imposed by the law as a punishment for the crime. In the present case, the contract under which the convict serves for the surety is made between the parties concerned, who determine and fix its terms, and is not fixed by the state as the punishment for the commission of an offense.\n There can be no doubt that the state has authority to impose involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime. This fact is recognized in the 13th Amendment, and such punishment expressly excepted from its terms. Of course, the state may impose fines and penalties which must be worked out for the benefit of the state, and in such manner as the state may legitimately prescribe. See Clyatt v. United States, \n197 U.S. 207\n, 49 L. ed. 726, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 429, and Bailey v. Alabama, \n219 U.S. 219\n, 55 L. ed. 191, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 145. But here the state has taken the obligation of another for the fine and costs, imposed upon one convicted for the violation of the laws of the state. It has accepted the obligation of the surety, and, in the present case, it is recited in the record that the money has been if fact paid by the surety. The surety and convict have made a new contract for service, in regard to the terms of which the \n\n[235 U.S. 133, 150]\n\u00a0\n state has not been consulted. The convict must work it out to satisfy the surety for whom he has contracted to work. This contract must be kept, under pain of rearrest, and another similar proceeding for its violation, and perhaps another and another. Thus, under pain of recurring prosecutions, the convict may be kept at labor, to satisfy the demands of his employer.\n In our opinion, this system is in violation of rights intended to be secured by the 13th Amendment, as well as in violation of the statutes to which we have referred, which the Congress has enacted for the purpose of making that Amendment effective.\n It follows that the judgment of the District Court must be reversed. Judgment accordingly.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes, concurring:\n There seems to me nothing in the 13th Amendment or the Revised Statutes that prevents a state from making a breach of contract, as well a reasonable contract for labor as for other matters, a crime and punishing it as such. But impulsive people with little intelligence or foresight may be expected to lay hold of anything that affords a relief from present pain, even though it will cause greater trouble by and by. The successive contracts, each for a longer term than the last, are the inevitable, and must be taken to have been the contemplated, outcome of the Alabama laws. On this ground I am inclined to agree that the statutes in question disclosed the attempt to maintain service that the Revised Statutes forbid. \n\n\n\n","260":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU. S. v. UNITED ENGINEERING & CONSTRUCTING CO.(1914)\nNo. 381\nArgued: Decided: June 8, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 236, 237]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Thompson and Mr. P. M. Ashford for appellant.\n Messrs. Frederic D. McKenney, John S. Flannery, and William Hitz for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n Suit was brought in the court of claims by the United Engineering & Contracting Company to recover of the United States upon a contract, dated the 15th of September, 1900, for the construction within seven calendar months from the date of the contract, namely, by April 15, 1901, of a pumping plant for Dry Dock No. 3 at the New York Navy Yards, the work to be done in accordance with certain plans and specifications annexed to and forming a part of the contract. The claimant recovered a judgment (47 Ct. Cl. 489), and the United States brings this appeal.\n The principal question in the case involves the correctness of that part of the judgment of the court of claims which permitted the claimant to recover $6,000, which the government had deducted as liquidated damages for 240 days' delay in the completion of the work, at the rate of $25 per day. To understand this question the terms of the contract and certain facts found by the court of claims, upon which the case is to be considered here, must be had in view.\n The claimant commenced the construction of the work in accordance with the contract, and after a portion thereof had been done the Navy Department concluded to connect Dry Dock No. 2 with Dry Dock No. 3, and to build a single pumping plant for both docks. To that end, on July 21, \n\n[234 U.S. 236, 238]\n\u00a0\n 1901, a supplemental contract was entered into with the United States, whereby the claimant agreed, for an additional sum, to furnish all the material and labor necessary to carry out the changes in and additions to the plant originally contracted for, and to complete the work on or before October 15, 1901, to which date the original contract was extended.\n While the work was progressing under the original and supplemental contracts, a controversy arose between the claimant and the civil engineer in charge as to the proper method of designing and constructing the floor of the pump well, and as to the correct interpretation of the requirements of the specifications concerning other matters, which resulted in considerable delay and the cessation of work without the fault of the claimant. On January 13, 1903, the chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks appointed a board to consider changes in the bottom of the pump well, and the compensation to be paid therefor, of which the claimant was advised by letter, and it was informed that it would be expected to immediately resume work under its contract, and push the same to completion with utmost despatch, otherwise the Bureau would annul the contract and take over the entire work. The claimant thereupon promised to push the work to completion as rapidly as possible, with which promise the Bureau appears to have been satisfied.\n On February 15, 1903, after the date fixed for the completion of the work under the original and supplemental contracts, a second supplemental contract was entered into, whereby the claimant agreed to construct three hatches in the roof of the pump well for additional compensation. Nothing was said in this contract as to the time of completion, or as to delays under prior contracts.\n The board of officers appointed to consider the design of the floor of the pump well and other matters in controversy reported February 16, 1903, that there were, as \n\n[234 U.S. 236, 239]\n\u00a0\n conceded by the Bureau, errors in the design of the pump well floor; that the work done and materials furnished by the claimant complied with the specifications, and that it was not chargeable with improper work or procedure, and the board estimated the increased compensation for the new work, and made certain allowances to the claimant. On March 7, 1903, a third supplemental contract was entered into, which embodied the changes found necessary in the original plan for the construction of the floor of the pump well, and the increased compensation to claimant therefor. Nothing was said in this contract as to the date of the completion of the work theretofore contracted for, nor as to prior delays.\n The claimant proceeded under the contracts with reasonable despatch and without delay on its part until May 1, 1903, when the work was ready for the installation of the machinery. Up to this date the claimant was delayed by the government in making changes and alterations in the work, and in the use of the docks for docking vessels while the work was going forward. No delays were chargeable to the claimant up to October 15, 1901, the time fixed for the completion of the work, nor thereafter to May 1, 1903. During this period, due to the delays of the government, the claimant incurred additional expenses for superintendence and maintenance. During the period from May 1, 1903, to April 21, 1904, the work was delayed by the claimant's subcontractors in not getting the pump castings in place, for which the government was not responsible. The claimant was also delayed for a few days during said period by the government while using the docks for docking vessels.\n At the request of the Bureau a civil engineer made a review of the matter of delays, and in February, 1905, reported that, notwithstanding the increased work required by the supplemental agreements and the restrictions placed upon the work, the claimant was up to time \n\n[234 U.S. 236, 240]\n\u00a0\n on its contracts to May 1, 1903, but that subsequent to that date, and up to April 21, 1904, it had taken seven calendar months' more time than was necessary. After the plant was completed a board was appointed to pass upon it, which recommended certain deductions from the contract price for failure to strictly comply with the specifications. On March 24, 1905, the civil engineer in charge transmitted to the claimant a supplemental agreement covering the deductions, which agreement contained a reservation that nothing therein and no action taken under it should affect the rights of either party in the matter of delay and the completion of the work, or otherwise, except as specifically stated, which supplemental agreement claimant refused to execute. In February, 1906, long after the plant had been accepted, the Bureau held the claimant responsible for 240 days' delay at the rate of $25 per day, or $6000, as liquidated damages, and deducted the same from the balance due under the contract, which the claimant accepted under protest, and it subsequently filed with the Bureau a written protest against the deductions for delays and disallowances. The work was completed and accepted finally by the government on April 5, 1905\n\n\n Notwithstanding the delays of the government, the court of claims found that the claimant, with reasonable diligence, could have completed the plant for tests during the period by about September 21, 1903, and found that if it was chargeable for the delay according to the liquidated damage clause of paragraph 12 of the specifications of $25 per day, the deduction would be $750 less than the government had deducted. But it found that, if the claimant was only liable for actual damages, and it did so determine, since there was no evidence as to such damages, the claimant was entitled to recover the entire amount deducted.\n In the original contract the specifications provided \n\n[234 U.S. 236, 241]\n\u00a0\n paragraph 12, for liquidated damages for delay, as follows:\n'12. Damages for delay.-In case the work is not completed within the time specified in the contract, or the time allowed by the Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks under paragraph 11 of this specification, it is distinctly understood and agreed that deductions at the rate of $25 per day shall be made from the contract price for each and every calendar day after and exclusive of the date within which completion was required up to and including the date of completion and acceptance of the work, said sum being specifically agreed upon as the measure of damage to the United States by reason of delay in the completion of the work; and the contractor shall agree and consent that the contract price, reduced by the aggregate of damages so deducted, shall be accepted in full satisfaction for all work done under the contract.'\n\n Under the provisions of this paragraph, if there had been nothing subsequently changing the rights of the parties, and the delay had resulted from the failure of the claimant to complete the work within the time specified, the deduction at the rate of $25 per day might have been made by the United States as liquidated damages. This was the sum estimated and agreed upon between the parties as the damages which might be regarded as sustained by the government in event of the breach of the claimant's obligation to complete the work within the stipulated time. Such contracts for liquidated damages, when reasonable in their character, are not to be regarded as penalties, and may be enforced between the parties. See Sun Printing & Pub. Asso. v. Moore, \n183 U.S. 642\n, 46 L. ed. 366, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 240, in which the matter is fully discussed.\n The precise question here is whether, when the work was delayed solely because of the government's fault beyond the time fixed for its completion, and afterwards the work was completed without any definite time being fixed in \n\n[234 U.S. 236, 242]\n\u00a0\n which it was to be done, the claimant can be charged for the subsequent delays for which he was at fault by the rule of the original contract, stipulating liquidated damages, or was that stipulation waived by the conduct of the government, and was it obligatory upon it, in order to recover for the subsequent delays, to show the actual damages sustained. We think the better rule is that when the contractor has agreed to do a piece of work within a given time, and the parties have stipulated fixed sum as liquidated damages, not wholly disproportionate to the loss for each day's delay, in order to enforce such payment the other party must not prevent the performance of the contract within the stipulated time; and that where such is the case, and thereafter the work is completed, though delayed by the fault of the contractor, the rule of the original contract cannot be insisted upon, and liquidated damages measured thereby are waived. Under the original and first supplemental agreements, the claimant knew definitely that he was required to complete the work by a fixed date. Presumably the claimant had made its arrangements for completion within the time named. Certainly the other contracting party ought not to be permitted to insist upon liquidated damages when it is responsible for the failure to complete by the stipulated date; to do this would permit it to recover damages for delay caused by its own conduct.\n It may be that damages were sustained by the failure to carry out the subsequent agreement. But the government, as well as the claimant, saw fit to go on with the work with no fixed rule for the time of its completion, so that it be reasonable, and the government required no stipulation in the second and third supplemental contracts as to damages in a fixed and definite sum for failure to complete the work as required. Under such circumstances we think it must be content to recover such damages as it is able to prove were actually suffered. \n\n[234 U.S. 236, 243]\n\u00a0\n This conclusion is in accord with the rule of the English cases. In Dodd v. Churton, \n\n[234 U.S. 236, 1897]\n\u00a0\n 1 Q. B. 562, Chitty, L. J., said:\n'The law on the subject is well settled. The case of Holme v. Guppy, 3 Mees. & W. 387, 1 Jur. 825, and the subsequent cases in which that decision has been followed, are merely examples of the well-known principle stated in Comyns's Digest, Condition L, (6), that, where performance of a condition has been rendered impossible by the act of the grantee himself, the grantor is exonerated from performance of it. The law on the subject was very neatly put by Byles, J., in Russell v. Bandeira, 13 C. B. N. S. 149, 32 L. J. C. P. N. S. 68, 9 Jur. N. S. 718, 7 L. T. N. S. 804. This principle is applicable not to building contracts only, but to all contracts. If a man agrees to do something by a particular day, or, in default, to pay a sum of money as liquidated damages, the other party to the contract must not do anything to prevent him from doing the thing contracted for within the specified time.'\n\n The same rule was followed with approval by the New York Court of Appeals in a well-considered case, Mosler Safe Co. v. Maiden Lane S. D. Co. 199 N. Y. 479, 37 L.R.A.(N.S.) 363, 93 N. E. 81, in which it was held that, even where both parties are responsible for the delays beyond the fixed time, the obligation for liquidated damages is annulled, and, in the absence of a provision substituting another date, it cannot be revived, and the recovery for subsequent delays must be for actual loss proved to have been sustained.\n This principle is applicable here; the conduct of the government's agents had caused the delays up to May 1, 1913, and the subsequent delays, though chargeable to the claimant, would only give rise to a claim for damages measured by the actual loss sustained. Mosler Safe Co. v. Maiden Lane S. D. Co. supra. We think the application of this rule is not changed by the difficulty suggested, that it might be impracticable to prove actual damages. This fact, if such it be, would not permit the government \n\n[234 U.S. 236, 244]\n\u00a0\n by its own fault to prevent the performance of the contract, and to do that which amounts to a waiver of the stipulation, and then insist upon it as a rule of damages. We think the court of claims was right upon this principal branch of the case.\n There are certain minor assignments of error to the conclusions and judgment of the court of claims. The government was held responsible for the extra cost of enclosing certain machinery in casing necessitated by its building a plank walk across the top of the pipe in the pumping plant to protect its workmen from high speed gearing. The court of claims found that this expense was made necessary by the government, and allowed for it. We find no error in this. Also, as to the assignment of error to the judgment of the court of claims under finding 11, awarding damages for repairs made necessary by the breakage of certain pipes, caused by sudden increase in the pressure in the salt and fresh water systems in the Navy Yard, the court of claims found that these breaks were caused by the government without notice to the claimant, and without its fault. We find no error in the judgment of the court of claims awarding damages under this finding.\n It follows that the judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","261":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. BARTLETT(1914)\nNo. 251\nArgued: October 22, 1914Decided: November 16, 1914\n\n\n\n Assistant Attorney General Knaebel and Mr. S. W. Williams for appellant.\n\n\n[235 U.S. 72, 75]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George S. Ramsey and Edgar A. De Meules for appellees.\n\n\n[235 U.S. 72, 78]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This is a suit to cancel two deeds of land allotted to an enrolled citizen of the Creek tribe of Indians. The land is what is known as surplus, as distinguished from homestead, land, and the allottee is of three fourths Indian blood. The allotment was made under the act of June 30, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 500, chap. 1323), known as the Supplemental Creek Agreement, which provided in 16 that the land should be inalienable by the allottee or his heirs for a period of five years, expiring, as it is said in the briefs, August 8, 1907. In 1912 the allottee deeded the land to Bartlett, one of the appellees, and shortly thereafter Bartlett deeded it to Lashley, the other appellee. These are the deeds sought to be canceled, and the right to that relief is rested upon a provision in  1 of the act of May 27, 1908 (35 Stat. at L. 312, chap. 199), declaring that 'all allotted lands of . . . enrolled mixed-bloods of three quarters or more Indian blood . . . shall not be subject to alienation, contract to sell, power of attorney, or any other encumbrance prior to April twenty- sixth, nineteen hundred and thirty-one,' etc. As the original restriction upon alienation expired several months before the passage of the act of 1908, and also long before the deed from the allottee to Bartlett, the important question in the case is whether Congress intended by the act of 1908 to re- \n\n[235 U.S. 72, 79]\n\u00a0\n impose and extend that restriction in respect of allotments which theretofore had been entirely freed from it through the expiration of the period prescribed for its existence. The district court, adhering to an opinion given in another case (United States v. Shock, 187 Fed. 870, 873), answered the question in the affirmative, and the circuit court of appeals, concluding that the answer should be the other way, directed that the bill be dismissed. 121 C. C. A. 520, 203 Fed. 410.\n If taken literally, the language which we have quoted from the act of 1908 is doubtless broad enough to embrace all allotments of the class described, whether then subject to the original restriction or theretofore freed from it. But that language is not to be taken literally, for it is followed by a declaration that 'nothing herein shall be construed to impose restrictions removed from land by or under any law prior to the passage of this act.' That this declaration is intended to qualify or restrain what precedes it is conceded, but to what extent is the subject of opposing contentions.\n Under prior legislation the lands of the Five Civilized Tribes, including those of the Creeks, had been allotted in severalty, all subject to restrictions upon alienation which were to be terminated by the lapse of varying periods of time. As to some of the lands these periods had expired, thereby lifting the restrictions. In some instances Congress had abrogated the restrictions in advance of the time fixed for their termination, and in still other instances they had been canceled by the Secretary of the Interior in the exercise of authority conferred by law. But as to most of the lands the restrictions were still in force. It was in this situation that Congress, by the act of 1908, extended or enlarged the period of restriction in respect of 'all allotted lands of . . . enrolled mixed-bloods of three quarters or more Indian blood,' and accompanied its action with an explanation that it was not intended to \n\n[235 U.S. 72, 80]\n\u00a0\n impose restrictions theretofore 'removed from any land by or under any law.'\n The real controversy is over the meaning of the word 'removed.' It is not questioned that it embraces the action of Congress and of the Secretary of the Interior in abrogating or canceling restrictions in advance of the time fixed for their expiration, but it is insisted that it does not embrace their termination by the lapse of time. In short, the contention is that the word is used in a sense which comprehends only an affirmative act, such as a rescission or revocation while the statutory period was still running. Although having support in some definitions of the word, the contention is, in our opinion, untenable, for other parts of the same act, as also other acts dealing with the same subject, show that the word is employed in this legislation in a broad sense plainly including a termination of the restrictions through the expiration of the prescribed period. This is illustrated in  4 and 5 of the act of 1908, and  19 of the act of April 26, 1906 (34 Stat. at L. 137, chap. 1876), and is recognized in Choate v. Trappe \n224 \nU.S. 665, 673\n, 56 S. L. ed. 941, 945, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 565, where, in dealing with some of these allotments, it was said that 'restrictions on alienation were removed by lapse of time.'\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","262":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. BUFFALO PITTS CO.(1914)\nNo. 369\nArgued: Decided: June 8, 1914\n\n\n\n Assistant Attorney General Underwood for plaintiff in error. \n\n[234 U.S. 228, 229]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward Payson White for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n This suit was brought by the Buffalo Pitts Company in the circuit court of the United States for the western district of New York to recover for the value of the use of a certain engine which it was alleged the United States was under an implied contract to pay. The action was begun under the Tucker act of March 3, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 505, chap. 359, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 752), and the court of original jurisdiction, as required by the statute,  7, made findings of fact and conclusions of law under which it held the government liable and rendered judgment for the plaintiff's claim. On writ of error the circuit court of appeals affirmed that judgment (114 C. C. A. 119, 193 Fed. 905), and the case is brought here.\n The findings of fact show that: The plaintiff is a corporation organized under the laws of New York, and having its principal place of business at Buffalo, New York, manufacturing, among other things, traction engines. On May 20, 1905, it sold a traction engine with appurtenances to the Taylor-Moore Construction Company, delivered \n\n[234 U.S. 228, 230]\n\u00a0\n at Roswell, New Mexico, and took a chattel mortgage thereon to secure the payment of $1,600 of the purchase price. The chattel mortgage conveyed the engine and appurtenances to the plaintiff on condition that if the mortgagor should fail to pay the sum of $1,600 according to certain notes, or should attempt to dispose of or injure the property, or remove the same from the county of Chaves, New Mexico, or if the mortgagor should not take proper care of the property, or if the mortgagee should at any time deem itself unsafe or insecure, then the whole amount unpaid should be considered immediately due and payable, and it should be lawful for the mortgagee to take the property and remove the same, and hold or sell it and all equity of redemption at public auction, with notice as provided by law. The mortgage was duly recorded May 22, 1905, and no part of the money thereby secured has ever been paid to the mortgagee, which has ever since been the owner and holder of the mortgage. The engine was put to work by the construction company upon the socalled Hondo Project, being part of the Reclamation Service undertaken by the Department of the Interior of the United States, which work was being prosecuted under a contract between the United States and the construction company, the engine being located at or near Roswell, New Mexico.\n The construction company having made default in the performance of its contract, on or about June 7, 1905, work was suspended thereunder, and the construction company then assigned all its interest in the contract to the United States, which, pursuant to the contract, took possession of all material, supplies, and equipment belonging to the construction company, including the engine and appurtenances. On June 16, 1905, at Roswell, New Mexico, the plaintiff, by its agents, made a demand upon the defendant through Wendell M. Reed, District Engineer of the Reclamation Service under the Department of the Interior, \n\n[234 U.S. 228, 231]\n\u00a0\n for the possession of the engine and appurtenances, which the defendant then and there refused, and thereafter it retained and used the property in the work under the contract until June 21, 1906. Reed was during, and before, and after, such period, the local representative of the government in charge of the work under the contract at and near Roswell, and as such took possession of the engine and appurtenances for the United States. Thereafter the defendant, by the Director of the United States Geological Survey, to whom the Secretary of the Interior referred the matter, and by the Chief Engineer and Assistant Chief Engineer of the Reclamation Service, under the direction of the Department, ratified and adopted the acts of Reed in respect to the possession of the engine and appurtenances. The mortgagor has never made any claim to the property since the suspension and assignment of the contract to the defendant.\n Plaintiff, on or about June 16, 1905, and also on or about September 30, 1905, notified the defendant of the execution and filing of the chattel mortgage, and that the plaintiff claimed the property under the title thereby vested in it, and claimed the right of possession because of the default by the mortgagor in the conditions thereof, and the defendant at all times well knew of the existence and filing of the chattel mortgage, and did not at any time dispute the validity thereof. On September 30, 1905, the defendant represented to the plaintiff that it was using and would continue to use the engine and appurtenances in its work, and that any legal proceedings to recover the possession thereof would be resisted by the defendant, and further represented to the plaintiff that if such property was left in the defendant's possession, its attorney would recommend payment therefor. The plaintiff relied upon the fact that its title to the property under the chattel mortgage was not disputed by the defendant, and upon the representations made to it as aforesaid, and consented \n\n[234 U.S. 228, 232]\n\u00a0\n to defendant's retaining possession of the property in expectation of receiving due compensation therefor.\n The question in this case is, did these facts warrant the deduction that the government was liable upon an implied contract to pay for the use of the engine? In cases brought under this act coming up from a district or circuit court of the United States, the findings of fact of the trial court are conclusive, and the question is whether the conclusions of law were warranted by the facts found (Chase v. United States, \n155 \nU.S. 489, 500\n, 39 S. L. ed. 234, 238, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 174). Exceptions to the rule may exist if the record enables the court to conclude that the ultimate facts found are not supported by any evidence whatever (Collier v. United States, \n173 U.S. 79\n, 43 L. ed. 621, 19 Sup. Ct. Rep. 330).\n We think the circuit court and the circuit court of appeals were right in concluding that, under the facts found the United States was liable upon an implied contract. As to the plaintiff, it is specifically found that it left the property with the defendant, relying upon the fact that its title to the property under the mortgage was not disputed, and upon the representations made to it, and consented to the defendant's retaining possession of the property in expectation of receiving compensation for it; as to the government, it is found that it was well known to it that the chattel mortgage existed, and its validity was undisputed, and that it would continue the use of the engine and appurtenances, and, if left in its possession, payment would be recommended for such use.\n True it is that under the Tucker act there is no jurisdiction in the court of claims or district courts of the United States to recover for acts merely tortious, the statute providing that there shall be no recovery except in cases not sounding in tort. It has been said in the case cited for the government, Harley v. United States, \n198 U.S. 229\n, 49 L. ed. 1029, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 634, that there must be some meeting of the minds of the parties upon the fact that compensation will be made. In \n\n[234 U.S. 228, 233]\n\u00a0\n that case it was found that there was no demand based upon a convention between the parties, or coming together of minds, for while the plaintiff, an employee of the government in the Bureau of Printing and Engraving, supposed and understood he would be entitled to compensation for certain improvements made in printing presses which were used for many years by the Bureau, the findings also set forth in express terms that it was supposed and understood by the officers of the government that the claimant would neither expect nor demand remuneration, and this fact, said this court, distinguished it from McKeever v. United States, 14 Ct. Cl. 396, affirmed by this court; also from United States v. Lynah, \n188 U.S. 445\n, 47 L. ed. 539, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 349, and the other cases cited by appellant.\n In the present case, as we have said, there is nothing to show that the government expected to use the engine and appurtenances without compensation. It did not dispute the mortgage, and the findings of fact clearly show that if the government had the right to take the property, notwithstanding the mortgage interest which the plaintiff had in it, it made no claim of right to take and use it without compensation as against the prior outstanding mortgage, which distinctly reserved the right to take and sell the property under the circumstances shown, and which, after the breach of condition, vested the right of possession and the right to convert the property in the mortgagee. Kitchen v. Schuster, 14 N. M. 164, 89 Pac. 261.\n Furthermore, the government was authorized by  7 of the act of June 17, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 388, chap. 1093, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 662), under which this improvement was being made, to acquire any property necessary for the purpose, and, if need be, to appropriate it. It may be said, as contended, that under the contract with the construction company the government had a right to take possession of this engine, which was in possession of the company as mortgagor, and by virtue of the terms of the agreement complete the work, but it could not in this \n\n[234 U.S. 228, 234]\n\u00a0\n manner extinguish the rights of the mortgagee, nor did it undertake to do so. Under such circumstances we think the former decisions of this court, recognizing the general principles of justice which give rise to implied obligations, and enforcing the right of compensation when private property is taken for a public use, require the government to make compensation for the use of this engine, and that the facts bring this case within United States v. Great Falls Mfg. Co. \n112 U.S. 645\n, 28 L. ed. 846, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 306, and United States v. Lynah, supra. In the latter case, where it was sought to recover damages for the alleged taking of the plaintiff's property in the construction of a dam which had the effect to overflow lands belonging to him, and destroy their value, after an extended review of the previous cases in this court, it was said (p. 464):\n'The rule deducible from these cases is that when the government appropriates property which it does not claim as its own, it does so under an implied contract that it will pay the value of the property it so appropriates. It is earnestly contended in argument that the government had a right to appropriate this property. This may be conceded, but there is a vast difference between a proprietary and a governmental right. When the government owns property, or claims to own it, it deals with it as owner and by virtue of its ownership, and if an officer of the government takes possession of property under the claim that it belongs to the government (when in fact it does not), that may well be considered a tortious act on his part, for there can be no implication of an intent on the part of the government to pay for that which it claims to own. Very different from this proprietary right of the government in respect to property which it owns is its governmental right to appropriate the property of individuals. All private property is held subject to the necessities of government. The right of eminent domain underlies all such rights of property. The government may take personal or real \n\n[234 U.S. 228, 235]\n\u00a0\n property whenever its necessities or the exigencies of the occasion demand. So the contention that the government had a paramount right to appropriate this property may be conceded, but the Constitution, in the 5th Amendment, guarantees that when this governmental right of appropriation-this asserted paramount right-is exercised, it shall be attended by compensation.\n\n'. . . Whenever, in the exercise of its governmental rights, it takes property, the ownership of which it concedes to be in an individual, it impliedly promises to pay therefor. Such is the import of the cases cited as well as of many others.'\n\n In Hooe v. United States, \n218 U.S. 322\n, 54 L. ed. 1055, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 85, the attempt to make the government liable for rent was in the face of a statute of the United States which provided that no contract should be made for rent until an appropriation for that purpose had been made by Congress. In the present case, the government had the right to contract for this work under statutory authority, and to acquire property necessary to that end. Under the contract it might take possession of the construction company's property, and, it may be conceded, finish the contract with such property, but it had no right to use the property of others without compensation, and in this case it did not assume to do so. The mortgagee had a distinct right in the property, which had accrued to it before the property was entered upon, and was authorized to take and hold the same as against the attempted transfer of the mortgagor. While the government claimed the right to thus take and use the property, it nevertheless held it without denying the right of the owner to compensation. When it takes property under such circumstances for an authorized governmental use, it impliedly promises to pay therefor. This accords with the principles declared in the previous cases in this court, and arises because of the Constitutional obligation embodied in the 5th Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n\n[234 U.S. 228, 236]\n\u00a0\n States, guarantying the owner of property against its appropriation for a governmental use without compensation.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and it is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","263":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. FOSTER(1914)\nNo. 838\nArgued: Decided: May 4, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 515, 516]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Wallace for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Philip Rubenstein and Timothy Howard for defendants in error.\n\n\n\n[233 U.S. 515, 518]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Indictment in two counts for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and to violate certain provisions of the postal laws. The object of the conspiracy and the manner of its execution are in substance, as charged in the indictment in the first count, as follows: Harold A. Foster was postmaster of the United States postoffice at North Brookfield, Massachusetts, a second-class office. The salary of the office was fixed by the Postmaster General, pursuant to law and the regulations established by him, at $2,000 a year, the salary being based and ascertained upon the gross receipts of the office for the twelve months next preceding the 31st of March, 1911. The law required the salary to be adjusted annually, and the next adjustment was required to be made by the Postmaster General in accordance with the gross receipts of the office as shown by the quarterly returns of the postmaster to the Auditor of the Postoffice Department for the four quarters next preceding the 31st of March, 1912, the readjustment to take effect on the ensuing 1st of July, 1912. The Postmaster General was required by law and the established regulations in readjusting such salary not to include in the gross receipts of the office the moneys received by the postmaster for the sale of stamps to any person or persons in large quantities, to be used in other \n\n[233 U.S. 515, 519]\n\u00a0\n postoffices than the North Brookfield office for mailing purposes, or in that office if such matter in the ordinary course would not be deposited for mailing in the latter office.\n Frank E. Winchell, of North Brookfield, was the president and general manager of the Oxford Linen Mills, a corporation having its usual place of business at North Brookfield, and William S. Edwards and Harry H. Platt, both of New York, were officers of the Sterling Debenture Company, a corporation having its place of business in New York, and they and Foster, well knowing the premises, conspired to defraud the United States of its money and property by Winchell purchasing from the United States in behalf of the Oxford Linen Mills, with the knowledge, consent, and connivance of Foster, quantities of United States postage stamps to be sent to the Sterling Debenture corporation at New York, and Edwards and Platt as its officers were to cause it to use them in the prepayment of postage upon matter to be deposited in the postoffice in New York or in some other office, with the view and intent, by means of the purchase of stamps as stated, of irregularly and improperly increasing the gross receipts of the North Brookfield postoffice for the twelve months beginning on the 1st of April, 1911, and ending on the 31st of March, 1912, and thereby enabling Foster, as such postmaster to make returns to the Auditor of the Postoffice Department as a basis for the adjustment of Foster's salary for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1912, which returns should include the sale of stamps so made to Winchell in addition to the sale of stamps made by Foster to other persons in the regular business of the North Brookfield office, with the intent and view of violating the regulations of the Postoffice Department, and for the purpose of fraudulently increasing Foster's salary, and with the further intent that such sales should, in violation of the Postoffice regulations, be included and \n\n[233 U.S. 515, 520]\n\u00a0\n deemed a part of the gross receipts of the North Brookfield office for the period above mentioned, and be made in part the basis of the readjustment of Foster's salary. All the acts done by Foster, Winchell, Edwards, and Platt were done knowingly, wilfully, and fraudulently for such purpose; that is, for the purpose of increasing the salary of Foster by a sum of money in excess of that which he would be lawfully entitled to receive, and to cause such excessive sum to be paid to him, and thereby cheat and defraud the United States thereof.\n In pursuance of the unlawful conspiracy, and to effect its object, on the 1st of July, 1911, Foster, as such postmaster, made a false return to the Postoffice Department of the gross receipts of the North Brookfield office for the quarter ending June 30, 1911\n\n\n In further pursuance of the conspiracy, and to effect its object, Winchell, on June 2, 1911, at North Brookfield, sent by registered mail to the Sterling Debenture corporation at New York a certain package, and also in pursuance of the conspiracy, and to effect its object, Winchell bought from Foster postage stamps to the value of $200.\n In a second count the indictment charges that the defendants unlawfully conspired to commit an offense against the United States, specified to be an offense denounced by  206 of the act of March 4, 1909, entitled, 'An Act to Codify, Revise, and Amend the Penal Laws of the United States' [35 Stat. at L. 1128, chap. 321, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1649], in that Foster, as such postmaster, should, in violation of the section, knowingly and fraudulently increase Foster's salary and compensation by knowingly and fraudulently failing to report, in the report or the gross receipts of his office required by law and the regulations of the Postoffice Department, large and irregular sales of stamps to be made by Foster to Winchell as president and general manager of the Oxford Linen Mills, not to be used by that corporation, or by Winchell, or by any other person for \n\n[233 U.S. 515, 521]\n\u00a0\n the mailing of matter at the North Brookfield office, but to be used for mailing matter at New York or in some other office other than the North Brookfield office, with the intent and for the purpose of increasing the compensation of Foster as such postmaster. That in pursuance of such conspiracy Winchell, on June 2, 1911, purchased stamps of the value of $ 200.\n In pursuance of the conspiracy and to effect its object, Foster, on the 1st of July, 1911, made a false return to the Auditor of the Postoffice Department of the gross receipts of his office. An overt act by Winchell is charged.\n The defendants were duly arraigned and pleaded not guilty, but subsequently withdrew their pleas of not guilty and filed demurrers to the indictment.\n The grounds of demurrer were the same as to both counts, and were: (1) The facts alleged did not constitute a crime; (2) nor an offense at common law; (3) nor a violation of the statutes or penal laws of the United States; (4) nor a violation of any valid regulation of the Postmaster General; (5) each and every one of his regulations is invalid.\n The demurrers to the first count were sustained on the ground expressed by the court in its opinion, that the act of March 3, 1883 (22 Stat. at L. 600, chap. 142, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2619), provides that the salaries of postmasters of the second class shall be determined by the gross receipts of the office, and that the Postmaster General had no power to qualify the requirement of the law by providing that unusual sales of stamps should not be included in estimating the gross receipts.\n In passing upon the demurrers to the second count the court said that the count charged the defendants with a conspiracy to commit 'the offense denounced by  206 of the Criminal Code,' that section providing, inter alia, that whoever, being a postmaster, shall, for the purpose of fraudulently increasing his compensation, make a false return, statement, or account to any officer of the \n\n[233 U.S. 515, 522]\n\u00a0\n United States, shall be punished. The crime denounced, the court said, included 'two essential elements: (1) that a return shall be made, which was known to be false; and (2) that such false return shall have been made 'for the purpose of fraudulently increasing compensation.\" And the court observed that there could be no criminality unless a false return was made for the purpose stated, and that it appearing from the indictment that the alleged return made by Foster was to secure for him only what he was legally entitled to receive, he committed no crime under  206, 'and the alleged conspiracy to do so was not a conspiracy to commit the offense denounced thereby.'\n It will be observed, therefore, that the court held that the indictment charged neither a conspiracy to defraud the United States nor to make a false return, because the object of each conspiracy was to obtain only what Foster was legally entitled to; namely, an increase of salary based upon the gross receipts of his office, and that it was immaterial how they were increased or for what purpose increased.\n The case was brought here under the criminal appeals act, its provision being that this court has jurisdiction on writ of error taken by the United States in criminal cases 'from a decision sustaining a demurrer to any indictment where such decision is based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded.' It is, however, contended by defendants in error that this court has no jurisdiction because, it is further contended, the district court gave the same meaning to the statutes upon which the indictment was based as the government asserted was the correct one, and only decided that the regulation of the Postmaster General was beyond his power to enact under Revised Statutes,  161 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 80), upon which section alone he claimed the power. Nor, it is further contended, were the words 'gross receipts' interpreted. \n\n[233 U.S. 515, 523]\n\u00a0\n 'The only question was,' counsel says, 'whether there was power in an administrative officer to make the regulation limiting its scope.' It is further urged that if those words were interpreted, the indictment was not founded upon the act of 1883, where they occur.\n A lack of jurisdiction is also urged to review the ruling upon the second count, it being based on  206 of the Criminal Code, the construction or interpretation of which was never in dispute. 'Whether it applied or not,' it is said, 'had to be determined by the validity of the regulation.'\n We think the contentions are untenable. The court distinctly ruled that the indictment was in technical or formal details sufficient, and the contention of the parties not only submitted for decision the validity of the regulations of the Postmaster General, but also the sufficiency and legality of the returns made by Foster under the provisions of the statutes. The court, it is true, gave especial prominence to the regulations, but the effect of the statutes independently of the regulations was necessarily considered. In other words, the court must have considered and decided that a conspiracy to establish a basis for a false return for the purpose of increasing Foster's salary was not prohibited by law; and, besides, a construction of the statutes was necessary to determine the validity of the regulation.\n The case being one of statutory construction, a consideration of the statutes becomes necessary.\n It is provided by the act of March 3, 1883, that the 'compensation of postmasters of the first, second and third classes shall be annual salaries, assigned in even hundreds, of dollars, and payable in quarterly payments, to be ascertained and fixed by the Postmaster General from their respective quarterly returns to the Auditor of the Treasury for the Postoffice Department . . . to be forwarded to the First As- \n\n[233 U.S. 515, 524]\n\u00a0\n sistant Postmaster General, for four quarters immediately preceding the adjustment,' according to the gross receipts, the amount of which not only determines the classes, but the compensation of the offices within classes.\n By  4 of the act, the Postmaster General is required to readjust the salaries of the first, second, and third class at the beginning of each fiscal year. The same section fixed the salary of the postmaster at the Washington Postoffice, and provided that 'in no case shall the salary of any postmaster exceed the sum of six thousand dollars, except in the city of New York, where the salary of the postmaster shall remain as now fixed by law, at eight thousand dollars.'\n Section 37 of the Criminal Code makes it an offense to conspire to defraud the United States in any manner or for any purpose.\n Section 206 of the same Code makes it a crime for a postmaster to make a false return, for the purpose of fraudulently increasing his compensation, or to induce or attempt to induce, for such purpose, any person to deposit mail matter in or forward in any manner for mailing at the office where such postmaster is employed, knowing such matter to be properly mailable at some other office.\n Section 208 makes it a crime for a postmaster to dispose of stamps outside of the delivery of his office, or to induce or attempt to induce, for the purpose of increasing his compensation, the purchase of stamps, stamped envelops or postal cards otherwise than as provided by law or the regulations of the Postoffice Department.\n By  161 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 80), it is provided that 'the head of each Department is authorized to prescribe regulations, not inconsistent with law, for the government of his Department, the conduct of its officers and clerks, [and] the distribution and performance of its business. . . .'\n In pursuance of the authority so given, the Postmaster General made the following regulation: \n\n[233 U.S. 515, 525]\n\u00a0\n\n'2. In determining the 'gross receipts' upon which the salary of a postmaster shall be based, stamps, stamped envelops, and postal cards, sold in large or unusual quantities to any person to be used in mailing matter at other postoffices will not be included, whether the sale be made with or without solicitation by the postmaster. When postage stamps or stamped paper are sold in large or unusual quantities, it shall be the duty of the postmaster to inquire into and ascertain whether or not the purchaser intends to use such postage stamps or stamped paper for mailing matter in his office, or other offices; and the fact shall be clearly indicated in his monthly stock report on Form 3240 to the Third Assistant Postmaster General. Upon evidence of neglect of the postmaster to ascertain and report such facts, he will be required to refund the amount of the excess salary and allowances be may have received on account of such sales.'\n\n It is manifest from the quoted provisions that their purpose is to fix the salary of postmasters by the normal receipts of their respective offices, and thereby keep the officers in relation, and to secure such end quarterly returns are required to be made by each postmaster, and each is prohibited under criminal penalty from selling or disposing of stamps, stamped envelops or postal cards outside of the delivery of his office, or selling or disposing of stamps, etc., otherwise than as provided by law or the regulations of the Postoffice Department. In other words, the false returns and designated disposition of stamps are made crimes, and made crimes to secure the purpose of the law to keep the legal measure of the salaries unimpaired and the relation of the offices intact. It may, indeed, be that in one sense the United States would suffer no loss by the derangement of their relation; in another sense the United States would be defrauded. One of the postmasters would fraudulently obtain a greater salary than he was entitled to. But distinctly would the United \n\n[233 U.S. 515, 526]\n\u00a0\n States be defrauded under the facts charged in the indictment, the postmaster at New York having a fixed salary of eight thousand dollars. See in this connection Haas v. Henkel, \n216 \nU.S. 462, 479\n, 54 S. L. ed. 569, 577, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 249, 17 Ann. Cas. 1112.\n The sole theory of the act of 1883 is that every postmaster shall receive a salary dependent upon and regulated by the amount of business done at his office (United States v. Wilson, \n144 \nU.S. 24, 28\n, 36 S. L. ed. 332, 333, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 539) under normal and natural sales of stamps, not unlawfully induced sales. This being the law, what does the indictment charge?\n\n\n (1)\n The salary of the postmaster was to be adjusted in accordance with the returns of the gross receipts. (2) By the law and regulation of the Postmaster General the postmaster was not to include in the gross receipts moneys received from the sale of stamps in large or unusual quantities which were (a) to be used upon matter in some other postoffice, or (b) used upon matter deposited at North Brookfield if, in the ordinary and usual course of business, such matter would be deposited at some other office. (3) The defendants conspired with Winchell, who purchased from Foster with Foster's connivance large quantities of stamps to be used by the Sterling Debenture corporation for mailing matter at New York or some other office than North Brookfield, and by such purchase to irregularly and improperly increase the gross receipts of the North Brookfield office, and thereby enable Foster to make returns as a basis for the readjustment of his salary in violation of the regulations of the Postoffice Department, and for the purpose of increasing his salary, and thereby cheat and defraud the United States.\n The second count charges a violation of  206 of the Criminal Code, by conspiring in the manner we have already set out, and which need not be repeated.\n It is clear from these provisions that it is the gross receipts from lawful sales which are to be the measure of the salary of the postmaster, and that unlawfully induced \n\n[233 U.S. 515, 527]\n\u00a0\n sales ( 208), sales made 'outside of the delivery of the office' (id.), and sales 'otherwise than as provided by law or the regulations of the Postoffice Department' (id.), are unlawful sales and regarded as criminal.\n It would, indeed, be strange if unlawful and criminal sales were intended to constitute a part of the gross receipts upon which the postmaster's salary should be adjusted, and it would seem clear that to prevent such result the Postmaster General could legally exercise by the regulation under review the power given him by  161, Rev. Stat. (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 80). The regulation is purely administrative of the law. (1.) It notifies the postmaster that, in the gross receipts of his office, stamps in large or unsual quantities sold to be used in mailing matter at other postoffices will not be included. This but executes the purpose of the law; adds nothing to it. United States v. Antikamnia Chemical Co. \n231 U.S. 654\n, 58 L. ed.--, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 222; Lewis Pub. Co. v. Wyman, 104 C. C. A. 453, 182 Fed. 13. (2.) It requires the postmaster to ascertain and report the intention of the purchaser of stamps or stamped paper in large or unusual quantities. This is properly supplemental to the first requirement, and a reasonable supervision of the office, and a means of discovering unlawful and fraudulent sales. (3.) It provides that for a neglect to so ascertain and so report the postmaster will be required to refund the amount of the excess salary he may have received on account of such sales. This provision is of doubtful validity, but it is not of material consequence to the questions now involved.\n But if the regulation be regarded as invalid, the indictment yet states an offense. It counts not only upon the regulation, but upon the law; and the facts it alleges show a violation of the law.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","264":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

Upon motion of \n\n[235 U.S. 282, 283]\n\u00a0\n defendants the district court quashed the indictment, basing its decision upon the construction of the statute, and the government has brought this writ of error under the criminal appeals act of March 2, 1907 (34 Stat. at L. chap. 2564, p. 1246 [Comp. St. 1913,  1704]).\n The pertinent portions of the meat inspection law are set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[235 U.S. 282, 284]\n\u00a0\n Pursuant to the authority conferred by it, the Secretary of Agriculture made certain rules and regulations, effective May 1, 1908, among which was the following:\n'An official establishment may ship from the said establishment to any other official establishment any meat \n\n[235 U.S. 282, 285]\n\u00a0\n or meat food product which has been inspected and passed under these regulations without marking the same 'Inspected and passed,' if such shipment be placed in a rail- \n\n[235 U.S. 282, 286]\n\u00a0\n road car which is sealed by an employee of the Bureau of Animal Industry, and provided that not less than 25 per cent of the contents of each car consists of meat or meat food products not marked 'Inspected and passed.\" ( Reg. 25,  12, 1).\n\n The indictment charged, in substance, that defendants knowingly and wrongfully altered, defaced, broke, and destroyed a certain government seal, then being upon a certain railroad freight car containing meat and meat products then under government supervision for inspection and offered for transportation in interstate commerce, the seal having been affixed to the car in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture. The clauses of the statute upon which the indictment rests are those which declare: 'That no person, firm or corporation, or officer, agent, or employee thereof, shall . . . knowingly or wrongfully alter, deface, or destroy . . . any of the marks, stamps, tags, labels, or other identification devices provided for in this act, or in and as directed by the rules and regulations prescribed hereunder by the Secretary of Agriculture, on any carcasses, parts of carcasses, or the food product, or containers thereof, subject to the provisions of this act,' and 'That any person, firm, or corporation, or any officer or agent of any such person, firm, or corporation, who shall violate any of the provisions of this act, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.'\n The district court construed the prohibition as relating alone to those engaged in the business of preparing meats for transportation, and the carrying or assisting in the carrying of such meats in interstate transportation. We are unable to discern any sufficient reason for giving to the language of the statute so limited an application. The plain object of the clause is to safeguard the food products in question against alteration or substitution, and thus enable the officials of the government to sys- \n\n[235 U.S. 282, 287]\n\u00a0\n tematize and render effective the process of inspection; an object that is interfered with if the tags or other identification devices are destroyed, whether they be destroyed by those engaged in the business or by others. Moreover, one of the other prohibitions of the act is in terms limited to those engaged in the interstate commerce of meat or meat food products.\n It seems to us clear that the prohibition upon which the present indictment is founded has an effect as broad as its language, and applies to any and every 'person, firm, or corporation, or officer, agent, or employee thereof.' See United States v. Portale (decided November 2, 1914), \n235 U.S. 27\n, 59 L. ed. --, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1.\n Judgment reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion\n Mr. Justice McReynolds took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That for the purpose of preventing the use in interstate or foreign commerce, as hereinafter provided, of meat and meat food products which are unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, or otherwise unfit for human food, the Secretary of Agriculture . . . shall cause to be made by inspectors appointed for that purpose, as hereinafter provided, a post-mortem examination and inspection of the carcasses and parts thereof of all cattle, sheep, swine, and goats to be prepared for human consumption at any slaughtering, meat-canning, salting, packing, rendering, or similar establishment in any state, territory, or the District of Columbia for transportation or sale as articles of interstate or foreign commerce;

PELICAN(1914)\nNo. 787\nArgued: January 13, 1914Decided: February 24, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 442, 443]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Wallace for plaintiff in error.\n No appearance for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 442, 444]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The defendants were indicted for the murder, on August 30, 1913, of Ed Louie, a full-blood Indian and a member of the Colville tribe. It was charged that the crime was committed 'at a point about 9 miles northwest of the town of Curlew, in the county of Ferry, state of Washington, in the Indian country, to wit, upon the allotment of one Agnes, an Indian, being lot 3 of section 26, and lot 9 of section 35, in township 40 north, or range 32 E. W. M., in the northern division of the eastern district of Washington, said land being then held in trust by the United States for the said Agnes for the period of twenty-five years from the date of the trust patent; to wit, from the 6th day of December, A. D., 1909.'\n The indictment was based upon  2145 of the Revised Statutes, which provides that, save as stated, 'the general laws of the United States as to the punishment of crimes committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, except the District of Columbia, shall extend to the Indian country' (see Rev. Stat.  5339, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3627; Criminal Code, 35 Stat. at L. 1088, chap. 321, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1588,  272, 273, 341).\n A demurrer was filed upon the ground that it did not appear that the crime had been committed within 'the Indian country,' and hence that the court was without jurisdiction. In connection with the hearing upon the demurrer the parties stipulated that the land described in the indictment as the place of the crime had been allotted to the Indian Agnes under the act approved February 8, 1887 [24 Stat. at L. 388, chap. 119], and the act in amendment and extension thereof approved February 28, 1891 [26 Stat. at L. 794, chap. 383], and that this land was situated on that part of the Colville Indian Reservation which had been opened to settlement and entry by \n\n[232 U.S. 442, 445]\n\u00a0\n the act of Congress. See act of July 1, 1892, 27 Stat. at L. 62, chap. 140. The district court, holding that the Agnes allotment was not a part of the Indian country within the meaning of the statute, sustained the demurrer; and the government brings this writ of error under the criminal appeals act, March 2, 1907 (34 Stat. at L. 1246, chap. 2564).\n There can be no doubt that the Colville Reservation, set apart by Executive order on July 2, 1872 (Exec. Ord. Ind. Reserv. [1912 ed.], 194, 195; 1 Kappler, 915, 916), and repeatedly recognized by acts of Congress, was a legally constituted reservation. Re Wilson, \n140 \nU.S. 575, 577\n, 35 S. L. ed. 513, 514, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 870. As such it was included in the 'Indian country' to which  2145 of the Revised Statutes refers, and it was none the less embraced within that description because it had been segregated from the public domain.

The inquiry then, is whether, with respect to the part States, \n164 \nU.S. 240, 242\n, 247 S., 41 L. ed. in the described allotment, the United States v. United States, \n228 \nU.S. 243, 271\n, 272 S., 57 L. ed. 820, 832, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. with crimes committed by or against Indians upon the lands within the reservation was not affected by the admission of the state of Washington into the Union ( act of February 22, 1889, chap. 180, 25 Stat. at L. 676, 677; Draper v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 240, 242\n, 247 S., 41 L. ed. 419, 420, 421, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 107; Donnelly of the reservation-with certain exceptions-was 'vacated and restored to the public 449, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 710); and we pass to the consideration of the effect of the Federal legislation by which the reservation was diminished.\n By the act of July 1, 1892, chap. 140, 27 Stat. at L. 62, a specified tract or portion of the reservation-with certain exceptions- was 'vacated and restored to the public domain,'\n July 4, 1884, chap. 180, 23 Stat. at L. 76, 79; February 8, 1887, chap. 119, 24 Stat. at L. 388; February 28, 1891, chap. 383, 26 Stat. at L. 794; July 1, 1892, chap. 140, 27 Stat. at L. 62; February 20, 1896, chap. 24, 29 Stat. at L. 9; March 6, 1896, chap. 42, 29 Stat. at L. 44; June 18, 1898, chap. 465, 30 Stat. at L. 475; July 1, 1898, chap. 545, 30 Stat. at L. 571, 593; March 22, 1906, chap. 1126, 34 Stat. at L. 80. \n\n[232 U.S. 442, 446]\n\u00a0\n and it was provided that this tract should be open to settlement and entry by the proclamation of the President, and should be disposed of under the general laws applicable to the disposition of public lands in the state of Washington. The exceptions were made by Congress in order to care for the Indians residing on that portion of the reservation. Every such Indian was entitled to select therefrom 80 acres which were to be allotted to the Indian in severalty ( 4). The titles to the lands selected were to 'be held in trust for the beneflt of the allottees, respectively, and afterwards conveyed in fee simple to the allottees or their heirs,' as provided in the acts of February 8, 1887 (24 Stat. at L. 388, chap. 119), and February 28, 1891 (26 Stat. at L. 794, chap. 383). Further, certain school and mill lands within the described tract were reserved from the operation of the statute, unless othekr lands were selected in their stead ( 6).\n The evident purpose of Congress was to carve out of the portion of the reservation restored to the public domain the lands to be allotted and reserved, as stated, and to make the restoration effective only as to the residue. The vacation and restoration which the statute accomplished ( 1) was of the statute, unless other lands were and allotment of lands in severalty to the individual members of the Indians of the Colville Reservation' for which the act provided. In 1898, in furtherance of the same object, Congress required the completion of the allotments as soon as practicable, and not later than six months after the President's proclamation (act of July 1, 1898, chap. 545, 30 Stat. at L. 571, 593). Accordingly the President issued his proclamation on April 10, 1900, declaring that the restored portion of the reservation would be open to settlement and entry on October 10, 1900, and an appropriate clause was inserted which saved and excepted such tracts as had been or might be 'allotted to or reserved or selected for the Indians, or other purposes,' \n\n[232 U.S. 442, 447]\n\u00a0\n under the governing statutes. 31 Stat. at L. 1963, 1965. The government presents extracts from the records of the Department of the Interior which purport to show that the actual allotment to the Indian Agnes, of the land described in the indictment, had been made prior to the date of this proclamation, and we are asked to take notice of that fact. We find it to be unnecessary to pass upon this, but we shall assume, in view of the grounds of the decision below, that the allotment was duly made under the statutory provisions to which we have referred, and it follows that these allotted lands must be demed to be among those excepted from the portion of the reservation which was thrown open to settlement.\n Although the lands were allotted in severalty, they were to be held in trust by the United States for twenty-five years for the sole use and benefit of the allottee, or his heirs, and during this period were to be inalienable. That the lands, being so held, continued to be under the jurisdiction and control of Congress for all governmental purposes relating to the guardianship and protection of the Indians, is not open to controversy. United States v. Rickert, \n188 \nU.S. 432, 437\n, 47 S. L. ed. 532, 536, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 478; McKay v. Kalyton, \n204 \nU.S. 458, 466\n, 468 S., 51 L. ed. 566, 570, 571, 27 Sup. Ct.

Rep. 578; Hallowell v. United States, \n221 U.S. 317\n, 55 L. ed. 750, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 587; United States v. Wright, \n229 \nU.S. 226, 237\n, 57 S. L. ed. 1160, 1166, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 630. Thus, in the act of January 30, 1897, chap. 109, 29 Stat. at L. 506, relating to the introduction of intoxicating liquor 'into the Indian country,' it is expressly provided that this term 'shall include any Indian allotment while the title to the same shall be held in trust by the government, or while the same shall remain inalienable by the allottee without the consent of the United States.' This statute was upheld in United States v. Sutton, \n215 U.S. 291\n, 54 L. ed. 200, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 116, as a valid exercise of Federal power with respect to allotments made under the \n\n[232 U.S. 442, 448]\n\u00a0\n act of February 8, 1887, within the Yakima Reservation in the state of Washington. Again, in Hallowell v. United States, \n221 U.S. 317\n, 55 L. ed. 750, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 587, the Federal jurisdiction under the same statute was sustained with respect to an allotment to an Omaha Indian in Nebraska, the title being held in trust by the government under the act of August 7, 1882 (22 Stat. at L. 341, chap. 434). There it appeared that practically all the lands in the Omaha Reservation had been allotted, and that many of the allotments of deceased Indians had passed into the hands of the whites, without out restrictions, under the provisions of the act of May 27, 1902 ( 32 Stat. at L. 275, chap. 888). Further, the Omaha Indians were exercising the rights of citizenship within the state, and the defendant himself, who was charged with taking liquor to his own allotment, was a citizen and had served as a public officer. The question certified to this court was, in effect, whether the fact that the allotment was held by the government in trust authorized Congress to regulate or prohibit the introduction of liquor. This question was answered in the affirmative, the court saying (p. 324): 'In the case at bar, the United States had not parted with the title to the lands, but still held them in trust for the Indians. In that situation its power to make rules and regulations respecting such territory was ample. . . . While for many purposes the jurisdiction of the state of Nebraska had attached, and the Indian as a citizen was entitled to the rights, privileges, and immunities of citizenship, still the United States, within its own territory and in the interest of the Indians, had jurisdiction to pass laws protecting such Indians from the evil results of intoxicating liquors as was done in the act of January 30, 1897, which made it an offense to introduce intoxicating liquors into such Indian country, including an Indian allotment.' It cannot be doubted that the power of Congress was quite as complete to punish crimes committed by or against Indians upon \n\n[232 U.S. 442, 449]\n\u00a0\n allotted lands of this character as to prohibit the introduction of liquor. The present question, then, is not one of power, but whether it can be said that the descriptive term 'Indian country,' as it is used in  2145 of the Revised Statutes, is inadequate to embrace these allotments, or, if it is adequate for that purpose, whether Congress, in providing for the allotments, has excluded them from the purview of that statute.\n We find no inadequacy in the statutory description. The lands, which, prior to the allotment, undoubtedly formed part of the Indian country, still retain during the trust period a distinctively Indian character, being devoted to Indian occupancy under the limitations imposed by Federal legislation. The explicit provision in the act of 1897, as to allotments, we do not regard as pointing a distinction, but rather as emphasizing the intent of Congress in carrying out its policy with respect to allotments in severalty where these have been accompanied with restrictions upon alienation or provision for trusteeship on the part of the government. In the present case, the original reservation was Indian country simply because it had been validly set apart for the use of the Indians as such, under the superintendence of the government. Donnelly v. United States, \n228 \nU.S. 243, 271\n, 272 S., 57 L. ed. 820, 832, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 449, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 710. The same considerations, in substance, apply to the allotted lands which, when the reservation was diminished, were excepted from the portion restored to the public domain. The allottees were permitted to enjoy a more secure tenure, and provision was made for their ultimate ownership without restrictions. But, meanwhile, the lands remained Indian lands, set apart for Indians under governmental care; and we are unable to find ground for the conclusion that they became other than Indian country through the distribution into separate holdings, the government retaining control.\n It is said that it is not to be supposed that Congress has intended to maintain the Federal jurisdiction over hun- \n\n[232 U.S. 442, 450]\n\u00a0\n dreds of allotments scattered through territory other portions of which were open to white settlement. But Congress expressly so provided with respect to offenses committed in violation of the act of 1897. Nor does the territorial jurisdiction of the United States depend upon the size of the particular areas which are held for Federal purposes (Criminal Code,  272 [35 Stat. at L. 1142, chap. 321, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1671 ]). It must be remembered that the fundamental consideration is the protection of a dependent people. As the court said in United States v. Rickert, \n188 \nU.S. 432, 437\n, 47 S. L. ed. 532, 536, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 478, where allotments had been made under the conditions provided by the act of February 8, 1887 (and it was found that the agreement with the Indians, 26 Stat. at L. 1035-1038, chap. 543, did not indicate any different relation of the United States to the allotted lands from that created or recognized by that act): 'These Indians are yet wards of the nation, and a condition of pupilage or dependency, and have not been discharged from that condition. They occupy these lands with the consent and authority of the United States; and the holding of them by the United States under the act of 1887, and the agreement of 1889, ratified by the act of 1891, is part of the national policy by which the Indians are to be maintained as well as prepared for assuming the habits of civilized life, and ultimately the privileges of citizenship.' It is true that by  6 of the act of 1887 it was provided that upon the completion of the allotments and the patenting of the lands to the allottees under that act, every allottee should 'have the benefit of and be subject to the laws, both civil and criminal, of the state of territory' in which he resided. See Re. Heff, \n197 U.S. 488\n, 49 L. ed. 848, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 506. But, by the act of May 8, 1906, chap. 2348 ( 34 Stat. at L. 182), Congress amended this section so as distinctly to postpone to the expiration of the trust period the subjection of allottees under that act to state laws. The first part of the section, as amended, is: 'That at the expiration of the trust period, and when the \n\n[232 U.S. 442, 451]\n\u00a0\n lands have been conveyed to the Indians by patent in fee, as provided in  5 of this act, then each and every allottee shall have the benefit of and be subject to the laws, both civil and criminal, of the state or territory in which they may reside.' And, at the same time, there was added to the section the explicit proviso: 'That until the issuance of fee-simple patents all allottees to whom trust patents shall hereafter be issued shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.' We deem it to be clear that Congress had the power thus to continue the guardianship of the government (United States v. Kagama, \n118 \nU.S. 375, 383\n, 384 S., 30 L. ed. 228, 231, 6 Sup. Ct.

It is not alleged in the indictment that the defendants were Indians, and we assume that they were not. But the court below had jurisdiction if the deceased was an Indian ward. Donnelly v. United States, \n228 U.S. 269\n-272, 57 L. ed. 831, 832, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 449, Ann. Cas. 1913E, 710. It is alleged, as already stated, that the deceased was 'a full-blood Indian, a member of the Colville tribe,' and, further, that he had received an allotment of land under the act of 1887, as amended in 1891, and under the act of July 1, 1892, the land being held in trust by the United States for twenty-five years from the date of the patent, July, 31, 1900. Upon this statement, the deceased must be regarded as one who was still under the government's care. Congress had not terminated that relation, and the com- \n\n[232 U.S. 442, 452]\n\u00a0\n mission of a crime against his person upon Indian lands, such as we have found the allotted lands in question to be, was punishable under the laws of the United States.\n The order sustaining the demurrer is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","266":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. YOUNG(1914)\nNo. 710\nArgued: Decided: January 26, 1914\n\n\n\n Solicitor General Davis for plaintiff in error.\n No appearance for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna delivered the opinion of the court:\n Indictment under  215 of the Criminal Code [35 Stat. at L. 1130, chap. 321, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1653], charging the use of the mails in furtherance of a scheme to defraud. \n\n[232 U.S. 155, 156]\n\u00a0\n It consists of two counts to which demurrer was filed, which, in specific objections, challenged the sufficiency of the indictment. The demurrer was sustained and judgment entered, quashing the indictment. The charges of the indictment, condensed, are as follows:\n On the 5th of May, 1911, within the county of Mobile and the jurisdiction of the court, defendant devised a scheme and artifice to defraud various banks, persons, and corporations, particularly such as could be induced, through the firm of Hollingshead & Campbell, of New York city, to purchase or lend money upon the notes of the Southern Hardware & Supply Company, engaged in the mercantile business at Mobile, Alabama, and of which defendant was the president.\n Hollingshead & Campbell were money brokers engaged in the business of inducing banks, persons, and corporations to purchase and lend money upon commercial paper, and it was the intention and purpose of defendant in his negotiations with said firm to induce and cause it to sell and dispose of the notes of the Hardware & Supply Company, and to obtain money and credit for its notes and other evidences of indebtedness. The defendant was authorized to sign such notes and other evidences of indebtedness, and to prepare statements of the financial and business condition of the company.\n It was a part of the scheme for defendant to induce Hollingshead & Campbell to sell and dispose of the notes of the Hardware & Supply Company, and to persuade and influence the various banks, etc., to lend money upon the notes of that company, to prepare and cause to be prepared and sent through the United States mails to Hollingshead & Campbell false and fraudulent statements of the business affairs and financial condition of the Hardware & Supply Company, and which defendant was to, and did, represent to be statements showing the correct and true condition of the business affairs and financial condition \n\n[232 U.S. 155, 157]\n\u00a0\n of the Hardware & Supply Company. These statements did not show the true condition of the company's affairs, but were to show and did show its assets to be greatly in excess of those actually had and owned by it, and its liabilities to be much less than their true amount, and 'falsely and fraudulently showed the company to be in a much better financial condition than it was in fact at the time such statements were made and were to be made.'\n Part of the scheme was to make Hollingshead & Campbell believe the statements were correct, and they did make that firm so believe, and to rely upon them; and, so relying upon their truth, to recommend the purchase of the Hardware & Supply Company's notes and the lending of money upon them, defendant knowing that that company 'was not then and there in a strong financial condition.'\n Defendant caused the statements to be sent through the United States mails to Hollingshead and Campbell. Hollingshead & Campbell believed them, and, relying upon their truth, recommended barious banks, persons, and corporations to purchase the notes and lend money upon the notes of the Hardware & Supply Company. The names of certain banks and the amounts they loaned are given.\n For the purpose of executing the scheme and artifice, defendant deposited in the United States postoffice at Mobile, Alabama, a letter, dated June 27, 1911, addressed to Hollingshead & Campbell at New York. The letter contained a statement of the financial condition of the company, showing the assets, liabilities, and profits of the Hardware & Supply Company. It also contained comments upon the business of the company and its relations with Hollingshead & Campbell. It was sent through the mails and delivered to the latter at New York. The letter and the statements are charged to have shown the assets of the Hardware & Supply Company to be greater \n\n[232 U.S. 155, 158]\n\u00a0\n and its liabilities to be less than they actually were. And it is charged that defendant, having devised a scheme and artifice to defraud, and for the purpose of their execution, placed and caused to be placed in the United States postoffice at Mobile, Alabama, the letter above stated, and that it was sent and delivered by the Postoffice Establishment of the United States.\n The second count in the indictment charges defendant with having devised 'a scheme and artifice for obtaining moneys, goods, and chattels by means of false and fraudulent representations and promises from various banks, persons, firms, and corporations.' The manner and means are charged as in the first count.\n The scheme, it will be ovserved, was to defraud certain banks and persons, and it was to be accomplished by deception practised on Hollingshead & Campbell, money brokers, through false statements sent to that company through the mails, whereby they would be induced to recommend the commercial value of the notes and other evidences of indebtedness of the Southern Hardware & Supply Company, of which defendant was the president. The first count charges a scheme to defraud various banks, etc., through the representations of Hollingshead & Campbell, 'out of their's, the said banks', and persons', firms', and corporations' moneys, goods, and chattels.' In the second count the scheme is alleged to be 'for obtaining moneys, goods, and chattels by means of false and fraudulent representations and promises' from the various banks and persons.\n Commenting on the indictment, the district court said: 'The first count of the indictment does not clearly set out the scheme to defraud. It fails to allege that the scheme devised to defraud said banks, etc., was by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises. And it fails to allege how the scheme was to be executed. It does not allege that the scheme devised was to be executed by \n\n[232 U.S. 155, 159]\n\u00a0\n the use of the Postoffice Establishment or mails of the United States.' The conclusion of the court was that the 'said first count of the indictment' was 'defective and insufficient.'\n Further commenting, the court said: 'The second count of the indictment is subject to the same defects and objections as are found in the first count, except that the second count does allege that the scheme to defraud was by means of false and fraudulent representations and promises. It does not directly allege that the scheme to defraud was to be executed by the use of the Postoffice Establishment or mails of the United States. In some part of the second count it is implied in an allegation in this way: That it was a part of the said scheme that the defendant was to and did prepare statements of the business affairs and financial condition of the Southern Hardware & Supply Company, and sent the same to Hollingshead & Campbell to induce them to do certain things, etc. The gist of the offense is the use of the United States mails in the execution of the scheme, or in attempting so to do. It is not an unlawful scheme unless the use of the mails was a part of the scheme, and the indictment must affirmatively allege every fact necessary to constitute the offense sought to be charged, that the court may see that an unlawful scheme has been devised. It is alleged that said statements were false and fraudulent, and that they were sent through the mails to Hollingshead & Campbell, from which it might be implied that such was a part and intention of the scheme.' The court further said that implication of a material and essential fact could not supply the place of its direct averment; that there was no allegation that the banks and others to be defrauded had seen the statements sent Hollingshead & Campbell, or had knowledge of them or of their contents, or that they were intended to deceive the banks, and to induce them to lend their money, except as this might be implied from \n\n[232 U.S. 155, 160]\n\u00a0\n sending the statements to Hollingshead & Campbell. The court expressed the opinion that while 'the second count is better than the first, it is insufficient in the particulars mentioned.'\n We have made these quotations from the court's opinion as the case is here by direct appeal under the criminal appeals act as involving the construction of the statute, and not of the indictment. And this is the contention of the government, and that the court erred in failing to 'note the essential differences between  5480 of the Revised Statutes (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 3696), and  215 of the Criminal Code (act of March 4, 1909 [35 Stat. at L. 1130, chap. 321, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1653]) which succeeded it.'\n Section 5480 provided: 'If any person having devised, or intending to devise, any scheme or artifice to defraud . . . to be effected by either opening or intending to open correspondence or communication with any person, whether resident within or outside the United States, by means of the Postoffice Establishment of the United States, or by inciting such other person or any person to open communication with the person so devising or intending, shall, in [effecting] and for executing such scheme . . . place or cause to be placed any letter . . . in any postoffice . . . to be sent or delivered by the said Postoffice Establishment, . . . such person so misusing the Postoffice Establishment shall, upon conviction, be punishable . . ..' follows: 'Whoever having devised, or intending to devise, any scheme or artifice to defraud or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, . . . shall, for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, or attempting so to do, place . . . any letter, . . . whether addressed to any person within or outside the United States, in any post- \n\n[232 U.S. 155, 161]\n\u00a0\n office, . . . to be sent or delivered by the Postoffice Establishment of the United States, . . . shall be fined. . . .'\n It is contended by the government that these provisions are broader than those of  5480 of the Revised Statutes; that under the latter it was necessary to charge not only a scheme to defraud was devised, but that it was intended to be effected by opening or intending to open correspondence with some other person by means of the Postoffice Establishment. Under  215 of the Criminal Code it is only necessary that the scheme should be devised or intended to be devised, and a letter be placed in the postoffice for the purpose of executing the scheme or attempting to do so. And as declaring the elements of the offense under  215, and its distinction from an offense under  5480 of the Revised Statutes, the following cases are cited: Ex parte King, 200 Fed. 622; United States v. Maxey, 200 Fed. 997; Stockton v. United States (C. C. A. 7th C.) 46 L.R.A.( N.S.) 936, 205 Fed. 462; United States v. Goldman, 207 Fed. 1002\n\n\n There is a distinction between the sections, and the elements of an offense under  215 are (a) a scheme devised or intended to be devised to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false pretenses, and (b) for the purpose of executing such scheme or attempting to do so, the placing of any letter in any postoffice of the United States, to be sent or delivered by the Postoffice Establishment. The district court apparently overlooked the distinction between the sections, and was of opinion that something more was necessary to an offense under  215 than the averment of the scheme, and its attempted execution in the manner stated. The court expressed the view, we have seen, that the indictment did not clearly set out the scheme to defraud; that it did not allege the scheme devised or attempted was by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, or that \n\n[232 U.S. 155, 162]\n\u00a0\n the scheme was to be executed by the use of the Postoffice Establishment or mails of the United States. And the court said that it was a necessary element of the offense that the false statements sent to Hollingshead & Campbell by defendant were to be used by the latter company to induce the person intended to be defrauded to purchase the notes of the Southern Hardware & Supply Company, or to lend money upon them, or that such person had knowledge of the contents of the statements. It is manifest that the court considered these facts were necessary to be averred in order to constitute an offense under  215. In this the court was in error.\n Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with direction to overrule the demurrer. \n\n\n\n","267":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNION LIME CO. v. CHICAGO & N. W.

Chicago & N. W. Ry. Co. \n233 U.S. 211\n (1914) ]\n\n\n[233 U.S. 211, 216]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Walter Drew, Edward M. Smart, Edward M. Hyzer, L. E. Lurvey, and Mr. W. C. Owen, attorney general of the state of Wisconsin, for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This proceeding was instituted by the Chicago & Northwestern Railway Company to take land for a spur, the construction of which had been ordered by the Railroad Commission of the state. The land was owned by the Union Lime Company, the plaintiff in error, and the application was resisted upon the ground that it was sought to be taken for a private, and not a public, use, and therefore that its taking would operate as a deprivation of the property of the plaintiff in error without due process of law, and a denial to it of the equal protection of the laws, contrary to the 14th Amendment. This contention was overruled by the supreme court of the state, which affirmed the judgment in condemnation (152 Wis. 633, 140 N. W. 346), and this writ of error was sued out.\n The proposed track was to form an extension of an \n\n[233 U.S. 211, 217]\n\u00a0\n existing spur, owned and operated by the railway company, which leads from its main line to the quarries and kilns of two lime companies; one of these companies is the plaintiff in error, at whose works the spur now terminates. Beyond these works lie those of the Eden Independent Lime & Stone Company, which applied to the Railroad Commission for an order requiring the railway company to extend the spur to its plant. It is provided by  1797-11m of the Wisconsin Statutes that every railroad shall acquire the necessary right of way and shall construct and operate a 'reasonably adequate and suitable spur track' whenever it does not necessarily exceed 3 miles in length, is 'practically indispensable to the successful operation' of any existing or proposed manufacturing establishment, and is not 'unusually unsafe' or 'unreasonably harmful.' The railroad may require the person, firm, or corporation primarily to be served thereby to pay the legitimate cost of acquiring, by condemnation or purchase, the necessary right of way for the spur and of its construction, as determined by the Railroad Commission. By  1797-12n, the Commission is authorized to receive complaints, in case of the failure or refusal of railroads to perform the prescribed duty, and to make appropriate orders. Acting under these sections, the\n These sections, enacted by chapter 352 of the Laws of 1907, as amended by chapter 481 of the Laws of 1909 and chapters 193, 663 of the Laws of 1911, are as follows:\n'Section 1797-11m. 1. Every railroad shall acquire the necessary rights of way for, and shall construct, connect, maintain, and operate a reasonably adequate and suitable spur track, whenever such spur track does not necessarily exceed 3 miles in length, is practically indispensable to the successful operation of any existing or proposed mill, elevator, storehouse, warehouse, dock, wharf, pier, manufacturing establishment, lumber yard, coal dock, or other industry or enterprise, and its construction and operation is not unusually unsafe and dangerous and is not unreasonably harmful to public interest.\n\n'2. Such railroad may require the person or persons, firm, corporations, or association primarily to be served thereby, to pay the legitimate cost and expense of acquiring, by condemnation or purchase, the necessary rights of way for such spur track, and of constructing the same, as shall be determined in separate items by the commission, in which case the total estimated cost thereof shall be deposited with the railroad before the railroad shall be required to incur any expense whatever therefor; provided, however, that when any such person, firm, or corporation, or association shall be required by the commission to deposit with the railroad the total estimated cost, as herein provided, such person, firm, corporation, or association may offer or cause to be offered a proposition in writing to such railroad, to construct such spur track, such proposition to be accompanied by a surety company bond, running to such railroad, and conditioned upon the construction of such spur track in a good and workmanlike manner, according to the plans and specifications provided by such railroad, and approved by the commission, and deposit with such railroad the estimated cost of the necessary right of way for such spur track; and whenever such proposition and security company bond shall be offered, the person, firm, corporation, or association primarily to be served thereby shall not be required to deposit as herein provided, as the total estimated cost of such construction, an amount in excess of the estimated cost of the right of way, and the total amount stated in such written proposition. Provided further that before the railroad shall be required to incur any \n\n[233 U.S. 211, 218]\n\u00a0\n Commission directed the railway company to extend the spur as desired by the Eden Company, and thereupon this proceeding was brought to condemn the land for the right of way.\n\n The assignments of error come to the single point,-as to the character of the use. The state, through its highest court, declares the use to be a public one, and we should accept its judgment unless it is clearly without ground. \n\n[233 U.S. 211, 219]\n\u00a0\n Fallbrook Irrig.

The general authority to exercise the power of eminent domain for the construction of spurs is found in  1831a, Stat. (Wis.), which provides: 'Every railway company . . . may build, maintain, and operate branches and spur tracks from its road or any branch thereof to and upon the grounds of any mill, elevator, storehouse, warehouse, dock, wharf, pier, manufacturing establishment, lumber yard, coal dock, or other industry or enterprise, . . . ; and every such company may acquire by purchase or condemnation in the manner provided in this chapter for the acquisition of real estate for railway purposes, other than for its main track, all necessary roadways and rights \n\n[233 U.S. 211, 220]\n\u00a0\n of way for such branches, spur tracks,' etc. The supreme court of the state sustained the validity of this provision in Chicago & N. W. R. Co. v. Morehouse, 112 Wis. 1, 56 L.R.A. 240, 88 Am. St. Rep. 918, 87 N. W. 849, holding (p. 11) that 'the fact that a spur track may run to a single industry does not militate against the devotion of the property thereto being a public use thereof, so long as the purpose of maintaining the track is to serve all persons who may desire it, and all can demand, as a right, to be served, without discrimination.'\n In Union Lime Co. v. Railroad Commission, 144 Wis. 523, 129 N. W. 605, the court had under review an earlier order of the Commission requiring the railroad to build the spur extension now in question, and, while that order was set aside because a proper hearing had not been afforded, it was held that the spur would not be a private track, but would be devoted to a public use. In the view that the tracks contemplated would be of this character, the court sustained the statutes ( 1797-11m and 1797-12n), under which the Commission was proceeding, against the same objections that are now raised. The court said (id. pp. 533, 534): 'Such track when built becomes a portion of the trackage of the railroad. The fact that its initial cost is borne by the party primarily to be served, with provisions for subsequent equitable division of such cost, does not make it a private track nor change the nature of its use. Over it the products of the industry find their way into the markets of the world, and every consumer is directly interested in the lessened cost of such products resulting from the building and operation thereof. That these products are supplied by a single owner, or by a limited number of owners, affects the extent, and not the nature, of its use,-the track is none the less a part of the avenue through which the commodities reach the public. Subject to the equitable division of initial cost, the track is at the service of the public as much as any other, and it constitutes an integral part of the railroad system. The \n\n[233 U.S. 211, 221]\n\u00a0\n duty to maintain and operate it rests upon the railroad. Except that it is relieved of the initial cost of right of way and construction, the track stands in the same relation to it that any other portion of its track does. The owner of the industry obtains no interest in or control over it beyond that of being served by it equally with anyone else who may desire to use it.' This decision was followed in the present case. 152 Wis. 633, 637, 140 N. W. 346.\n Assailing this ruling, the plaintiff in error insists that the statute itself (referring to  1797-11m and 1797-12n) authorizes the taking of property for private use, and that, being unconstitutional on its face, it cannot form the basis of any valid proceeding. It is said, in the first place, that the statute does not declare in terms or by necessary implication that the use for which the property is to be taken is a public use. But this contention is plainly without merit, as the statute must be read in the light of the construction placed upon it by the state court, which has held the described use to be a public one. The judgment of the state, so far as it is competent to determine the matter, has thus been fully expressed.\n It is urged, further, that the statute is necessarily invalid because it establishes as the criterion of the Commission's action the exigency of a private business. This objection, however, fails to take account of the distinction between the requirements of industry and trade which may warrant the building of a branch track, and the nature of the use to which it is devoted when built. A spur may, at the outset, lead only to a single industry or establishment; it may be constructed to furnish an outlet for the products of a particular plant; its cost may be defrayed by those in special need of its service at the time. But none the less, by virtue of the conditions under which it is provided, the spur may constitute at all times a part of the transportation facilities of the carrier which are operated under the obligations of public service, and are \n\n[233 U.S. 211, 222]\n\u00a0\n subject to the regulation of public authority. As was said by this court in Hairston v. Danville & W. R. Co. \n208 \nU.S. 598, 608\n, 52 S. L. ed. 637, 641, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 331, 13 Ann. Cas. 1008: 'The uses for which the track was desired are not the less public because the motive which dictated its location over this particular land was to reach a private industry, or because the proprietors of that industry contributed in any way to the cost.' There is a clear distinction between spurs which are owned and operated by a common carrier as a part of its system and under its public obligation and merely private sidings. See State, De Camp, Prosecutor v. Hibernia Underground R. Co. 47 N. J. L. 43; Chicago, B. & N. R. Co. v. Porter, 43 Minn. 527, 46 N. W. 75; Ulmer v. Lime Orck R.

Chicago I. & L. R. Co. 175 Ind. 303, 35 L.R.A.(N.S.) 641, 94 N. E. 326.\n While common carriers may not be compelled to make unreasonable outlays (Missouri P. R. Co. v. Nebraska, \n217 U.S. 196\n, 54 L. ed. 727, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 461, 18 Ann. Cas. 989), it is competent for the state, acting within the sphere of its jurisdiction, to provide for an extension of their transportation facilities, under reasonable conditions, so as to meet the demands of trade; and it may impress upon these extensions of the carriers' lines, thus furnished under the direction or authority of the state, a public character regardless of the number served at the beginning. The branch or spur comes into existence as a public utility, and as such is always available as localities change and communities grow. The supreme court of Wisconsin has left no doubt with respect to the public obligations imposed upon the carrier in relation to the spurs and branches to be provided under the statute in question, and we find no ground for the conclusion that this enactment was beyond the state power.\n It is also contended by the plaintiff in error that the finding by the state court that the use in the present case is a public one is not supported by the facts. But this \n\n[233 U.S. 211, 223]\n\u00a0\n criticism of the court's finding is in substance a repetition of the argument that is urged against the validity of the statute, and what has been said upon that point is applicable.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n expense whatever in the construction of said spur track, the person, firm, corporation, or association primarily to be served thereby shall give the railroad a bond to be approved by the commission as to form, amount, and surety, securing the railroad against loss on account of any expense incurred beyond the amount so deposited with the railroad.\n'3.

The next day Larrinaga answered, acknowledging the letter 'wherein you propose me a share of 10 per cent in the property of the concession for the \n\n[233 U.S. 705, 709]\n\u00a0\n utilization of waters from the La Plata river at the point called el Salto, near Comerio, I, in exchange, to help you in the steps to he gone through and in everything in connection with said concession, such as plans, projects, and all what concerns to the technical part. I hereby accept the participation of 10 per cent of said concession in exchange of my personal or professional services without any obligation on my part' to contribute money to the exploitation.\n It is objected in the first place that the case is not one for equitable relief. But whether the contract created a partnership under the definition of the Civil Code of Porto Rico,  1567, as argued by the appellee, or not, it gave the appellee an equitable interest in the concession to the extent of securing his share of the profits, if any, and attached to these profits specifically if and when they came into being. Barnes v. Alexander, \n232 \nU.S. 117, 121\n, 58 S. L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 276. It established a fiduciary relation between Valdes, who had legal control, and the plaintiff. The bill alleges an abuse of the relation by a secret transaction from which it is alleged that the profits accrued. It is a proper case for equitable relief.\n It is contended more energetically that the contract was against public policy. We shall not speculate nicely as to exactly what the law was in Porto Rico at the time when the contract was made, but shall give the plaintiff the benefit of the decisions upon which he relies, such as Hazelton v. Sheckells, \n202 U.S. 71\n, 50 L. ed. 939, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 567, 6 Ann. Cas. 217. But we discover nothing in the language of the letters that necessarily imports, or even persuasively suggests, any improper intent or dangerous tendency. Larrinaga had ceased to be assistant secretary, and while in that position had refused to take part in the plan. His answer, which must control if there is any difference, as the parties went ahead on it (Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. v. Columbus Rolling Mill, \n119 U.S. 149\n, 30 L. ed. 376, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 168), binds him to help in the steps to be \n\n[233 U.S. 705, 710]\n\u00a0\n gone through, and in the technical part. If his help in the steps to be gone through was not to be, like the rest of his work, in the technical part alone, still there is nothing to indicate that it was of a kind that could not be stipulated for. In view of the subject-matter, a grant, it would seem, to a riparian owner, of the right to use water power for public service, the things done, such as joining in an application to the military governor for a franchise on the footing of a joint interest, or helping to present it to the Secretary of War when it came up to him, or preparing plans and specifications to be presented to the executive council of Porto Rico when the first franchise granted by the Secretary of War had been lost by not complying with its terms, have no sinister smack. We see nothing to control the decision of the district judge that the contract was not against the policy of the law.\n As we have intimated, the executive council of Porto Rico was applied to after the loss of the first franchise, and it granted a new one on December 17, 1900; but after some extensions of time it declared the grant forfeited in July, 1902. Valdes and the plaintiff, however, did not admit the forfeiture, and Valdes procured the formation of a Maine corporation to take over his rights. On January 14, 1905, he made a preliminary contract for the sale of the franchise alleged to be forfeited, and lands, easements, and options for use in connection with the same, reciting that he had petitioned for a new concession, or confirmation of the franchise. For this he was to receive $27,000, par value, of the mortgage bonds of the new company, and $102,778, par value, of its stock, to be put in escrow until the company got a good title to the water rights and the franchise applied for. On June 1, 1905, in pursuance of the contract, a conveyance was made of the easements and lands that Valdes owned on the La Plata and his right to construct works there on the terms above \n\n[233 U.S. 705, 711]\n\u00a0\n mentioned, with a slight change of the figures, to $28,000 and $103,000 respectively. The franchise was granted on January 4, 1906, the grant expressly providing that it should not be deemed a recognition of any right of Valdes to any previous grant.\n On these facts it is argued that the concession in which Larrinaga was interested was not sold by Valdes, and was not the source of any profit. That Valdes purported to sell it by his conveyance, as he agreed to sell it by the contract which the conveyance referred to and executed, or else that his rights under it passed sub silentio with the land, we think admits of no doubt. And while it may be true that the sale would not be likely to have taken place without a confirmation or regrant of the franchise, still, as between these parties, it seems fairly probable that there was a continuous pursuit of the end; that, while the franchise gave the value to the land, the land gave a locus standi to the franchise; that, notwithstanding the disclaimer of the executive council, the position of Valdes as riparian owner and previous grantee had their effect on the final grant; and that, at all events, when the contract was made on January 14, 1905, Larrinaga became entitled to receive his 10 per cent when that contract should be carried out.\n The last objection to the decree is, that the court did not deduct from the sum paid the value of the other property which entered into the consideration. We do not think it clear that Larrinaga did not stipulate for 10 per cent of the land as well as of the franchise. The Spanish is not before us, and the words '10 per cent in the property of the concession' well might mean that. At all events no error of magnitude is made out, and without mentioning every detail it is enough to add that no sufficient reason is shown why the decree should not be affirmed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","269":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVAN DYKE v. CORDOVA COPPER CO(1914)\nNo. 735\nArgued: Decided: June 8, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 188, 189]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Richard E. Sloan and James Westervelt for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. John H. Campbell, W. J. Hughes, and Karl W. Kirchwey for defendant in error.\n\n Memorandum opinion by Mr. Chief Justice White, by direction of the Court:\n This action was brought on December 2, 1911, by the Cordova Copper Company in the 'district court of the fifth judicial district of the territory of Arizona in and for the county of Gila' to recover sums of money alleged to have been loaned to Van Dyke, the plaintiff in error, and remaining unpaid. The case was tried in April and May, 1912, after the admission of Arizona as a state, in the 'superior court of Gila county, state of Arizona,' and resulted in a verdict on May 4 for $15,364.75, upon which judgment was entered on the same day. On May 16, Van Dyke moved for a new trial, which motion was, at the instance of the company, stricken from the files. An appeal was taken to the supreme court of the state. The court, deciding that the appeal was taken alone from the judgment, and that there was no reversible error in the \n\n[234 U.S. 188, 190]\n\u00a0\n judgment roll, held that it could not review errors which were alone susceptible of being reviewed upon an appeal from an order refusing a new trial, although treating the motion to strike out as equivalent to such refusal, and the judgment was consequently affirmed. This writ of error was then prosecuted, and the case is before us on a motion to dismiss.\n Neither in the assignments of error nor in the argument at bar is it asserted that Federal rights were raised or involved in the court below, but the assertion that the case is within our jurisdiction rests solely upon the provisions of  32 and 33 of the Arizona enabling act of June 20 1910 (36 Stat. at L. pp. 557, 576, 577, chap. 310). The sections in question, generally speaking, provide for the trial of cases pending at the time of admission to statehood, and for their transfer to the appropriate courts established under the new system, and the particular language upon which the controversy turns is this:\n'. . . and that from all judgments and decrees or other determinations of any court of the said territory, in any case begun prior to admission, the parties to such cause shall have the same right to prosecute appeals, writs of error, and petitions for review to the Supreme Court of the United States or to the circuit court of appeals as they would have had by law prior to the admission of said state into the Union.'\n\n The contention is that as this case was 'begun prior to admission,' and is one which, in consequence of the amount involved, might have been brought to this court from a judgment of the supreme court of the territory; therefore it comes within the express terms of the statute and there is jurisdiction. But, conceding the premise, we think the conclusion is clearly in conflict with the plain language of the provision relied upon. We say this because the right to prosecute writs of error conferred is limited to 'judgments and decrees or other determinations of any court of \n\n[234 U.S. 188, 191]\n\u00a0\n the said territory,' thus obviously excluding the right to review in a case like this where, although 'begun prior to admission,' the case was tried after the conferring of statehood, and judgment rendered in a state court. It may indeed be, as suggested in the argument, that to thus construe the provision renders superfluous the phrase 'in any cause begun prior to admission,' since, in the nature of things, no judgment could be rendered by a territorial court unless the action had been brought prior to the admission of Arizona as a state. But we may not, in order to give effect to those words, virtually destroy the meaning of the entire context; that is, give them a significance which would be clearly repugnant to the statute, looked at as a whole, and destructive of its obvious intent. The statute was enacted for a twofold purpose: first, to save the right of appeal which had arisen and was in existence in cases decided prior to statehood in the methods contemplated by existing laws; and second, to appropriately distribute and provide for the transfer of untried and pending causes to the new courts which would come into existence under the new system. Passing the question of power to so do, it could not be assumed, except as the result of the most unequivocal direction to that end, that the statute was intended to create a new and strange method of procedure unknown to our constitutional system of government, by which the judgments to be rendered by state courts in cases which the statute contemplated should be transferred to such courts for trial, should be reviewed not according to the methods provided by the state law for such judgments, but by the Federal courts, although no Federal question of any kind was present to give such courts jurisdiction. That no such anomaly could possibly have been contemplated is shown by the proviso of  33 of the act, making cases in the supreme court of the territory, which were pending at the time of statehood, and which were transferred to the highest \n\n[234 U.S. 188, 192]\n\u00a0\n court of the state, reviewable by this court not as judgments of territorial courts, but, on the contrary, as judgments of state courts; in other words, making it plain that it was not contenplated that, after a case had been transferred to and decided by a state court, it would be subject to a review in this court, simply because it was pending in the territorial court at the time of the enabling act, as if it were a judgment of a territorial court.\n Dismissed for want of jurisdictoin. \n\n\n\n","270":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVAN SYCKEL v.

Fixing their attention upon the controlling force of the reasons which the court had stated in its opinion, and the decisive character of the findings embodied in the statement of facts, the parties who believed themselves aggrieved at once appealed, but their appeal was dismissed for want of a final judgment. \n220 U.S. 601\n, 55 L. ed. 603, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 716. The case is now here on an appeal from a final judgment, and the contentions previously relied upon to secure a reversal are applicable, and now require to be decided.\n This suit was begun by the widow and heirs of Paul Van Syckel to liquidate and distribute the assets of two partnerships of which he was a member, viz., P. Van Syckel & Company and the Santa Cruz Sugar Company. The defendants were the other members of the firms. From the petition and the documents annexed, from the answer, and a cross petition filed by the defendants to construe and limit a document referred to as an agreement for 'postponement of rights,' as also from the issues taken on the cross petition, and from the opinion of the court and the statement of facts which it made, it is beyond question that the only controversy between the partners arose from an assertion by the widow and heirs of Van Syckel that they were the holders of a subsisting lease covering an important piece of partnership real estate.\n The solution of this controversy depended upon the answers proper to be made to the following questions: 1st. Did the lease which was owned by Van Syckel prior to the formation of the partnership of P. Van Syckel & Company pass to that firm as the result of its organization and the stipulations contained in the articles of partnership? 2d. If the firm became the owner of the lease, was such lease extinguished by confusion ( Civil Code,  1192) \n\n[231 U.S. 601, 603]\n\u00a0\n as the result of the purchase by the firm of the leased property under a foreclosure sale? and 3d, even although, as a general rule, the lease was extinguished under the conditions stated, could the surviving members of the firm be heard to deny the existence of the lease as against the widow and heirs of Van Syckel, in view of the public record concerning the lease, of the stipulations of the agreement styled 'postponement of rights,' of the foreclosure proceedings, and of other declarations made in other notarial acts to which the partnership and the partners were parties?\n Concluding that these questions required an affirmative answer, the court below rejected the claim based upon the existence of the alleged lease. The reasons which led to this conclusion were stated in an elaborate opinion, and the facts which were deemed controlling were enumerated in a statement of facts. While conceding that there is no power to review the facts, and while further conceding that if effect be given to the facts found, the judgment is clearly right, it is yet insisted by the appellants that there should be a reversal upon the following grounds: ( a) Because the ultimate findings made by the court as to the nonexistence of the lease were, on the face of the record, manifestly alone based upon inferences drawn from parol proof conflicting with the declarations of the parties contained in notarial acts, and which under the local law, were not lawfully susceptible of being overthrown by parol proof; and (b) because, moreover, error is manifest on the face of the findings as well as in the legal conclusions based on the findings, because it was impossible to conclude that the lease had no existence without permitting the defendants to repudiate their declarations made in notarial acts, to base a claim of right upon their deceit and fraud, and to discharge themselves and their property from an obligation by giving efficacy to their wrongdoing. As these propositions in their final analysis challenge the adequacy of the findings made to sustain the legal conclusions \n\n[231 U.S. 601, 604]\n\u00a0\n based on them, it is our duty to consider and to decide them. As a prelude to doing so, we make a statement of the case as established by the findings, and as elucidated by the opinion of the court and the documents therein referred to.\n In June, 1897, by notarial act, Paul Van Syckel leased from one Montilla, the Santa Cruz plantation except a small portion previously leased to someone else. The rent was payable monthly and the term was indeterminate; that is, was to last as long as Van Syckel chose to pay rent. The property when leased was encumbered by mortgage. Van Syckel used the leased property for the business of raising cattle and carrying on a dairy. The registration officer refusing to record the lease because of the uncertainty of the term, Van Syckel, in October 1899, made a notarial statement, fixing a term of six years, and reserving the right, at will, to fix future terms. The registering officer refusing to record this statement, Van Syckel sued to compel its registry, and was successful, the supreme court of Porto Rico (or the chief justice thereof) having affirmed an order directing the registry to be made. The holder of the mortgage on the leased property having commenced executory proceedings to foreclose, Van Syckel sued in the provisional court created by the American military authority to enjoin on the ground of an alleged fraudulent combination between the debtor and creditor by foreclosure of the paramount mortgage to wipe out the lease and impliedly, on the further ground that, having an interest, as lessee, in paying the paramount mortgage debt, he was entitled to do so and take a creditor's legal subrogation. Civil Code,  1203, 1210, and 1211. The foreclosure proceeding was perpetually enjoined. The mortgage creditor acquiescing in the result, in March, 1900, transferred the debt to Van Syckel. During these proceedings there were pending in the local courts, suits in one or another \n\n[231 U.S. 601, 605]\n\u00a0\n form, brought by Montilla, assailing the rights of Van Syckel. The exact character of these suits is not disclosed, but they are referred to in the findings, and a statement on the subject is contained in Montilla v. Van Syckel, 8 P. R. R. 153, 162.\n In June, 1900, before a notary, Van Syckel and the firm of Sobrinos de Ezquiaga, an established and reputable commercial firm, formed a partnership styled P. Van Syckel & Company. The act recited that Van Syckel was the owner of enumerated property, viz.: a small farm, a lot of cattle 'as per inventory,' a lot of personal property, constituting the plant of a dairy, such as cans, bottles, milk straining apparatus, carts, milk wagons, etc., etc., and besides a mortgage paper secured on the Santa Cruz plantation, inventoried at about 11,000 pesos; and lastly, a sum of money stated in the inventory as 'value of working capital,' amounting to 1111 pesos. These various items gave a total value of 30,000 pesos, and one half, 15,000 pesos, was paid in cash by Sobrinos de Ezquiaga to Van Syckel as the purchase of one half the property which thus became jointly owned, and was by the joint owners, Van Syckel and Sobrinos de Ezquiaga, established as the capital of the new firm. The duration of the firm was two years, and the purpose of its organization was declared to be the carrying on of a dairy business and the purchase of cattle. There were careful provisions as to the keeping and rendering of the accounts of the firm, as to the equal power of management by the partners, and an equal division between them of profits. There was a stipulation relating to the mortgage debt on Santa Cruz, providing that if the debtor, Montilla, paid the same, the sum received should take the place of the debt as firm capital, and the firm should not be dissolved thereby, and the same result, it was expressly provided, would follow in case Montilla should 'recuperate the debt' and require an assignment of the same; that is, in case \n\n[231 U.S. 601, 606]\n\u00a0\n Montilla, by operation of legal subrogation, compelled a transfer of the debt to another.\n The year following, in July, 1901, the firm of P. Van Syckel & Company and P. Van Syckel individually were parties to a notarial act styled 'postponement of right,' by which the firm, after reciting its ownership of the mortgage claim on the Santa Cruz property and the paramount character of the mortgage as to a lease on the property held by Van Syckel, waived the priority of the mortgage, gave precedence to the lease, and expressly renounced all right of the mortgage creditor 'to rescind the lease' as against Van Syckel and his 'causa habientes.' This act was placed on the public records. In September, 1901, Van Syckel & Company commenced executory proceedings against Montilla to enforce their mortgage debt, and in due course, in November, 1911, the property was adjudicated to them for two thirds of its estimated value, and, as was customary under the local law, the state of the record was referred to, and the priority of the recorded lease was recited.\n In May, 1902, the firm of P. Van Syckel & Company was, by notarial agreement, extended for a period of four years to the 1st day of June, 1906. The articles of extension recited the original organization, the purchase from Van Syckel of the property which constituted the capital of the firm, including the debt secured by mortgage upon Santa Cruz. It then recited the foreclosure and the purchase of the property at less than the face value of the mortgage debt, and stipulated that the capital of the new firm should not be thereby diminished as the property took the place of the debt as a partnership asset. It would seem that after the foreclosure and probably after the extension of the firm, the suits brought by Montilla in the local courts, to which we have previously referred, were decided against him; but in December, 1902, a new suit in the Porto Rican courts was by him \n\n[231 U.S. 601, 607]\n\u00a0\n commenced against Van Syckel individually and the firm of Van Syckel & Company and its members to rescind the lease and to vacate the foreclosure proceedings, and to recover the Santa Cruz property. Speaking generally, as to the lease, the ground of attack was that it was void for uncertainty, that the notarial declaration of Van Syckel as to the six-year term was unilateral and created no obligation, and that his reservation of future right to fix terms at his will was purely protestative and void for uncertainty. As to the mortgage debt, the assertion was that the transfer by which Van Syckel had acquired it, consequent on the decree of the provisional court, had extinguished the mortgage by payment, as no subrogation was expressed in the transfer or could, by operation of law, have resulted therefrom. In the meanwhile and before the extension of the partnership, Van Syckel removed from Porto Rico with his family to reside in Cuba, but left a power of attorney with his partners to carry on the business of the firm, he returning at intervals to Porto Rico to supervise and participate in the business. Subsequently, in leasing a portion or the Santa Cruz property, the lease was made to conform to the state of the public records, and therefore was so drawn as to pass not only the rights of the firm, but the right of Van Syckel under his apparently existing lease. In 1905, in conjunction with one English, the firm of Van Syckel & Company formed an agricultural partnership called the Santa Cruz Sugar Company, for the purpose of developing the sugar industry on the Santa Cruz property, and in that contract also the parties so acted as to make their agreement conform to the public records; that is, so as to recognize the lease apparently existing in the name of Van Syckel, as also the rights of the partnership in and to the property.\n During the interval, the suit last referred to, brought by Montilla, was decided against him in the lower court, and on his appeal in March, 1905, the judgment of the lower \n\n[231 U.S. 601, 608]\n\u00a0\n court was affirmed by the supreme court of Porto Rico, Montilla prosecuting an appeal to this court; but shortly thereafter the appeal was dismissed because of a compromise effected with Montilla by which the firm of Van Syckel & Company paid a small sum in cash, thus terminating the long controversy. Shortly prior, however, to this being done, Van Syckel died in Cuba, and the partnership having terminated not only as the result of his death, but by lapse of time, a controversy concerning the lease supervened and this suit followed.\n Dealing with the facts which we have recited and the other proof before it, the court found that the sale made by Van Syckel to the firm of Sobrinos de Ezquiaga consisted of one half the plant and assets of a dairy establishment and cattle farm by him carried on in part, at least, on the leased property, and chat not only as the result of implications necessarily arising from the provisions of the articles of partnership, but from the proof as to the situation of the parties and the manner in which they gave effect to the articles of partnership, it clearly resulted that the lease passed to the firm as a part and parcel of the contract by which the firm became the holder of the assets and plant.\n Thus the court said:\n'It is our opinion that Mr. Van Syckel sold a full half interest in his dairy business and all that constituted it, which included every right he had to all property concerned, for 15,000 pesos to respondents Sobrinos de Ezquiaga.' [4 Porto Rico Fed. Rep. 241].\n\n And again, speaking on the same subject:\n'We fail to see the force of the claim that Van Syckel put in a mere 'credit' or mortgage debt as an asset of this firm, the business of which was to carry on a dairy, and it looks ridiculous to say that these respondents simply invested in half of an interest-bearing mortgage. Van Syckel himself had been using this ranch for some time \n\n[231 U.S. 601, 609]\n\u00a0\n previous for this same purpose as a dairy ranch, and the firm continued to use it for the same purpose for some time thereafter. The firm could not ordinarily promote a dairy business by simply owning a mortgage which might be paid off any moment, so it seems to us to be plain that Van Syckel intended to include the possession which included the lease in the assets of the firm.'\n\n And this conclusion as to the ownership of the lease by the firm as the result of the formation of the partnership was reinforced by the following statements as to the conduct of the partners, their knowledge of the business, their participation therein, the accounts rendered concerning the same, and the profits distributed. The court said:\n'There is not a word of evidence in the case which shows that P. Van Syckel & Company ever paid any rent to Paul Van Syckel for this lease, or have ever given him any credit for any such rent, or that Van Syckel ever asked the firm to so give him credit for any rent, although it is in evidence that Sobrinos de Ezquiaga sent Van Syckel numerous statements of their accounts of the firm's business while he was then living in Cuba.'\n\n And again:\n'The overwhelming weight of the evidence in the case shows that Paul Van Syckel was just as prominent and even a much more active party than Sobrinos de lease of June 23, 1897. . . . attacks upon Montilla. A reading of the correspondence that is in the evidence will convince anyone of this.'\n\n Indeed, the conclusive effect of the comprehensive findings of the court concerning the ownership by the partnership of the alleged lease is fully illustrated by finding 14, a portion of which we quote, and finding 17.\n'14.\n\n'The said Paul Van Syckel during his lifetime agreed with Sobrinos de Ezquiaga by the terms of his partnership \n\n[231 U.S. 601, 610]\n\u00a0\n in the firm of P. Van Syckel & Company and otherwise, that said firm of P. Van Syckel & Company should be the sole and exclusive owners of the said farm 'Santa Cruz,' free and clear of any claims upon the part of said Paul Van Syckel by reason of said lease of June 23, 1897. . . .\n\n'17.\n\n'The evidence in this case is clear, unequivocal, and convincing that this lease of June 23, 1897, was to have no life or effect as between the parties in their accounting during or after the date of the partnership, but that the same was merged in the fee at the time of the adjudication thereof to said partnership of P. Van Syckel & Company, if not before.'\n\n Absolutely demonstrating, as these findings do, the want of merit in the contention that there was error in holding that the lease had no existence, if there was power to make and give effect to the finding, we come to consider those questions which, at the outset, we pointed out, are the only issues in the case.\n Passing whether the face of the notarial acts to which we have referred do not, in and of themselves, fully establish the transfer of the lease by Van Syckel to the firm, and its extinguishment by confusion as the result of the purchase at the foreclosure sale, but without intimating any opinion whatever to the contrary, let us consider the subject in a somewhat narrower aspect.\n Undoubtedly, under the local law (Laws of Porto Rico 1905, p. 73) if there was intrinsic ambiguity, the right to resort to extraneous proof to dispel it obtained; that is, proof, to use the words of  28 of the statute, showing 'the circumstances under which it (the document or contract) was made, including the situation of the subject of the instrument, and of the parties to it . . . so that the judge be placed in the position of those whose language he is to interpret.' \n\n[231 U.S. 601, 611]\n\u00a0\n Was there, then, such ambiguity in the articles of partnership concerning the method of carrying on the business for which the partnership was organized as to justify the admission of explanatory proof?\n The articles leave no doubt concerning what the business of the partnership was to be; that is, the carrying on of a dairy and the purchase of cattle; but there is nothing in the articles which expressly shows where and how the proposed business of the firm was to be conducted, and when light on this subject is sought from the implications of the text, to say the least, such a state of mental uncertainty is engendered as plainly justifies the resort to proof to clear up the ambiguity. We say this because in the first place the property, one half of which was bought from Van Syckel by Sobrinos de Ezquiaga, and the whole of which was then put by the joint owners into the firm as its sole capital in trade, on the face of the paper appeared to be an inventory of the assets and property of a pre-existing business, which, from the nature and character of a large part of the tangible property sold, was a dairy and cattle business. In the second place because, included in the articles bought, was a sum of money stated to be 'value of working capital,' which so persuasively suggests the present purpose to continue an existing business as beyond all doubt to justify proof as to the situation of the parties and of the subject-matter to which the contract related. The proof, then, being admissible and establishing that Van Syckel was engaged in a dairy and cattle business upon the Santa Cruz property, and that the assets and capital, one half of which he sold, constituted the plant and assets of such business, which the firm continued to conduct, the question is, Was there such ambiguity in the contract as to the transfer of the lease as to again justify proof beyond the terms of the instrument to clean up that situation? Of this also we think there can be no doubt, for the following reason: The inclusion among the \n\n[231 U.S. 601, 612]\n\u00a0\n transferred assets of the debt secured by mortgage upon the Santa Cruz property, and the dominancy of that debt as to the lease, in and of itself creates obscurity as to whether, by the transfer of the paramount right, it was not contemplated to also pass to the firm the subordinate lease right, and that ambiguity becomes more apparent when it is considered that the established business was carried on by means of the Santa Cruz property, and that possession of that property was necessarily a prerequisite to the continued conduct of the business. Indeed, this ambiguity becomes all the more marked when it is borne in mind that the interdependence of the lease and the mortgage was so great that the judicial power had compelled a transfer to Van Syckel of the mortgage because he was the owner of the lease. Certainly, as the possession of the Santa Cruz property for the purpose of the business was essential, and that possession could only be enjoyed by the firm as a consequence of the right to the lease or the rights to be possibly acquired as the result of the foreclosure of the mortgage, the inquiry as to whether one or both rights were intended to be embraced was essential to a comprehension of the contract, and its solution was made so ambiguous by particular provisions of the contract as to justify proof for its clarification. This arises from the provision requiring the transfer of the mortgage to a third person by legal subrogation in the event Montilla should so exact. The resulting ambiguity is apparent since in such event, unless the mortgage was subordinated by agreement or by operation of law to the lease, the destruction or impairment of the rights which it was the obvious intention of the partnership to create becomes self-evident. So, also, unless the firm owned the lease, it would have no interest to subordinate the mortgage to the lease, and in the event the right of legal subrogation was exercised and the mortgage, by operation of law, passed to a third person, such person, unless the partnership \n\n[231 U.S. 601, 613]\n\u00a0\n owned the lease, would hold the mortgage as paramount to the lease, and therefore have the power to destroy it. Indeed, the duty to admit the proof, we think, would equally result if attention be not confined to the articles of partnership, but be extended to those articles in conjunction with 'the postponement agreement,' the foreclosure sale, the extension of the partnership, and the other notarial documents to which we have referred. But we do not deem it necessary to elaborate this view, as what we have said is adequate to demonstrate the want of merit in the contention that the controlling findings of fact made by the court below were, as a matter of law, void because of a want of power in the court to consider the proof upon which the findings were based.\n This leaves only for consideration the contention that the action of the court was erroneous because it gave effect to fraud and deceit, and enabled the defendants to recover by alleging their own turpitude. Before we approach that subject, however, we dispose of another matter to which considerable attention was devoted in the argument at bar.\n During the course of the trial Senor Vacuna, who had been the attorney of Sobrinos de Ezquiaga, of Van Syckel, and of the partnership, was offered as a witness to prove that 'the postponement agreement' was advised by him and was executed as a mere precautionary measure to protect the interest of the firm in the lease; that is, to preserve the lease in case, by an adverse decision in the Montilla suits, the foreclosure proceedings were annulled and the firm deprived of its resulting ownership of the property. In other words, that the purpose was to leave the lease in such a position upon the public records that if it should result from the Montilla suits that the title resting upon the foreclosure was destroyed, the lease would not be treated as having been extinguished by confusion because on the records the ownership of the property and \n\n[231 U.S. 601, 614]\n\u00a0\n the ownership of the lease had been in one and the same person. The court heard the witness over objection based upon the privileged character of the matter sought to be proved, and the form in which it was attempted to be elicited. But we do not think we need consider the subject because we are clearly of opinion, in view of the findings of the court concerning the sale of the lease to the partnership and its other findings of fact, that it is wholly immaterial to pass upon the objection because, even if it be assumed, for argument's sake, to have been well taken, prejudicial error under the circumstances did not result. The weight of the contention as to deceit, fraud, and wrongdoing is placed upon the postponement agreement, but, in view of the ownership by the partnership of the lease and the fact that Van Syckel, although he had disposed of the lease, still remained upon the public records as its owner, we fail to perceive the slightest foundation for the contention as to fraud or wrong or deceit, resulting from the postponement agreement, as applied to those who were parties to it. As the holder of both the lease and the mortgage, the firm had the right to seek to prevent the destruction of the one right by the enforcement of the other,-a destruction which would have been threatened by a resort to foreclosure if the agreement to postpone the mortgage to the lease had not been put upon the records. This is obvious for this reason: If, upon the records, the mortgage had continued to occupy a dominant position as to the lease, it would have resulted that the lease would have been extinguished by a sale to foreclose the mortgage; and therefore, if at such a sale, a third person had bought the mortgaged property, such purchaser would have taken the property free from the lease, and the firm, by the act of enforcing its mortgage, would necessarily have extinguished its lease. Under these circumstances there is no ground for charging fraud and wrongdoing, simply because the parties sought in a lawful mode to protect their legal rights. \n\n[231 U.S. 601, 615]\n\u00a0\n In its last analysis the whole argument rests upon the assumption that because the parties to the contracts did not change the public records so as to cause them to conform to their contracts, they lost the right as between themselves to enforce their contract obligations,-a proposition which is refuted by its mere statement. Looking at all the transactions from first to last,-the silence of the articles of partnership as to the lease, the act of postponement, the foreclosure proceedings, the extension of the partnership, and the subsequent dealings, we can discover no ground by which it can be justly said that the parties were guilty of wrongdoing. The existence of the Montilla suits assailing the title to the property as well as the validity of the lease suffices to explain the constant purpose to retain on the public records divergent ownership of the two-when in fact they were united in one person-lest the loss of one, the title, might carry with it by confusion the loss of the other, the lease, because both had been on the record in the name of the same person. Admitting that if the title had been vacated, the benignity of the law, by the application of the principle of restitutio in integrum would have prevented the loss of the lease by confusion, and therefore the fear of the partners was unnecessary, that fact does not justify treating them as wrongdoers or characterizing their acts as fraudulent.\n Indeed, when it is considered that the controversy is between partners, and concerns acts in which they all bore an equal part, and that the charge of fraud is advanced to sustain the asserted right of one partner to recover, to the detriment of the other partners, property which he sold to the partnership, and for which he was paid without a return of the price, the want of merit in the contention becomes apparent.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","271":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVIRGINIA v.

Archer, in support of the motion.\n Messrs. William A. Anderson, Randolph Harrison, John B. Moon, and Mr. John Garland Pollard, Attorney General of Virginia, opposed.\n Messrs. Sanford Robinson and Holmes Conrad also apposed.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case, which was begun in 1906, was elaborately argued in 1907 on a demurrer, which was overruled. \n206 U.S. 290\n, 51 L. ed. 1068, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 732. It was again argued in 1908 on a motion to appoint a master. \n209 U.S. 514\n, 52 L. ed. 914, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 614. Before that officer there was an extended hearing, and a full report of all the matters involved was filed in March, 1910. It was then argued on a motion to take further testimony, and was ultimately heard in an argument which extended many \n\n[234 U.S. 117, 119]\n\u00a0\n days, every party in interest being represented, in the month of January, 1911\n\n\n Notwithstanding these facts, when in March, 1911, the court came to decide the controversy, although it fully reviewed and passed upon the fundamental issues, as its obvious duty required it to do, and fixed the principal sum due by the state of West Virginia to the state of Virginia, in view of the consideration due to the parties as states, and that the cause was, as then said, 'no ordinary commercial suit, but, . . . a quasi- international difference referred to this court in reliance upon the honor and constitutional obligations of the states concerned rather than upon ordinary remedies,' the controversy was not completely and irrevocably disposed of, but was left open for a time not specified, to the end that any clerical errors that might have crept into the calculations of the sums due could be corrected, and to give the states time to consider the subject of liability for interest in the light of what had been decided, and to agree as to the rate and period of the interest to be paid on the principal sum which was determined. \n220 U.S. 1\n, 55 L. ed. 353, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 330.\n On the convening of the court in the following October, 1911, a motion was made on behalf of the state of Virginia to proceed at once to a final decree. Listening to the suggestion of the state of West Virginia to the effect that it desired further time to consider the subject, and in view of the public considerations which had prevailed when the decree was entered, the motion of Virginia was overruled. \n222 U.S. 17\n, 56 L. ed. 71, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 4.\n Yet further, when, in November, 1913, another motion on the part of Virginia was made to set the case down to be finally disposed of at once upon the statement that no agreement between the parties was possible, again giving heed to the request of West Virginia, through its constituted officers, for a postponement for a stated time, and to the statement that they were engaged in an honest en- \n\n[234 U.S. 117, 120]\n\u00a0\n deavor to deal with the controversy, and, if possible, to come to an agreement as to the subjects left open, the motion of Virginia was again refused (\n231 U.S. 89\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 29), and as it was possible to give to the state of West Virginia all the time which that state, in resisting the motion, asked, and yet secure against the possibility of the hearing being carried over to another term, the case was assigned for hearing on the 13th of April of this year. When that day was reached, the state of West Virginia, in accord with a motion filed some days before, prayed leave to be permitted to file a supplemental answer asserting the existence of credits which, if properly considered, would materially reduce the sum fixed as due to the state of Virginia, the said answer in addition asserting various grounds why interest should not be allowed in favor of Virginia and against West Virginia on the sum due. Resisting this request, the state of Virginia insists that the items embraced in the supplemental answer asked to be filed had in effect already entered into the considerations by which the principal sum due was fixed, and that if not, the case should not be postponed for the purpose of permitting the rights urged in the answer to be availed of because every item concerning such alleged rights was proved in the case before the master, was mentioned in his report, and was known or could have been known by the use of ordinary diligence by those representing West Virginia. And it is this controversy we now come to dispose of.\n Without intimating any opinion whatever as to whether the items with which the proposed supplemental answer deals entered into the processes of calculation or reasoning by which the sum due was previously fixed, and moreover, without intimating any opinion as to how far the items embraced in the answer could serve as credits upon the sum previously found due, and therefore to that extent reduce the amount, we think it is obvious that most of the \n\n[234 U.S. 117, 121]\n\u00a0\n items embraced in the answer were contained in the master's report, and in any event all were available then for every defense now based upon them if their consideration had been pressed in the aspect and with the assertions of right now made.\n The question then is, Under these conditions ought the permission to file the supplemental answer be granted? We think it must be conceded that in a case between ordinary litigants the application of the ordinary rules of legal procedure would render it impossible, under the circumstances which we have stated, to grant the request. We are of the opinion, however, that such concession ought not to be here controlling. As we have pointed out, in acting in this case from first to last the fact that the suit was not an ordinary one concerning a difference between individuals, but was a controversy between states, involving grave questions of public law, determinable by this court under the exceptional grant of power conferred upon it by the Constitution, has been the guide by which every step and every conclusion hitherto expressed has been controlled. And we are of the opinion that this guiding principle should not now be lost sight of, to the end that when the case comes ultimately to be finally and irrevocably disposed of, as come ultimately it must, in the absence of agreement between the parties, there may be no room for the slightest inference that the more restricted rules applicable to individuals have been applied to a great public controversy, or that anything but the largest justice, after the amplest opportunity to be heard, has in any degree entered into the disposition of the case. This conclusion, which we think is required by the duty owed to the moving state, also in our opinion operates no injustice to the opposing state, since it but affords an additional opportunity to guard against the possibility of error, and thus reach the result most consonant with the honor and dignity of both parties to the controversy. \n\n[234 U.S. 117, 122]\n\u00a0\n Because of these convictions, we therefore make the following order:\n That the motion on the part of the state of West Virginia to file the supplemental answer be and the same is hereby granted; and that the averments in such answer be and the same shall be considered as traversed by the state of Virginia; that the subject-mater of the supplemental answer as traversed be at once referred for consideration and report to Charles E. Littlefield, Esq., the master before whom the previous hearings were had, with directions to hear and consider such evidence and testimony as to the matters set forth in the supplemental answer as the state of West Virginia may deem advisable to proffer, and such counter showing on the part of the state of Virginia as that state may deem advisable to make. The report on the subject to embrace the testimony so taken and the conclusions deduced therefrom, as well as the views of the master concerning the operation and effect of the proof thus offered, if any, upon the principal sum found to be due by the previous decree of this court. Nothing in this order to vacate or change in any manner or in any particular the previous decree, and the same to stand wholly unaffected by the order now made or any action taken thereunder until the examination and report herein provided for is made and this court acts upon the same. It is further directed that the proceedings before the master be so conducted as to secure a report on or before the 2d Monday of October, 1914. \n\n\n\n","272":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWABASH R. CO. v. HAYES(1914)\nNo. 843\nArgued: Decided: May 25, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 86, 87]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. L. Minnis, John Maxey zane, and charles F. Morse for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. James C. McShane for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[234 U.S. 86, 88]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was an action against a railroad company to recover for a personal injury sustained by the plaintiff through the negligence of the company while he was employed as a switchman in its railroad yard in Cook county, Illinois. The action was brought in the superior court of that county, and a trial to the court and a jury resulted in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff. The judgment was affirmed by the appellate court for that district (180 Ill. App. 511), which was the highest court of the state in which a decision of the case could be had, and this writ of error was then sued out by the company. By a motion to dismiss the writ our jurisdiction to review the judgment is challenged. Shortly stated, the facts bearing upon the disposition of the motion are these:\n The plaintiff's declaration alleged that the injury occurred while the defendant was engaged, and while the plaintiff was employed by it, in interstate commerce. The \n\n[234 U.S. 86, 89]\n\u00a0\n other allegations were such that, with that one, they stated a good cause of action under the Federal employers' liability act (35 Stat. at L. 65, chap. 149, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1322), and, without it, they stated a good cause of action under the common law prevailing in the state. There was a plea of not guilty; and upon the trial, the proof failing to show that the injury occurred in interstate commerce, the court, at the defendant's request, instructed the jury that the Federal employers' liability act had no application to the case. Then, over the defendant's objection, the court treated the allegation respecting interstate commerce as eliminated, and submitted the case to the jury as one controlled by the common law prevailing in the state. The plaintiff recovered under that law. In the appellate court the defendant contended that, even though the allegation that the injury occurred in interstate commerce proved unwarranted, the declaration could not be treated, consistently with the Federal act, as affording any basis for a recovery under the law of the state, common or statutory. But the court held otherwise and sustained the recovery under the state law. Whether that ruling operated as a denial of a right or immunity to which the defendant was entitled under the Federal act is the question, and the only question, sought to be presented by the assignments of error.\n Had the injury occurred in interstate commerce, as was alleged, the Federal act undoubtedly would have been controlling, and a recovery could not have been had under the common or statute law of the state; in other words, the Federal act would have been exclusive in its operation, not merely cumulative. Second Employers' Liability Cases (Mondou v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co.) \n223 U.S. 1\n, 53-55, 56 L. ed. 327, 347, 348, 38 L.R.A.( N.S.) 44, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 169, 1 N. C. C. A. 875; St. Louis, S.

Rep. 305; Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Horton, \n233 U.S. 492\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 635. On the other hand, if the injury occurred outside of interstate \n\n[234 U.S. 86, 90]\n\u00a0\n commerce, the Federal act was without application, and the law of the state was controlling. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Behrens, \n233 U.S. 473\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 646. That the injury did occur outside of interstate commerce was declared in the court's instruction to the jury, and the defendant, having requested the instruction, is bound by it. It therefore must be taken as settled that the right of recovery arose under the state law.\n The plaintiff asserted only one right to recover for the injury, and in the nature of things he could have but one. Whether it arose under the Federal act or under the state law, it was equally cognizable in the state court; and had it been presented in an alternative way in separate counts, one containing and another omitting the allegation that the injury occurred in interstate commerce, the propriety of proceeding to a judgment under the latter count, after it appeared that the first could not be sustained, doubtless would have been freely conceded. Certainly, nothing in the Federal act would have been in the way.\n Instead of presenting his case in an alternative way, the plaintiff so stated it as to indicate that he was claiming only under the Federal act. And when the proofs demonstrated that the injury arose outside of interstate commerce, and therefore that no recovery could be had under the Federal act, the court was confronted with the question whether the declaration could be amended, or regarded as amended, to conform to the proofs. Holding that this could be done, the court treated the mistaken allegation that the injury occurred in interstate commerce as eliminated. Therein the court merely gave effect to a rule of local practice, the application of which was not in anywise in contravention of the Federal act. See Second Employers' Liability Cases (Mondou v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co.) \n223 \nU.S. 56, 57\n, 56 S. L. ed. 348, 349, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 44, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 169, 1 N. C. C. A. 875.\n It follows that the contention that the defendant was denied a right or immunity to which it was entitled under \n\n[234 U.S. 86, 91]\n\u00a0\n the Federal act is not only untenable, but so devoid of color as to furnish no basis for this writ of error. See Sawyer v. Piper, \n189 U.S. 154\n, 47 L. ed. 757, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 633.\n As it is not claimed that, by reason of the shifting from one law to the other, the defendant was cut off from presenting any defense which was open only under the latter, or that the course taken by the plaintiff deprived the defendant of a right of removal otherwise existing, we intimate no opinion in either connection.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","273":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWASHINGTON SECURITIES CO. v.

Clise, Charles Kennedy Poe, and Charles Poe for appellant.\n Assistant Attorney General Knaebel for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was a suit to cancel four patents issued under the commutation provision of the homestead law, and embracing a full section of land in King county, Washington. The bill charged that the patents were fraudulently procured by falsely representing to the land officers that the lands were agricultural in character, and therefore subject to homestead entry, when in truth they were at the time known to be valuable coal lands, and therefore excepted from the operation of the homestead law. After the patents were issued the lands were conveyed to the appellant, and there was a further charge that it took the title with notice and knowledge of the fraud. The circuit court found that these charges were true, and entered \n\n[234 U.S. 76, 78]\n\u00a0\n a decree for the government; and the circuit court of appeals, taking a like view of the evidence, affirmed the decree. 114 C.

Rep. 438. Applying the rule to the evidence in this case, we think the findings below should not be disturbed.\n Only two of appellant's contentions merit special notice.\n Without any uncertainty the evidence demonstrated that the lands were known to be valuable coal lands when the homestead entries were made and commuted, and that the affidavits and proofs to the contrary, upon which the patents were procured, were false. Not only were the lands in a well- known coal region and generally reputed to be coal lands, but a tunnel, slope, and other openings upon them, costing about $8,000, had disclosed that they contained coal of such quality and quantity as to render them valuable for coal mining. The entrymen so understood, and resorted to severe measures to keep coal prospectors off the lands.\n The appellant's chief contention is, that there was no evidence, or, at least, no substantial evidence, that it took the title with notice or knowledge of the fraud perpetrated by the entrymen. But the record shows otherwise. The appellant's vice president, who represented it in the negotiations, had theretofore, as agent of another company, learned that the latter was interested in the coal development work before mentioned, and was, with others, bearing the expense of that work with a view to acquiring the lands as coal lands. This was recalled to his mind at the time of the negotiations. He caused the section to be \n\n[234 U.S. 76, 79]\n\u00a0\n examined by an engineer, who found and reported the tunnel and other openings disclosing the coal, and, following that report, the transaction was consummated on the theory that the lands were valuable for their coal contents. There was no claim that there was any development work or coal discovery after the entries were made, and it is quite apparent from what was said of the engineer's report that the tunnel and openings gave visible evidence that they were not recently made. Of course, the appellant was bound to take notice that the patentees with whom it was dealing had obtained the lands under the homestead law, for it was so recited in the patents. Simmons Creek Coal Co. v. Doran, \n142 \nU.S. 417, 437\n, 35 S. L. ed. 1063, 1071, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 239. In these facts there was, as we think, persuasive evidence that the appellant took the title with notice or knowledge of the fraud.\n It is contended also that the proceedings resulting in the patents were not ex parte, but adversary; that the land officers found the lands to be agricultural in character, and that this finding was conclusive upon the government. No doubt those officers found from the proofs submitted to them that the lands were agricultural, and not coal lands, for that was a prerequisite to issuing the patents, but the proceedings were not adversary in any true sense of the term. The applications and proofs of the entrymen were strictly ex parte. The government was not called upon to make any adverse showing, no issue was framed, no hearing was had, and no one represented the government save in the sense that the land officers did so. As this court has often held, the finding of the land officers in such a proceeding, although not open to collateral attack, is not conclusive against the government when it sues to cancel the resulting patent upon the ground that it was obtained by means of false and fraudulent proofs. United States v. Minor, \n114 U.S. 233\n, 29 L. ed. 110, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 836; J. J. McCaskill Co. v. United States, \n216 \nU.S. 504, 509\n, 54 S. L. ed. 590, 594, 30 Sup. Ct.

In such \n\n[234 U.S. 76, 80]\n\u00a0\n a suit the action of the land officers is given appropriate effect by treating it as presumptively right, and as requiring the government to carry the burden of proving the fraud by the class of evidence which commands respect, and that amount of it which produces conviction.

MILLER(1914)\nNo. 53\nArgued: Decided: December 14, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 422, 423]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Lewis C. Lawson for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Nathan A. Gibson for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n This was a suit to quiet the title to lands within what until recently was the Creek Nation in the Indian Territory. The lands were allotted to an enrolled Creek, who died intestate November 3, 1907, after receiving the usual tribal deeds approved by the Secretary of the Interior. He left no widow or descendant, but was survived by his father and mother, two half brothers and a half sister on the paternal side, and a half sister on the maternal side. The father was an enrolled Seminole and the mother an enrolled Creek. The half brothers and half sister on the paternal side were Seminoles and the half sister on the maternal side was a Creek. The plaintiff in the suit was in possession and claimed under a deed from the mother, executed July 16, 1909, and approved by the county \n\n[235 U.S. 422, 424]\n\u00a0\n court. See United States v. Knight, 124 C. C. A. 211, 206 Fed. 145. The father was a defendant and by his answer admitted the facts here stated, and insisted that, although not a Creek citizen, he was an heir of the deceased allottee, and as such had an interest in the lands. Upon this answer a judgment was given against him, which was affirmed by the supreme court of the state. 34 Okla. 259, 129 Pac. 58. He then sued out this writ of error.\n The ultimate question for decision is whether the father was an heir, and that involves an ascertainment and interpretation of the applicable law of descent.\n The allotment was made and the tribal deeds were issued under the act of March 1, 1901 (31 Stat. at L. 861, chap. 676), known as the original Creek agreement, and the modifying act of June 30, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 500, chap. 1323), known as the supplemental Creek agreement.\n Before coming to the provisions of those acts, it may be helpful to refer to the situation existing at the time of their enactment. Long prior thereto the Creek Nation had adopted laws of its own regulating the descent and distribution of property of its citizens dying intestate. Creek Laws of 1867,  6; Perryman's Compiled Creek Laws of 1890,  6, p. 32,  8, p. 76; Bledsoe's Indian Land Laws, 2d ed.  829-831. Congress also had dealt with that subject. By the act of May 2, 1890 (26 Stat. at L. 81, chap. 182),  30 and 31, it had 'extended over and put in force in the Indian Territory' several general laws of the state of Arkansas, among which was chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest of 1884, relating to descent and distribution. At first the operation of this act was materially restricted by a proviso declaring that 'the judicial tribunals of the Indian nations shall retain exclusive jurisdiction in all civil and criminal cases arising in the country in which members of the nation by nativity or by adoption shall be the only parties; and as to all such cases the laws of the state of Arkansas extended over and put in force in said Indian \n\n[235 U.S. 422, 425]\n\u00a0\n Territory by this act shall not apply.' But the proviso lost much of its force when the act of June 7, 1897 (30 Stat. at L. 83, chap. 3), declared that 'the laws of the United States and the state of Arkansas in force in the [Indian] Territory shall apply to all persons therein, irrespective of race,' and was practically abrogated when the act of June 28, 1898 (30 Stat. at L. 495, chap. 517), abolished all tribal courts in the Indian Territory ( 28) and provided ( 26) that 'the laws of the various tribes or nations of Indians shall not be enforced at law or in equity by the courts of the United States in the Indian Territory.' Of course, these congressional enactments operated to displace the Creek tribal laws of descent and distribution, and to substitute in their stead the Arkansas law as expressed in chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest.\n Notwithstanding the situation just mentioned, provisions were inserted in the original Creek agreement of March 1, 1901, supra, which undoubtedly gave controlling effect to the Creek tribal laws rather than to the Arkansas law; and those provisions embraced allotments to living citizens as well as allotments on behalf of deceased citizens. Thus in  7 it was provided that if, after a homestead had served the purposes of its creation, the allottee should die intestate, the land should 'descend to his heirs according to the laws of descent and distribution of the Creek Nation;' and in  28 it was provided that, if a citizen or child entitled to enrolment should die before receiving his allotment and share of the funds of the tribe, the lands and money to which he would be entitled, if living, should 'descend to his heirs according to the laws of descent and distribution of the Creek Nation.' In other parts of the agreement the word 'heirs' was used without any accompanying explanation of who was intended, but this evidently was because the word was intended to have the same signification as in  7 and 28, and therefore no further explanation was necessary. \n\n[235 U.S. 422, 426]\n\u00a0\n But the purpose to give effect to the Creek tribal laws was soon changed, for the act of May 27, 1902 (32 Stat. at L. 258, chap. 888), not only expressly repealed so much of the act or agreement of March 1, 1901, as provided for descent and distribution according to the Creek tribal laws, but also declared: 'And the descent and distribution of lands and moneys provided for in said act shall be in accordance with the provisions of chapter forty-nine of Mansfield's Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas in force in Indian Territory.' A little more than a month later what was said in the act of May 27, 1902, was repeated in  6 of the supplemental Creek agreement of June 30, 1902, and was there qualified by two provisos which have an important bearing here. That section reads:\n'The provisions of the act of Congress approved March 1, 1901 (31 Stat. at L. 861, chap. 676), in so far as they provide for descent and distribution according to the laws of the Creek Nation, are hereby repealed and the descent and distribution of land and money provided for by said act shall be in accordance with chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest of the Statutes of Arkansas now in force in Indian Territory: Provided, That only citizens of the Creek Nation, male and female, and their Creek descendants, shall inherit lands of the Creek Nation: And provided further, That if there be no person of Creek citizenship to take the descent and distribution of said estate, then the inheritance shall go to noncitizen heirs in the order named in said chapter 49.'\n\n Applying this section to the facts of this case, the supreme court of the state held that the father, although an heir according to chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest, was excluded by the two provisos from the right to inherit, because he was not a Creek citizen, and the mother, who was such citizen, had an inheritable status according to that chapter.\n The first contention requiring consideration is that the two provisos do not affect the right to inherit from one \n\n[235 U.S. 422, 427]\n\u00a0\n who dies after receiving his allotment, but only the right to receive lands from the tribe in place of one who was entitled to an allotment and died before receiving it. The contention rests upon the words 'lands of the Creek Nation' in the first proviso, and is sought to be sustained upon the theory that lands which have been allotted and passed into private ownership are no longer lands of the tribe, and therefore not within the provisos. We think the words indicated were merely descriptive of the body of lands which where being allotted in severalty and subjected to the incidents of individual ownership; that is, the lands in the Creek Nation.\n In that sense they would include the lands as well after allotment as before. The section as a whole shows that it looked to the future no less than to the present, and was intended to prescribe rules of descent applicable to all Creek allotments. Nothing in the provisos indicates that they were to be less comprehensive. Their purpose was to give Creek citizens and their Creek descendants a perferred right to inherit, and no reason is perceived for giving such a preference where a citizen entitled to an allotment died before receiving it that would not be equally applicable if he had died after it was received. We conclude, therefore, that the contention is not well founded.\n It next is insisted that the two provisos were repealed by a provision in the act of April 28, 1904 (33 Stat. at L. 573, chap. 1824), reading as follows:\n'All the laws of Arkansas heretofore put in force in the Indian Territory are hereby continued and extended in their operation so as to embrace all persons and estates in said Territory, whether Indian, freedmen, or otherwise, . . .'\n\n No repealing clause accompanied this provision, so the question is, did it repeal the provisos by implication? There is no doubt that, if taken literally, it would subject the Creek lands to the Arkansas law of descent and dis- \n\n[235 U.S. 422, 428]\n\u00a0\n tribution without any qualification or restriction. But this would be only by reason of the generality of its terms, for it made no mention of that law or of those lands. In short, it was plainly a general statute, and did not show that the attention of Congress was then particularly directed to the descent of the lands of the Creeks. On the other hand,  6 of the supplemental agreement and its two provisos dealt with that subject in specific and positive terms which made it certain that the Creeks and their lands were particularly in mind at the time. In these circumstances we think there was no implied repeal, and for these reasons: First, such repeals are not favored, and usually occur only where there is such an irreconcilable conflict between an earlier and a later statute that effect reasonably cannot be given to both (United States v. Healey, \n160 \nU.S. 136, 146\n, 40 S. L. ed. 369, 373, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 247; United States v. Greathouse, \n166 \nU.S. 601, 605\n, 41 S. L. ed. 1130, 1131, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 701); second, where there are two statutes upon the same subject, the earlier being special and the later general, the presumption is, in the absence of an express repeal, or an absolue incompatibility, that the special is intended to remain in force as an exception to the general (Townsend v. Little, \n109 \nU.S. 504, 512\n, 27 S. L. ed. 1012, 1015, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 357; Ex parte Crow Dog [Ex parte Kaug Gi-Shin-Ca] \n109 \nU.S. 556, 570\n, 27 S. L. ed. 1030, 1035, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 396; Rogers v. United States, \n185 U.S. 83\n, 87- 89, 46 L. ed. 816, 818, 819, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 582); and, third, there was in this instance no irreconcilable conflict or absolute incompatibility, for both statutes could be given reasonable operation if the presumption just named were recognized.\n No doubt there was a purpose to extend the operation of the Arkansas laws in various ways, but we think it was not intended that they should supersede or displace special statutory provisions enacted by Congress with particular regard for the Indians, whose affairs were peculiarly within its control. Taylor v. Parker, \n235 U.S. 42\n, 59 L. ed. --, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 22. See also Re Davis, 32 Okla. 209, 122 Pac. 547.\n In the briefs there is considerable discussion of the question whether the mother, through whom the plaintiff \n\n[235 U.S. 422, 429]\n\u00a0\n claimed, took the fee simple or only a life estate; but as the judgment against the father was amply sustained in either event, that question need not be considered.\n The allegations and admissions in one part of the defendant's answer were held to overcome the denials in another, and complaint is made of this; but, as it appears that nothing more than a question of local pleading and practice was involved, the ruling is not open to review in this court.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","275":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWEEKS v. U.S.(1914)\nNo. 461\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 383, 384]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Martin J. O'Donnell for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 383, 385]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Denison and Solicitor General Davis for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 383, 386]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Day delivered the opinion of the court:\n An indictment was returned against the plaintiff in error, defendant below, and herein so designated, in the district court of the United States for the western district of Missouri, containing nine counts. The seventh count, upon which a conviction was had, charged the use of the mails for the purpose of transporting certain coupons or tickets representing chances or shares in a lottery or gift enterprise, in violation of  213 of the Criminal Code [35 Stat. at L. 1129, chap. 321, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 1652]. Sentence of fine and imprisonment was imposed. This writ of error is to review that judgment.\n The defendant was arrested by a police officer, so far as the record shows, without warrant, at the Union Station in Kansas City, Missouri, where he was employed by an express company. Other police officers had gone to the house of the defendant, and being told by a neighbor where the key was kept, found it and entered the house. They searched the defendant's room and took possession of various papers and articles found there, which were afterwards turned over to the United States marshal. Later in the same day police officers returned with the marshal, who thought he might find additional evidence, and, being admitted by someone in the house, probably a boarder, in response to a rap, the marshal searched the defendant's room and carried away certain letters and envelops found in the drawer of a chiffonier. Neither the marshal nor the police officer had a search warrant. \n\n[232 U.S. 383, 387]\n\u00a0\n The defendant filed in the cause before the time for trial the following petition:\n Petition to Return Private Papers, Books, and Other Property.\n Now comes defendant and states that he is a citizen and resident of Kansas City, Missouri, and that he resides, owns, and occupies a home at 1834 Penn street in said city:\n That on the 21st day of December, 1911, while plaintiff was absent at his daily vocation, certain officers of the government whose names are to plaintiff unknown, unlawfully and without warrant or authority so to do, broke open the door to plaintiff's said home and seized all of his books, letters, money, papers, notes, evidences of indebtedness, stock, certificates, insurance policies, deeds, abstracts, and other muniments of title, bonds, candies, clothes, and other property in said home, and this in violation of  11 and 23 to the Constitution of Missouri, and of the 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States;\n That the district attorney, marshal, and clerk of the United States court for the western district of Missouri took the above-described property so seized into their possession, and have failed and refused to return to defendant portion of same, to wit:\n One (1) leather grip, value about $7; one (1) tin box valued at $3; one (1) Pettis county, Missouri, bond, value $500; three (3) mining stock certificates which defendant is unable to more particularly describe, valued at $12,000; and certain stock certificates in addition thereto, issued by the San Domingo Mining, Loan, & Investment Company; about $75 in currency; one (1) newspaper published about 1790, an heirloom; and certain other property which plaintiff is now unable to describe.\n That said property is being unlawfully and improperly \n\n[232 U.S. 383, 388]\n\u00a0\n held by said district attorney, marshal, and clerk, in violation of defendant's rights under the Constitution of the United States and the state of Missouri.\n That said district attorney purposes to use said books, letters, papers, certificates of stock, etc., at the trial of the above-entitled cause, and that by reason thereof and of the facts above set forth defendant's rights under the amendments aforesaid to the Constitution of Missouri and the United States have been and will be violated unless the court order the return prayed for;\n Wherefore, defendant prays that said district attorney, marshal, and clerk be notified, and that the court direct and order said district attorney, marshal, and clerk, to return said property to said defendant.\n Upon consideration of the petition the court entered in the cause an order directing the return of such property as was not pertinent to the charge against the defendant, but denied the petition as to pertinent matter, reserving the right to pass upon the pertinency at a later time. In obedience to the order the district attorney returned part of the property taken, and retained the remainder, concluding a list of the latter with the statement that, 'all of which last above described property is to be used in evidence in the trial of the above-entitled cause, and pertains to the alleged sale of lottery tickets of the company above named.'\n After the jury had been sworn and before any evidence had been given, the defendant again urged his petition for the return of his property, which was denied by the court. Upon the introduction of such papers during the trial, the defendant objected on the ground that the papers had been obtained without a search warrant, and by breaking open his home, in violation of the 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, which objection was overruled by the court. Among the papers retained and put in evidence were a number of \n\n[232 U.S. 383, 389]\n\u00a0\n lottery tickets and statements with reference to the lottery, taken at the first visit of the police to the defendant's room, and a number of letters written to the defendant in respect to the lottery, taken by the marshal upon his search of defendant's room.\n The defendant assigns error, among other things, in the court's refusal to grant his petition for the return of his property, and in permitting the papers to be used at the trial.\n It is thus apparent that the question presented involves the determination of the duty of the court with reference to the motion made by the defendant for the return of certain letters, as well as other papers, taken from his room by the United States marshal, who, without authority of process, if any such could have been legally issued, visited the room of the defendant for the declared purpose of obtaining additional testimony to support the charge against the accused, and, having gained admission to the house, took from the drawer of a chiffonier there found certain letters written to the defendant, tending to show his guilt. These letters were placed in the control of the district attorney, and were subsequently produced by him and offered in evidence against the accused at the trial. The defendant contends that such appropriation of his private correspondence was in violation of rights secured to him by the 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. We shall deal with the 4th Amendment, which provides:\n'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.'\n\n The history of this Amendment is given with particularity in the opinion of Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for \n\n[232 U.S. 383, 390]\n\u00a0\n the court in Boyd v. United States, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 29 L. ed. 746, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 524. As was there shown, it took its origin in the determination of the framers of the Amendments to the Federal Constitution to provide for that instrument a Bill of Rights, securing to the American people, among other things, those safeguards which had grown up in England to protect the people from unreasonable searches and seizures, such as were permitted under the general warrants issued under authority of the government, by which there had been invasions of the home and privacy of the citizens, and the seizure of their private papers in support of charges, real or imaginary, make against them. Such practices had also received sanction under warrants and seizures under the so-called writs of assistance, issued in the American colonies. See 2 Watson, Const. 1414 et seq. Resistance to these practices had established the principle which was enacted into the fundamental law in the 4th Amendment, that a man's house was his castle, and not to be invaded by any general authority to search and seize his goods and papers. Judge Cooley, in his Constitutional Limitations, pp. 425, 426, in treating of this feature of our Constitution said: 'The maxim that 'every man's house is his castle' is made a part of our constitutional law in the clauses prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures, and has always been looked upon as of high value to the citizen.' 'Accordingly,' says Lieber in his work on Civil Liberty and Self- Government, 62, in speaking of the English law in this respect, 'no man's house can be forcibly opened, or he or his goods be carried away after it has thus been forced, except in cases of felony; and then the sheriff must be furnished with a warrant, and take great care lest he commit a trespass. This principle is jealously insisted upon.' In Ex parte Jackson, \n96 \nU.S. 727, 733\n, 24 S. L. ed. 877, 879, this court recognized the principle of protection as applicable to letters and sealed packages in the mail, and held that, consistently \n\n[232 U.S. 383, 391]\n\u00a0\n with this guaranty of the right of the people to be secure in their papers against unreasonable searches and seizures, such matter could only be opened and examined upon warrants issued on oath or affirmation, particularly describing the thing to be seized, 'as is required when papers are subjected to search in one's own household.'\n In the Boyd Case, supra, after citing Lord Camden's judgment in Entick v. Carrington, 19 How. St. Tr. 1029, Mr. Justice Bradley said (630):\n'The principles laid down in this opinion affect the very essence of constitutional liberty and security. They reach farther than the concrete form of the case then before the court, with its adventitious circumstances; they apply to all invasions on the part of the government and its employees of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life. It is not the breaking of his doors and the rummaging of his drawers that constitutes the essence of the offense; but it is the invasion of his indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty, and private property, where that right has never been forfeited by his conviction of some public offense,-it is the invasion of this sacred right which underlies and constitutes the essence of Lord Camden's judgment.'\n\n In Bram v. United States, \n168 U.S. 532\n, 42 L. ed. 568, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 183, 10 Am. Crim. Rep. 547, this court, in speaking by the present Chief Justice of Boyd's Case, dealing with the 4th and 5th Amendments, said (544):\n'It was in that case demonstrated that both of these Amendments contemplated perpetuating, in their full efficacy, by means of a constitutional provision, principles of humanity and civil liberty which had been secured in the mother country only after years of struggle, so as to implant them in our institutions in the fullness of their integrity, free from the possibilities of future legislative change.'\n\n The effect of the 4th Amendment is to put the courts \n\n[232 U.S. 383, 392]\n\u00a0\n of the United States and Federal officials, in the exercise of their power and authority, under limitations and restraints as to the exercise of such power and authority, and to forever secure the people, their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against all unreasonable searches and seizures under the guise of law. This protection reaches all alike, whether accused of crime or not, and the duty of giving to it force and effect is obligatory upon all intrusted under our Federal system with the enforcement of the laws. The tendency of those who execute the criminal laws of the country to obtain conviction by means of unlawful seizures and enforced confessions, the latter often obtained after subjecting accused persons to unwarranted practices destructive of rights secured by the Federal Constitution, should find no sanction in the judgments of the courts, which are charged at all times with the support of the Constitution, and to which people of all conditions have a right to appeal for the maintenance of such fundamental rights.\n What, then, is the present case? Before answering that inquiry specifically, it may be well by a process of exclusion to state what it is not. It is not an assertion of the right on the part of the government always recognized under English and American law, to search the person of the accused when legally arrested, to discover and seize the fruits or evidences of crime. This right has been uniformly maintained in many cases. 1 Bishop. Crim. Proc.  211; Wharton, Crim. Pl. & Pr. 8th ed.  60; Dillon v. O'Brien, 16 Cox, C. C. 245, I. R. L. R. 20 C. L. 300, 7 Am. Crim. Rep. 66. Nor is it the case of testimony offered at a trial where the court is asked to stop and consider the illegal means by which proofs, otherwise competent, were obtained,-of which we shall have occasion to treat later in this opinion. Nor is it the case of burglar's tools or other proofs of guilt found upon his arrest within his control. \n\n[232 U.S. 383, 393]\n\u00a0\n The case in the aspect in which we are dealing with it involves the right of the court in a criminal prosecution to retain for the purposes of evidence the letters and correspondence of the accused, seized in his house in his absence and without his authority, by a United States marshal holding no warrant for his arrest and none for the search of his premises. The accused, without awaiting his trial, made timely application to the court for an order for the return of these letters, as well or other property. This application was denied, the letters retained and put in evidence, after a further application at the beginning of the trial, both applications asserting the rights of the accused under the 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution. If letters and private documents can thus be seized and held and used in evidence against a citizen accused of an offense, the protection of the 4th Amendment, declaring his right to be secure against such searches and seizures, is of no value, and, so far as those thus placed are concerned, might as well be stricken from the Constitution. The efforts of the courts and their officials to bring the guilty to punishment, praiseworthy as they are, are not to be aided by the sacrifice of those great principles established be years of endeavor and suffering which have resulted in their embodiment in the fundamental law of the land. The United States marshal could only have invaded the house of the accused when armed with a warrant issued as required by the Constitution, upon sworn information, and describing with reasonable particularity the thing for which the search was to be made. Instead, he acted without sanction of law, doubtless prompted by the desire to bring further proof to the aid of the government, and under color of his office undertook to make a seizure of private papers in direct violation of the constitutional prohibition against such action. Under such circumstances, without sworn information and particular description, not even an order of court would \n\n[232 U.S. 383, 394]\n\u00a0\n have justified such procedure; much less was it within the authority of the United States marshal to thus invade the house and privacy of the accused. In Adams v. New York, \n192 U.S. 585\n, 48 L. ed. 575, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 372, this court said that the 4th Amendment was intended to secure the citizen in person and property against unlawful invasion of the sanctity of his home by officers of the law, acting under legislative or judicial sanction. This protection is equally extended to the action of the government and officers of the law acting under it. Boyd Case, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 29 L. ed. 746, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 524. To sanction such proceedings would be to affirm by judicial decision a manifest neglect, if not an open defiance, of the prohibitions of the Constitution, intended for the protection of the people against such unauthorized action.\n The court before which the application was made in this case recognized the illegal character of the seizure, and ordered the return of property not in its judgment competent to be offered at the trial, but refused the application of the accused to turn over the letters, which were afterwards put in evidence on behalf of the government. While there is no opinion in the case, the court in this proceeding doubtless relied upon what is now contended by the government to be the correct rule of law under such circumstances, that the letters having come into the control of the court, it would not inquire into the manner in which they were obtained, but, if competent, would keep them and permit their use in evidence. Such proposition, the government asserts, is conclusively established by certain decisions of this court, the first of which is Adams v. New York, supra. In that case the plaintiff in error had been convicted in the supreme court of the state of New York for having in his possession certain gambling paraphernalia used in the game known as policy, in violation of the Penal Code of New York. At the trial certain papers, which had been seized by police officers executing a search warrant for the discovery and \n\n[232 U.S. 383, 395]\n\u00a0\n seizure of policy slips, and which had been found in addition to the policy slips, were offered in evidence over his objection. The conviction was affirmed by the court of appeals of New York (176 N. Y. 351, 63 L.R.A. 406, 98 Am. St. Rep. 675, 68 N. E. 636), and the case was brought here for alleged violation of the 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. Pretermitting the question whether these Amendments applied to the action of the states, this court proceeded to examine the alleged violations of the 4th and 5th Amendments, and put its decision upon the ground that the papers found in the execution of the search warrant, which warrant had a legal purpose in the attempt to find gambling paraphernalia, was competent evidence against the accused, and their offer in testimony did not violate his constitutional privilege against unlawful search or seizure, for is was held that such incriminatory documents thus discovered were not the subject of an unreasonable search and seizure, and in effect that the same were incidentally seized in the lawful execution of a warrant, and not in the wrongful invasion of the home of a citizen, and the unwarranted seizure of his papers and property. It was further held, approving in that respect the doctrine laid down in 1 Greenleaf, Ev.  254a, that it was no valid objection to the use of the papers that they had been thus seized, and that the courts in the course of a trial would not make an issue to determine that question, and many state cases were cited supporting that doctrine.\n The same point had been ruled in People v. Adams, 176 N. Y. 351, 63 L. R.A. 406, 98 Am. St. Rep. 675, 68 N. E. 636, from which decision the case was brought to this court, where it was held that if the papers seized in addition to the policy slips were competent evidence in the case, as the court held they were, they were admissible in evidence at the trial, the court saying (p. 358): 'The underlying principle obviously is that the court, when engaged in trying a criminal cause, will not take notice of \n\n[232 U.S. 383, 396]\n\u00a0\n the manner in which witnesses have possessed themselves of papers, or other articles of personal property, which are material and properly offered in evidence.' This doctrine thus laid down by the New York court of appeals and approved by this court, that a court will not, in trying a criminal cause, permit a collateral issue to be raised as to the source of competent testimony, has the sanction of so many state cases that it would be impracticable to cite or refer to them in detail. Many of them are collected in the note to State v. Turner, 136 Am. St. Rep. 129, 135 et seq. After citing numerous cases the editor says: 'The underlying principle of all these decisions obviously is, that the court, when engaged in the trial of a criminal action, will not take notice of the manner in which a witness has possessed himself of papers or other chattels, subjects of evidence, which are material and properly offered in evidence. People v. Adams, supra. Such an investigation is not involved necessarily in the litigation in chief, and to pursue it would be to halt in the orderly progress of a cause, and consider incidentally a question which has happened to cross the path of such litigation, and which is wholly independent thereof.'\n It is therefore evident that the Adams Case affords no authority for the action of the court in this case, when applied to in due season for the return of papers seized in violation of the Constitutional Amendment. The decision in that case rests upon incidental seizure made in the execution of a legal warrant, and in the application of the doctrine that a collateral issue will not be raised to ascertain the source from which testimony, competent in a criminal case, comes.\n The government also relies upon Hale v. Henkel, \n201 U.S. 43\n, 50 L. ed. 652, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 370, in which the previous cases of Boyd v. United States, and Adams v.

Rep. 1125, and Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baird, \n194 U.S. 25\n, 48 L. ed. 860, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 563, are reviewed, and wherein it was held that a subpoena duces tecum requiring a corporation to produce all its contracts and correspondence with no less than six other companies, as well as all letters received by the corporation from thirteen other companies, located in different parts of the United States, was an unreasonable search and seizure within the 4th Amendment, and it was there stated that (p. 76) 'an order for the production of books and papers may constitute an unreasonable search and seizuer within the 4th Amendment. While a search ordinarily implies a quest by an officer of the law, and a seizure contemplates a forcible dispossession of the owner, still, as was held in the Boyd Case, the substance of the offense is the compulsory production of private papers, whether under a search warrant or a subpoena duces tecum, against which the person, be he individual or corporation, is entitled to protection.' If such a seizure under the authority of a warrant supposed to be legal, constitutes a violation of the constitutional protection, a fortiori does the attempt of an officer of the United States, the United States marshal, acting under color of his office, without even the sanction of a warrant, constitute an invasion of the rights within the protection afforded by the 4th Amendment.\n Another case relied upon is American Tobacco Co. v. Werckmeister, \n207 U.S. 284\n, 52 L. ed. 208, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 72, 12 Ann. Cas. 595, in which it was held that the seizure by the United States marshal in a copyright case of certain pictures under a writ of replevin did not constitute an unreasonable search and seizure. The other case from this court relied upon is Holt v. United States, \n218 U.S. 245\n, 54 L. ed. 1021, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 20, 20 Ann. Cas. 1138, in which it was held that testimony tending to show that a certain blouse which was in evidence as incriminating him, had been put upon the prisoner, and fitted him, did not violate his constitutional right. We \n\n[232 U.S. 383, 398]\n\u00a0\n are at a loss to see the application of these cases to the one in hand.\n The right of the court to deal with papers and documents in the possession of the district attorney and other officers of the court, and subject to its authority, was recognized in Wise v. Henkel, \n220 U.S. 556\n, 55 L. ed. 581, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 599. That papers wrongfully seized should be turned over to the accused has been frequently recognized ognized in the early as well as later decisions of the courts. 1 Bishop, Crim. Proc.  210; Rex v. Barnett, 3 Car. & P. 600; Rex v. Kinsey, 7 Car. & P. 447; United States v. Mills, 185 Fed. 318; United States v. McHie, 194 Fed. 894, 898.\n We therefore reach the conclusion that the letters in question were taken from the house of the accused by an official of the United States, acting under color of his office, in direct violation of the constitutional rights of the defendant; that having made a seasonable application for their return, which was heard and passed upon by the court, there was involved in the order refusing the application a denial of the constitutional rights of the accused, and that the court should have restored these letters to the accused. In holding them and permitting their use upon the trial, we think prejudicial error was committed. As to the papers and property seized by the policement, it does not appear that they acted under any claim of Federal authority such as would make the amendment applicable to such unauthorized seizures. The record shows that what they did by way of arrest and search and seizure was done before the finding of the indictment in the Federal court; under what supposed right or authority does not appear. What remedies the defendant may have against them we need not inquire, as the 4th Amendment is not directed to individual misconduct of such officials. Its limitations reach the Federal government and its agencies. Boyd Case, \n116 U.S. 616\n, 29 L. ed. 746, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 524, and see Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 U.S. 78\n, 53 L. ed. 97, 29 Sup.

DE PALMA(1914)\nNo. 173\nArgued: January 20, 1914Decided: February 24, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 571, 572]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Neill B. Field for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Francis E. Wood, Owen N. Marron, and A. B. McMillen for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n In November, 1901, Weinman, one of the plaintiffs in error, being the owner of a building and lot of land in Albuquerque, New Mexico, leased them to defendants in error for a term of two years, to commence in December, following. They entered into possession, and occupied and used the building in their business of prescription and retail druggists. Plaintiff in error Barnett was the owner of an adjoining lot and building. Some time in May or June, 1902, while the Weinman building was occupied by defendants in error, Barnett took down and removed his building, including the wall adjacent to the Weinman building. The east wall of the latter was an old adobe wall that stood close to, but perhaps a few inches away from, the easterly boundary line of the lot. In May, 1902, Weinman and Barnett entered into an agreement in writing, whereby Barnett was to construct a party wall, \n\n[232 U.S. 571, 573]\n\u00a0\n to stand one half of its full thickness upon each lot; the footing course to be 40 inches wide; the foundation wall to be 18 inches thick from the top of the footing to its full height, where it was to receive the first floor joints; the wall above that to be of less thickness. It was stipulated that Barnett should be permitted to take down any part of the east wall of the Weinman building as might be necessary in order to locate the new wall centrally over the property line, and if, through his fault, damage should be done to the Weinman building, he was to make it good. In the execution of this agreement, it was necessary to undermine the east wall of the Weinman building. Barnett made an agreement with one Grande, a general contractor, by which the latter was to do the excavation and stone work according to plans and specifications, and as directed by La Driere, a superintendent who was in Barnett's employ. Grande proceeded under La Driere's direction to do the work. It would seem that the purpose was to excavate for the party wall in sections, so that support for the Weinman building should not at any time be entirely lacking. On or about June 30th, the contractor having excavated for a space about 5 feet in length along the line between the two lots at the northeast corner of the Weinman building, and extending under the east wall of that building for approximately 12 inches, the wall fell, damaging the stock-in-trade and fixtures of defendants in error, and rendering the building untenantable. They removed what remained of their stock and fixtures to another and less desirable location, and carried on their business there, up to the time their lease of the Weinman lot and building would have expired by its terms. After the wall fell, Weinman made demand for the rent payable by the lease for the month of July, 1902, and, defendants in error having refused to pay it, Weinman took possession.\n Defendants in error brought suit against both Weinman \n\n[232 U.S. 571, 574]\n\u00a0\n and Barnett in the district court of one of the counties of the then territory of New Mexico. The action was in the nature of an action of trespass, and damages were claimed for the destruction of parts and injury to other parts of the stock-in-trade and fixtures, for the being compelled to remove to a less favorable location at considerable expense, and for the loss of profits in the business. (There was also a claim of damages for eviction and the loss of the leasehold, but this was afterwards abandoned.)\n Answers were filed, and there were subsequent amendments to the pleadings, but it is not necessary to recite them.\n The action has been at least three times tried by jury, and three times reviewed by the supreme court of New Mexico. Upon the first trial a verdict was directed in favor of defendants, and the supreme court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for a new trial. 13 N. M. 226, 82 Pac. 360. The second trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for plaintiffs, which was reversed because compensation for loss of profits and for goods injured was included without sufficient evidence to sustain this part of the recovery. 15 N. M. 68, 24 L.R.A.(N.S.) 423, 103 Pac. 782. At the last trial, the proof was to some extent supplemented, and there was a judgment in favor of plaintiffs for $7,738, based upon the verdict of a jury for that amount. On appeal, the supreme court found error only with respect to the proof as to damaged goods, and required plaintiffs to elect whether they would file a remittitur of $770 on this account, or submit to a new trial. 16 N. M. 302, 121 Pac. 38. They chose the former alternative, and the judgment was affirmed for the reduced amount. The present writ of error was then sued out.\n The record is voluminous. In the territorial supreme court, 105 assignments of error were filed in behalf of Barnett and 68 in behalf of Weinman. In this court the assignments of error are 110 in number. We shall make no \n\n[232 U.S. 571, 575]\n\u00a0\n effort to deal with them in detail. The points that seem to require mention are the following:\n We agree with the supreme court of New Mexico that where the owner of demised premises makes a contract with an adjoining owner for the construction of a party wall, which contract cannot be carried out according to its terms without entry upon the demised premises and an undermining of the tenant's wall, and the adjoining owner or his servants, in the performance of the contract, do commit such a trespass upon the tenant's possession and undermine the wall, the contract is evidential of a command or approval of the trespass by the landlord, such as to render him liable severally, or jointly with the adjoining owner, in an action by the tenant for the resulting damages.

Pulitizer, 142 N. Y. 263, 268, 36 N. E. 1059\n\n\n In our opinion, the court correctly held that where a trespass results in the destruction of a building, with consequent interruption of a going business, the loss of future profits (these being reasonably certain and proved with reasonable exactitude) forms a proper element for consideration in awarding compensatory damages.

L. 501, 514, 68 Atl. 150.\n We agree also with the court below that upon the last trial there was legitimate evidence upon which to base an allowance of damages for loss of profits, and no substantial error in the rulings on evidence or in the instructions to the jury upon the subject.\n It is contended that plaintiffs in error are not responsible \n\n[232 U.S. 571, 576]\n\u00a0\n for what was done by Grande in building the party wall because he was an independent contractor.\n But the evidence showed that he was required to follow the instructions of La Driere, who was Barnett's agent, and that La Driere was in fact in charge of the work. For this reason it was properly held that Grande was not an independent contractor. New Orleans, M. & C. R. Co. v. Hanning, 15 Wall. 649, 657, 21 L. ed. 220, 223, 7 Am. Neg. Cas. 309; Singer Mfg.

Batson, Graddy Cary, John M. Scott, and Thomas J. Graydon for plaintiff in error. \n\n[235 U.S. 261, 264]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. M. Chilton, James P. Edwards, Charles F. Ogden, and R. F. Peak for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n\n[235 U.S. 261, 267]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Pitney delivered the opinion of the court:\n In September, 1907, plaintiff in error, an Illinois corporation, organized under the general laws of that state applicable to life insurance, issued to one George McCormick, a resident of Louisville, Kentucky, two policies, each insuring his life in the sum of $1,000, for the benefit of his nephew, Clarence Rupp, if living, otherwise for the benefit of the executors of the insured. After the death of the insured, which occurred in the same year, the present action was brought by Rupp against the company in the Jefferson circuit court at Louisville. His petition set forth his relationship to the insured, and beyond this showed no insurable interest. It averred that the policies were issued upon McCormick's application, who also paid the premiums thereon, and this without plaintiff's instance, request, or knowledge. The summons was served upon the insurance commissioner of the state. Section 631, Kentucky Statutes [Ky. Stat. 1909,  4279], provides: 'Before authority is granted to any foreign insurance company to do business in this state, it must file with the commissioner a resolution adopted by its board of directors, consenting that service of process upon any agent of such company in this state, or upon the commissioner of insurance of this state, in any action brought or pending in this state, shall be a valid service upon said company; and if process is served upon the commissioner it shall be his duty to at once send it by mail, addressed to the company at its principal office.'\n The defendant company made a special appearance to the action, and moved the court, to quash the return upon the summons on the ground that it was a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Illinois; that at the time the policies in question were issued it had applied to the superintendent of insurance of the state of Kentucky for a license to transact business in that state, \n\n[235 U.S. 261, 268]\n\u00a0\n and, in case such license was issued, to appoint said superintendent of insurance its agent for service of process; that the application for license was pending for some time, and that it was during this time that the policies sued on were issued, but that the application for license was afterwards rejected by the insurance department of the state; that the company never appointed the superintendent of insurance its agent for service of process, and never consented that he might be served with or accept such service on the company's behalf.\n The motion was overruled, and the company thereafter filed an answer in which, without waiving its objection to the jurisdiction of the court over it, but reiterating that objection, it set up sundry defenses upon the merits, including an allegation of fraudulent representations in the application pursuant to which the policies were issued, and a denial that the plaintiff had an insurable interest in McCormick's life. To certain paragraphs of this answer plaintiff demurred, and the circuit court, upon the ground that this demurrer rendered it proper and necessary to determine the sufficiency of plaintiff's petition, reviewed that pleading, and reached the conclusion that, by the law of Kentucky, the relationship of uncle and nephew did not constitute an insurable interest, that one who could not take out a policy because of lack of interest could not hold it if assigned to him after its issuance, and that the same rule prevented a person from taking out a policy of insurance upon his own life in favor of another having no insurable interest. Therefore the court sustained the demurrer as against the petition, and, plaintiff having declined to plead further, judgment was rendered in favor of defendant.\n Plaintiff appealed to the court of appeals, which held (138 Ky. 18, 29 L.R.A.(N.S.) 675, 127 S. W. 490) that while, according to the law of Kentucky, one who obtains a policy of insurance upon the life of another must have an insurable interest in that life, \n\n[235 U.S. 261, 269]\n\u00a0\n it is otherwise with respect to a policy taken out by a person upon his own life, he paying the premium for the benefit of another having no insurable interest, and that such a policy is not a wagering transaction, but is valid. The judgment of the circuit court was therefore reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings. Thereafter defendant filed a 'second amended answer' in the circuit court, withdrawing by the court's leave 'each and every allegation of the original answer and the first amended answer herein,' and-'without waiving its plea to the jurisdiction of this court of the person of this defendant in this action'-set up that defendant was a corporation organized and incorporated under an act of the legislature of the state of Illinois approved June 22, 1893, entitled, 'An Act to Incorporate Companies to Do the Business of Life or Accident Insurance on the Assessment Plan, and to Control Such Companies of This State and of Other States Doing Business in This State,' etc., which contains in  9 the following: 'No corporation doing business of life insurance under this act shall issue a certificate or policy upon . . . a life in which the beneficiary named has no insurable interest. Any assignment of the policy or certificate to a person having no insurable interest in the insured life shall render such a policy or certificate void.' It was further averred that under this act defendant had no power to issue any policy of insurance upon the life of any person in which the beneficiary named had no insurable interest; that the plaintiff Rupp was the nephew of the insured McCormick; that Rupp had no insurable interest by virtue of such relationship or otherwise in the life of the insured, and that the policies sued on were null and void. There was a tender of the amount of the premiums paid and a denial of further liability. The answer invoked the 'full faith and credit' clause of the Federal Constitution, averring that to compel defendant to pay the policies \n\n[235 U.S. 261, 270]\n\u00a0\n sued on would be a failure upon the part of the state of Kentucky to give full faith and credit to the act of the legislature of the state of Illinois.\n To this answer plaintiff demurred, and the circuit court sustained the demurrer, with leave to amend the answer. Defendant declined to further amend, and elected to rely only upon the answer to which the demurrer had been sustained. Judgment having been thereupon rendered in favor of plaintiff for the amount of the two policies with interest, defendant prosecuted its appeal to the court of appeals, and to review the decision of that court affirming the judgment (147 Ky. 489, 144 S. W. 743), the present writ of error is sued out.\n There are two Federal questions. The first is raised by the contention that under the Kentucky statute already quoted a foreign insurance company sued in a state court cannot lawfully be summoned by a substituted service upon the state insurance commissioner unless the company has been licensed to do business in the state, and has, by resolution of its board of directors, assented to such substituted service; and that to sustain a judgment rendered in the absence of such service is violative of the 'due process' clause of the 14th Amendment. To this contention the court of appeals responded thus: 'It is too late now to raise the question that the process was not properly served. This question should have been presented on the first appeal. On that appeal the case was heard here on the merits, and it is too late after a reversal on the merits to raise any question as to the sufficiency of the process.' [147 Ky. 490.] Citing McDowell v. Chesapeake, O. & S. W. R. Co. 90 Ky. 346, 14 S. W. 338, and Illinois C. R. Co. v. Glover, 24 Ky. L. Rep. 1447, 71 S. W. 630. That it is and long has been the practice of the courts of Kentucky to treat the appearance of a party in the appellate court as a submission to the jurisdiction so as to dispense with the \n\n[235 U.S. 261, 271]\n\u00a0\n service of process in the court below, and that this rule is applied even where a judgment against the defendant is reversed because of a defect in process, will appear from an examination of the cases. Grace v. Taylor, 1 Bibb, 430; Graves v. Hughes, 4 Bibb, 84; Wharton v. Clay, 4 Bibb, 167; Bradford v. Gillespie, 8 Dana, 67, 68; Salter v. Dunn, 1 Bush, 311, 317; Chesapeake, O. & S. W. R. Co. v. Heath, 87 Ky. 651, 660, 9 S. W. 832.\n It is contended that where, as here, the first appeal is prosecuted by plaintiff, the defendant's objection to the jurisdiction of the trial court over its person is not thereby waived, because no other question could properly be submitted to the appellate court except that raised by the plaintiff's appeal. But, by  755 of the Kentucky Civil Code, 'The appellee may obtain a cross appeal at any time before trial, by an entry on the records of the court of appeals.' And under this section it is held that 'when either party appeals from a final judgment, his adversary may have a cross appeal from that judgment, for the purpose of correcting any errors in the judgment to his prejudice, or any interlocutory judgment or order which has influenced or controlled the final judgment to his prejudice.' Brown v. Vancleave, 86 Ky. 381, 386, 6 S. W. 25.\n The provisions of the Code and the course of previous decisions fairly sustain the decision of the court of appeals in the present case to the effect that the now plaintiff in error, by permitting the first judgment to be reviewed at the instance of the plaintiff in the action without interposing a cross appeal to call into question the decision of the trial court upon the motion to quash the return upon the process, waived its objection to the jurisdiction of the court over it, and could not have any benefit of that objection upon the second appeal.\n That a state, without violence to the 'due process' clause of the 14th Amendment, may declare that one who voluntarily enters one of its courts to contest any \n\n[235 U.S. 261, 272]\n\u00a0\n question in an action there pending shall be deemed to have submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court for all purposes of the action, and may attach consequences of this character even to a special appearance entered for the purpose of objecting that the trial court has not acquired jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, is settled by the decision of this court in York v. Texas, \n137 U.S. 15\n, 34 L. ed. 604, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 9; followed in Kauffman v. Wootters, \n138 U.S. 285\n, 34 L. ed. 962, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 298.\n It is true that in Harkness v. Hyde, \n98 U.S. 476\n, 25 L. ed. 237, on review of the judgment of a territorial court, it was held that the right of the defendant to insist upon an objection to the illegality of the service of process was not waived by the special appearance of his counsel to move the dismissal of the action or the setting aside of the service upon that ground, nor, when that motion was overruled, by his answering to the merits; and that the objection was available here as a ground for reversal. To the same effect are the decisions on review of judgments and decrees of the Federal courts. Southern P. Co. v. Denton, \n146 \nU.S. 202, 206\n, 36 S. L. ed. 942, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44; Mexican C. R. Co. v. Pinkney, \n149 \nU.S. 194, 209\n, 37 S. L. ed. 699, 705, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 859; Goldey v. Morning News, \n156 U.S. 518\n, 39 L. ed. 517, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 559; Davis v. Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. R. Co. \n217 \nU.S. 157, 174\n, 54 S. L. ed. 708, 718, 27 L.R.A.(N.S.) 823, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 463, 18 Ann. Cas. 907. And a standing rule of a Federal court, requiring a party appearing specially for any purpose to declare at the same time that if the purpose for which the special appearance was made should not be sanctioned or sustained by the court, he would appear generally, was held inconsistent with the laws of the United States and therefore invalid. Davidson Bros. Marble Co. v. United States, \n213 \nU.S. 10, 18\n, 53 S. L. ed. 675, 679, 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. 324. But the recognition and enforcement of this right on the part of defendants in the Federal courts is a matter quite apart from the authority of the states to establish a different rule of practice within their jurisdictions, as was expressly recognized in York v. Texas, \n137 \nU.S. 17, 20\n, 34 S. L. ed. 604, 605, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 9; Southern P. Co. v. Denton, 146 U. S. \n\n[235 U.S. 261, 273]\n\u00a0\n 202, 208, 36 L. ed. 942, 945, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44; Mexican C. R. Co. v. Pinkney, \n149 \nU.S. 194, 207\n, 37 S. L. ed. 699, 704, 13 Sup. Ct. Rep. 859; McLaughlin Bros. v. Hallowell, \n228 \nU.S. 278, 289\n, 57 S. L. ed. 835, 840, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 465.\n The 14th Amendment declares that no state shall 'deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' This prohibition has regard not to matters of form, but to substance of right. Since its adoption, whatever was the rule before, a nonresident party against whom a personal action is instituted in a state court without service of process upon him may, if he please, ignore the proceeding as wholly ineffective, and set up its invalidity if and when an attempt is made to take his property thereunder, or when he is sued upon it in the same or another jurisdiction. Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714, 732\n, 733 S., 24 L. ed. 565, 572; York v. Texas, \n137 \nU.S. 15, 21\n, 34 S. L. ed. 604, 605, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 9. But if he desires to raise the question of the validity of the proceeding in the court in which it is instituted, so as to avoid even the semblance of a judgment against him, it is within the power of the state to declare that he shall do this subject to the risk of being obliged to submit to the jurisdiction of the court to hear and determine the merits, if the objection raised to its jurisdiction over his person shall be overruled. This prevents a defendant from doing what plaintiff in error has attempted to do in the present case; that is, to secure, if possible, the benefit of a binding adjudication in its favor upon the merits, through the exercise of the court's jurisdiction, while depriving its adversary of any possibility of success by reserving an objection to the jurisdiction of the court to render any judgment against it. As appears from Southern P. Co. v. Denton, and other cases of the same class above cited, the distribution of original and appellate jurisdiction in the Federal courts is such as to sometimes give an advantage of this kind to defendants; but it is not indispensable to 'due process of law.'\n The second Federal question is raised by the insistence of plaintiff in error that the Kentucky court of appeals \n\n[235 U.S. 261, 274]\n\u00a0\n failed to give such credit to the Illinois statute as it was required to give under article 4,  1, of the Constitution of the United States, and the act of Congress passed to carry it into effect ( 905, Rev. Stat. U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 677).\n Upon an examination of the record, we are unable to perceive that the Kentucky court failed to accord to the Illinois statute the credit to which it was entitled under the Federal system. The court recognized the existence of the statute and its validity, as pleaded by defendant and as admitted by plaintiff's demurrer. It also recognized the relevancy of the statute to the question in controversy, and either admitted or assumed that it had the effect of limiting the powers of defendant with respect to issuing policies of insurance, so far as the terms of the statute extended. Thereupon it became necessary for the court, in the due performance of its judicial function, to interpret the meaning of the enactment, in order to determine whether it evidenced the purpose of the lawmaking body to limit the powers of the corporations with respect to business conducted beyond the confines of the state of its origin. So doing, the court held as follows (147 Ky. 490, 491, 144 S. W. 744):\n'Upon an inspection of the whole act we are satisfied that the section above quoted was not intended by the legislature of Illinois to have an extraterritorial effect. It was only intended to regulate the business done in Illinois. The act is a general one governing this character of business and evidently refers to business done in Illinois . . . . When in a charter of an incorporated company restrictions are imposed as to the kind of business it may do, such limitations upon the power of the company ordinarily follow it wherever it goes; that is, when such a company comes into another state, it has only the powers which its charter confers. But that is not this case. The act in question is a general law regulating insurance companies and was evidently designed as a \n\n[235 U.S. 261, 275]\n\u00a0\n regulation of the business in the state of Illinois. It has no application to the business done in Kentucky.'\n\n It does not appear that the court's attention was called to any decision by the courts of Illinois placing a different construction, or, indeed, any construction, upon the section in question. If such decision existed, it was incumbent upon defendant to plead and prove it as matter of fact. We are referred to no authoritative judicial construction of the statute in the state of its origin, nor have we searched for any, for what is matter of fact in the state court is matter of fact in this court upon review; and this applies where foreign law is in question in the state court as well as to any other issue of fact. Hanley v. Donoghue, \n116 \nU.S. 1, 6\n, 29 S. L. ed. 535, 537, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 242; Chicago & A. R. Co. v. Wiggins Ferry Co. \n119 \nU.S. 615, 622\n, 30 S. L. ed. 519, 522, 7 Sup. Ct. Rep. 398.\n It is earnestly argued that the court erred in its construction of the Illinois statute. We do not pass upon this question, deeming it to be outside of the limits of our jurisdiction; for it is settled that where, in a state court, the validity of an act of the legislature of another state is not in question, and the controversy turns merely upon its interpretation or construction, no question arises under the 'full faith and credit' clause of the Federal Constitution.

The message was delivered to the company in South Carolina, addressed to the plaintiff in Washington, District of Columbia, and read, 'Come at once. Your sister died this morning.' It was forwarded without delay to Washington, but there, through negligence, as the jury found, was not delivered. The declaration alleges that the failure caused the plaintiff to miss attending her sister's funeral in South Carolina, and subjected the plaintiff to mental anguish, which of itself is made a cause of action by a statute of South Carolina. Civil Code,  2223. The defendants in error state that the action was brought under this section. There was a trial at which, by the instructions to the jury, a recovery was allowed under the act for the negligence in Washington, irrespective of the law prevailing here. The jury found a verdict for $750, which was sustained by the supreme court of the state. 92 S. C. 354, 75 S. E. 542. The plaintiff in error saved its rights under the Constitution of the United States (so plainly that it is not necessary to discuss the matter), and brought the case here.\n Whatever variations of opinion and practice there may \n\n[234 U.S. 542, 547]\n\u00a0\n have been, it is established as the law of this court that when a person recovers in one jurisdiction for a tort committed in another, he does so on the ground of an obligation incurred at the place of the tort that accompanies the person of the defendant elsewhere, and that is not only the ground but the measure of the maximum recovery.

The injustice of imposing a greater liability than that created by the law governing the conduct of the parties at the time of the act or omission complained of is obvious; and when a state attempts in this manner to affect conduct outside its jurisdiction, or the consequences of such conduct, and to infringe upon the power of the United States, it must fail. The principle would be illustrated by supposing a direct clash between the state and Federal statutes; but it is the same whenever the state undertakes to go beyond its jurisdiction into territory where the United States has exclusive control.

Sohmer \n233 U.S. 434\n (1914) ]\n\n\n[233 U.S. 434, 437]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William Law Stout for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the judgment of the court:\n This proceeding began with a petition by an executor, acting under ancillary letters, for the appointment of an appraiser to determine the amount, if any, of the transfer tax due from the estate of the deceased testator, Charles C. Tiffany. Tiffany was not a resident of New York at the time of his death, but left in a safe deposit box in New York four promissory notes made by Pottinger, a resident of Chicago, secured by mortgages of Chicago land to Illinois trustees, and promissory notes of the Southern Railway Company, a Virginia corporation. The appraiser held these notes taxable under the New York laws of 1905, chap. 368,  1, amending  220 of an earlier law, and imposing a tax 'when the transfer is by will or intestate law, of property within the state, and the decedent was a nonresident of the state at the time of his death.' The surro- \n\n[233 U.S. 434, 438]\n\u00a0\n gate confirmed the appraiser's report, and his order was affirmed by the appellate division and the court of appeals. 143 App. Div. 327, 128 N. Y. Supp. 106; 202 N. Y. 550, 95 N. E. 1140. The executors contend that the tax deprives them of their property without due process of law.\n In support of this position it was argued that if bonds were subject to taxation simply because of their presence within the jurisdiction, it was due to the survival of primitive notions that identified the obligation with the parchment or paper upon which they were written; that bills and notes had a different history, and that there was no ground for extending the conceptions of the infancy of the race to them. It was pointed out that the power to tax simple contracts depends upon power over the person of one of the parties, and does not attach to documentary evidence of such contracts that may happen to be within the jurisdiction. Cases were cited in which this court has pronounced bills and notes to be only evidences of the simple contracts that they express (Pelham v. Way, 15 Wall. 196, 21 L. ed. 55; Wyman v. Halstead [Wyman v. United States] \n109 \nU.S. 654, 656\n, 27 S. L. ed. 1068, 1069, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 417); and the precise issue was thought to be disposed of by Buck v. Beach, \n206 U.S. 392\n, 51 L. ed. 1106, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 712, 11 Ann. Cas. 732. We shall discuss this case, but for the moment it is enough to say that for the purposes of argument we assume that bills and notes stand as mere evidences at common law.\n But we are bound by the construction given to the New York statutes by the New York courts, and the question is whether a statute that we must read as purporting to give to bills and notes within the state the same standing as bonds for purposes of taxation goes beyond the constitutional power of the state. Again, for the purposes of argument we may assume that there are limits to this kind of power; that the presence of a deed would not warrant a tax measured by the value of the real estate that it had conveyed, or even that a memorandum of a contract required by the statute of frauds would not sup- \n\n[233 U.S. 434, 439]\n\u00a0\n port a tax on the value of the contract because it happened to be found in the testator's New York strong box. But it is plain that bills and notes, whatever they may be called, come very near to identification with the contract that they embody. An indorsement of the paper carries the contract to the indorser. An indorsement in blank passes the debt from hand to hand so that whoever has the paper has the debt. It is true that in some cases there may be a recovery without producing and surrendering the paper, but so may there be upon a bond in modern times. It is not primitive tradition alone that gives their peculiarities to bonds, but a tradition laid hold of, modified and adapted to the convenience and understanding of business men. The same convenience and understanding apply to bills and notes, as no one would doubt in the case of bank notes, which technically do not differ from others. It would be an extraordinary deduction from the 14th Amendment to deny the power of a state to adopt the usages and views of business men in a statute on the ground that it was depriving them of their property without due process of law. The necessity of caution in cutting down the power of taxation on the strength of the 14th Amendment often has been adverted to. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co. \n197 \nU.S. 430, 434\n, 49 S. L. ed. 819, 821, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 466. Unless we are bound by authority, we think the statute, so far as we now are concerned with it, plainly within the power of the state to pass.\n As to authority, it has been asserted or implied, again and again, that the states had the power to deal with negotiable paper on the footing of situs. 'It is well settled that bank bills and municipal bonds are in such a concrete, tangible form that they are subject to taxation where found, irrespective of the domicil of the owner; . . . Notes and mortgages are of the same nature . . . we see no reason why a state may not declare that, if found within its limits, they shall be subject to taxation.'

Beach, supra.\n No such effect should be attributed to that case. The Ohio notes in Buck's hands that were held not to be taxable in Indiana were moved backward and forward between Ohio and Indiana with the intent to avoid taxation in either state. \n206 U.S. 402\n. They really were in Ohio hands for business purposes (id. 395), and sending them to Indiana was spoken of by Mr. Justice Peckham as improper and unjustifiable, Id. 402. Their absence from Ohio evidently was regarded as a temporary absence from home. Id. 404. And the conclusion is carefully limited to a refusal to hold the presence of the notes 'under the circumstances already stated' to amount to the presence of property within the state. A distinction was taken between the presence sufficient for a succession tax like that in this case, and that required for a property tax such as then was before the court, and the only point decided was that the notes had no such presence in Indiana as to warrant a property tax. See New York ex rel. New York C. & H. R. R. Co. v. Miller, \n202 \nU.S. 584, 597\n, 50 S. L. ed. 1155, 1160, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 714. If Buck v. Beach is not to be distinguished on one of the foregoing grounds, as some of us think that it can be, we are of opinion that it must yield to the current of authorities to which we have referred.\n In the case at bar it must be taken that the safe deposit box in which the notes were found was their permanent resting place, and therefore that the power of the state so repeatedly asserted in our decisions could come into play.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n[233 U.S. 434, 441]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKenna, concurring:\n I concur in the result, but cannot concur in the reasoning of the opinion, or rather, its controlling proposition, unmodified. I might pass it by in silence if it did not have larger consequence than the decision of the pending case. The opinion is rested on the proposition, said to be based on authority, that the states have power to deal 'with negotiable paper on the footing of situs;' that is, to regard such paper so far concrete and tangible as to be of itself a subject of taxation, irrespective of the domicil of its owner, or, I add, the locality of the debt which it represents. For the proposition announced, Mr. Justice Brewer, in New Orleans v. Stempel, \n175 U.S. 309\n, 44 L. ed. 174, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 110, is quoted from. Other cases are cited and it is said to be established law unless it has been overthrown by the decision in Buck v. Beach, \n206 U.S. 392\n, 51 L. ed. 1106, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 712, 11 Ann. Cas. 732. I refrain from meeting the judgment of my brethren by simply opposing assertion, and I feel constrained to review the cases, including Buck v. Beach. I will do so in the order of their decision.\n Commencing with the Stempel Case I may immediately say of it that its facts did not call for the broad and general declaration it is adduced to sustain. The statute passed on did not attempt to tax negotiable paper simply because of its presence in the state. It regarded the origin and use of such paper, and declared its (the statute's) purpose to be that no nonresident, by himself or through an agent, should transact business in the state 'without paying to the state a corresponding tax with that exacted of its own citizens;' and, to execute the purpose, declared: 'All bills receivable, obligations or credits arising from the business done in the state, are hereby declared assessable within this state, and at the business domicil of said nonresident, his agent or representative.'\n The property assessed was inherited by Stempel's wards, they and she being residents of the state of New York. It \n\n[233 U.S. 434, 442]\n\u00a0\n was assessed to the estate of the grandfather of the wards, and was $15, 000, 'money in possession, on depoit, or in hand,' and $8,000, 'money loaned or advanced, or for goods sold; and all credits of every description.' The contention was that 'the situs of the loans and credits was in New York, the place of residence of the guardian and wards, and, therefore, geing loans and credits without the state of Louisiana, they were not subject to taxation therein.'\n The question presented by the contention, this court said, was whether, under the statute as interpreted by the supreme court of the state, the properties were subject to taxation, and, if so subject, whether any rights secured by the Federal Constitution were thereby infringed. The tax was sustained, but it will be observed that negotiable paper was not assessed at all or dealt with as an entity separate from what it represented. The notes which represented the credits taxed were, it is true, in New Orleans, but in possession of the agent of Stempel. Not they, but the rights of which they were the evidence, were taxed. The broad declaration, therefore, that negotiable paper had such tangibility as to be of itself a taxable entity was not called for. The true value of the case and its application to the case at bar can be estimated when we consider the other cases.\n In Bristol v. Washington County, \n177 U.S. 133\n, 44 L. ed. 701, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 585, notes secured by mortgages in the state (Minnesota) were taxed. The question was of their situs. The state court put its decision on the ground that the notes were in the state for collection or renewal with a view of reloaning the money and keeping it invested as a permanent business. And this court in its decision said that 'credits secured by mortgages, the result of the business of investing and reinvesting moneys in the state, were subject to tax as having a situs there.' The ruling was affirmed. We said, by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller: 'Persons are not per- \n\n[233 U.S. 434, 443]\n\u00a0\n mitted to avail themselves for their own benefit of the laws of a state in the conduct of business within its limits, and then to escape their due contribution to the public needs through action of this sort, whether taken for convenience or by design.'\n In State Assessors v. Comptoir National d'Escompte, \n191 U.S. 388\n, 48 L. ed. 232, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 109, credits in the form of checks were taxed under the same statute considered in the Stempel Case. They were held in the state for investment and reinvestment, and this was the basis of the decision. The checks, it was said, became a credit for money loaned, localized in Louisiana, protected by it, and within the scope of its taxing laws as construed by the supreme court. And we further said, after reviewing the Stempel Case and the Bristol Case: 'From these cases it may be taken as the settled law of this court that there is no inhibition in the Federal Constitution against the right of the state to tax property in the shape of credits where the same are evidenced by notes or obligations held within the state, in the hands of an agent of the owner for the purpose of collection or renewal with a view to new loans and carrying on such transactions as a permanent business.' (p. 403.)\n In Metropolitan L. Ins. Co. v. New Orleans, \n205 U.S. 395\n, 51 L. ed. 853, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 499, the assessment was also under the act passed on in the Stempel Case. I will not pause to detail the facts. It is enough to say that the credits taxed were loans (evidenced by notes) by the insurance company to its policy holders in Louisiana. The tax was not eo nomine on the notes, but was expressed to be on 'credits, money loaned, bills receivable,' etc., and its amount was ascertained by computing the sum of the face value of all the notes held by the company at the time of the assessment.\n The purpose of the taxing law was said to be to lay the burden of taxation equally upon those who do business within the state. And, after comment, it was said: 'Thus it is clear that the measure of taxation \n\n[233 U.S. 434, 444]\n\u00a0\n designed by the law is the fair average of the capital employed in the business.' In other words, the investments in the state were taxed, and the legality of the tax was determined by their situs, not by the locality of the notes which represented them, the notes being in New York, at the home of the insurance company.\n It was the situs of the debt which determined the legality of the taxation in all of the cases, and united them under the principle expressed in Metropolitan L. Ins. Co. v. New Orleans, that the law regards the place of the origin of negotiable paper as its true home, to which it will return to be paid, and its temporary absence can be left out of account. They do not support the broad proposition that to negotiable paper can be ascribed such tangibility and entity as so to make it a taxable object of itself in a jurisdiction other than that of the obligation it represents. This broad generality is necessary to sustain the tax in the present case if it can be regarded a direct tax on property, for Illiniois, not New York, is the situs of the debts of which the notes taxed are the evidence, and of the mortgages which secure them.\n That broad proposition was asserted in Buck v. Beach and rejected. The notes involved had their origin in Ohio and represented investments in that state. Their owner died, and one of the two trustees of his will resided in Indiana. The notes were kept in the custody of the latter except that at the time of assessment of taxes in that state they were sent to Ohio, and after the lapse of a few days returned to him. They were taxed in Indiana. The tax was sustained by the state supreme court, but declared invalid by this court.\n The proposition presented for decision was stated thus by Mr. Justice Peckham for the court: 'The sole question, then, for this court, is whether the mere presence of the notes in Indiana [the taxing state] constituted the debts of which the notes were the written evidence, property \n\n[233 U.S. 434, 445]\n\u00a0\n within the jurisdiction of that state, so that such debts could be therein taxed.' The prior cases were considered, and it was said: 'There are no cases in this court where an assessment such as the one before us has been involved. We have not had a case where could be therein taxed.' The prior cases was a resident of or present in the state where the tax was imposed, and where no business was done therein by the owner of the notes or his agent relating in any way to the capital evidenced by the notes assessed for taxation. We cannot assent to the doctrine that the mere presence of evidences of debt, such as these notes, under the circumstances already stated, amounts to the presence of property within the state.' And it was pointed out that the prior cases, which were specifically reviewed, gave no support to the rejected doctrine. It was not overlooked that certain specialty debts, state and municipal bonds and circulating notes of banking institutions, have sometimes been treated as property where they were found, though removed from the domicil of the owner, and State Tax on Foreignheld Bonds, 15 Wall. 300, 324, 21 L. ed. 188, was cited. Promissory notes were held not to be within the rule.\n It is, however, asserted that the circumstances of the case showed that the notes were fugitives from taxation, alternately from Indiana and Ohio, and that their stay in Indiana was in evasion of their obligations to Ohio, and was 'a transit, although prolonged.' But the bad motive of the possessor of the notes was not made a ground of decision. If the court felt a retributive impulse to deny the notes sanctuary in Indiana, it was suppressed. The court declared that the motive for sending the notes to Indiana was of no consequence, and that the attempt to escape proper taxation in Ohio did not confer jurisdiction on Indiana to tax them (page 402).\n But we are not required to overrule Buck v. Beach, nor make it yield in any particular in order to sustain the \n\n[233 U.S. 434, 446]\n\u00a0\n tax in the case at bar. It, in effect, reserved from its principle inheritance or succession taxing acts by rejecting as not in point cases which involved them. We said: 'The foundation upon which such acts rest is different from that which exists where the assessment is levied upon property. The succession or inheritance tax is not a tax upon property, as has been frequently held by this court (Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 44 L. ed. 969, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747; Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 U.S. 189\n, 47 L. ed. 439, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 277), and therefore the decisions arising under such inheritance tax cases are not in point.'\n The tax under review is of that kind. In other words, it is not a tax on property, but a tax upon the transfer of the property by the will of the testator of plaintiffs in error, as provided by the laws of the state. The will was probated in Connecticut, where the deceased was a resident, but ancillary letters of administration were issued to plaintiffs in error by the surrogates' court, county of New York, state of New York, and the taxed notes were part of the property disposed of by his will. It appears, therefore, that the property is in the control of the courts of New York. In other words, the laws of New York are invoked, accomplish its transfer, and subject it to the dispositions of the will, and make effectual the purposes of the testator. Blackstone v.

ISLAND TRANSP. CO.(1914)\nNo. 206\nArgued: Decided: April 13, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. M. J. Gordon, P. C. Sullivan, and E. B. Stevens for appellant. \n\n[233 U.S. 346, 347]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alpheus Byers and Ovid A. Byers for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the opinion of the court:\n While a passenger on the steamboat Fairhaven, plying upon Puget sound, Laura G. White sustained a severe personal injury in being caught or thrown by a rod, called a hog-chain, extending through the deck and connecting with the paddle-wheel. To recover for the injury she brought an action against the Island Transportation \n\n[233 U.S. 346, 348]\n\u00a0\n Company, the owner of the vessel, in the superior court for King county, in the state of Washington, naming $21,350.87 as her damages. The owner then filed a libel or petition in the district court of the United States for that district to secure the benefit of the statute limiting the liability of vessel owners. Rev. Stat.  4283-4285, U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2943, 2944; admiralty rules, 53-57, \n210 U.S. 562\n, Digest Sup. Ct. 1908, vol. 6, p. 33 Appx., 29 Sup. Ct. Rep. XLV. The petition referred to the action in the state court, and alleged that the damage claimant was insisting that her injury was caused by 'the carelessness and negligence of the employees' of the owner in handling the vessel, in not furnishing the passengers with safe and proper facilities, and in not informing them of dangerous conditions. It also alleged that the claimant was injured through her own negligence, without any fault in the construction, equipment, management, control, or care of the vessel, and especially without the privity or knowledge of the owner; that there was a valid and meritorious defense to the claim; and that the value of the vessel did not exceed $10,000. The petition, while insisting upon the right or the owner, under admiralty rule 56, to contest its liability and that of the vessel in that proceeding, prayed for an appraisement of the vessel and her pending freight, for an order for the payment of the amount of the appraisement into court, or the giving of a stipulation with sureties for such payment whenever required, for the issuance of a monition in the usual form and upon the usual condition, for an order restraining the prosecution of the action in the state court, for a decree limiting the owner's liability, if any, and for other appropriate relief. Although laying no special basis for it, the petition also, in a general way, indicated that the owner apprehended other claims and actions of a like character, and the prayer for the monition and relief was so framed as to include them. After other steps in the proceeding, which need not be noticed, the claimant answered, alleging, in substance, that her \n\n[233 U.S. 346, 349]\n\u00a0\n claim was founded solely upon the owner's negligence in that the hog-chain was part of the construction of the vessel, and, with the knowledge and acquiescence of the owner, was negligently left unboxed, uncovered, and unguarded, so that it endangered the passengers when upon the deck, in the place regularly assigned to them, and that her injury was caused by such negligence, and not by any fault of her own. In addition, the answer contained this paragraph: '8th. The respondent further alleges that the facts are such that the petitioner is not entitled to take the benefit of the limited liability acts, and joins issue with the petitioner thereon, and asks that the court determine this question before it proceeds further in the said matter.' The claimant also moved to dismiss the proceeding for want of jurisdiction, upon the ground that the pleadings showed that the injury was attributable to negligence of the owner, and that the petition disclosed but one claim and laid no basis for apprehending the existence of others. The motion to dismiss was overruled, and an exception reserved. The claimant elected to stand upon the motion, and refused to move further in the proceeding, whereupon proof of the allegations of the petition 'being waived,' a final decree was entered for the owner, adjudging that the claimant take nothing by the proceeding. This appeal followed, and a certificate was granted showing the grounds of the motion, the court's ruling, and the exception. See Judicial Code,  238 [36 Stat. at. L. 1157, chap. 231, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 228].\n The objection that the court was without jurisdiction, because the pleadings showed that the damage was occasioned by the negligence of the owner, evidently resulted from a misapprehension of what was in the pleadings. So far were they from settling where the fault lay that they put the matter directly in issue, the petition alleging that the injury was occasioned without the owner's privity or knowledge, and the answer affirming that it was caused by the owner's negligence, and not otherwise. If the fact was \n\n[233 U.S. 346, 350]\n\u00a0\n as alleged in the petition, the case was within the statute, for  4283 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2943) declares: 'The liability of the owner of any vessel . . . for any act, matter, or thing, loss, damage, or forfeiture, done, occasioned, or incurred, without the privity or knowledge of such owner or owners, shall in no case exceed the amount or value of the interest of such owner in such vessel and her freight then pending.' And while the claimant was at liberty, under admiralty rule 56, to contest the owner's right to a limitation of liability, the decision of the question necessarily rested with the court. Its jurisdiction was not ousted merely because the claimant took issue with what was alleged in the petition. Butler v. Boston & S. S. S. Co. \n130 \nU.S. 527, 552\n, 553 S., 32 L. ed. 1017, 1022, 1023, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 612. The questions of fact so presented were to be settled by a trial, and this was so whether the facts were jurisdictional or otherwise. But there was no trial. Instead of insisting that the allegations of the petition be proved, the claimant expressly waived proof of them, thereby consenting that they be taken as true. As they were plainly to the effect that the injury was without the privity or knowledge of the owner, there was no defect in the jurisdiction at that point.\n The objection that the court could not entertain the proceeding because the petition disclosed only one claim arising out of the injury is grounded upon the terms of  4284 and 4285 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2943, 2944), which require a pro rata distribution of the value of the vessel and freight when not sufficient to satisfy all claims, authorize proceedings to obtain the benefit of the statute, make the surrender of the vessel and freight for the benefit of claimants a sufficient compliance with the statute on the part of the owner, and declare that upon such surrender all claims and proceedings against the owner shall cease. It must be conceded that these sections, if taken alone, give color to the objection, for, with a single exception, their words apparently contemplate a plurality of claims. But to a right understand- \n\n[233 U.S. 346, 351]\n\u00a0\n ing of these sections it is essential that they be read with  4283 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, p. 2943). It contains the fundamental provision on which the others turn. It broadly declares that 'the liability . . . for any . . . damage . . . occasioned without the privity or knowledge of such owner . . . shall in no case exceed' the value of the vessel and freight. The succeeding sections are in the natue of an appendix, and relate to the proceedings by which the first is to be made effective. Therefore, they should be so construed as to bring them into correspondence with it. It was so held in Butler v. Boston & S. S. S. Co. \n130 \nU.S. 550, 551\n, 32 S. L. ed. 1022, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 612, where it became necessary to consider another difference in terms between them and it. In that case this court said, quoting from a decision of the supreme court of Rhode Island: 'These sections [4284 and 4285], if we look only to the letter, apply only to injuries and losses of property. The question is, therefore, whether we shall by construction bring the three sections into correspondence by confining the scope of  4283 to injuries and losses of property, or by enlarging the scope of the two other sections so as to include injuries to the person. We think it is more reasonable to suppose that the designation of losses and in juries in  4284 and 4285 (U. S. Comp. Stat. 1901, pp. 2943, 2944) is imperfect, a part being mentioned representatively for the whole, and consequently that those sections were intended to extend to injuries to the person as well as to injuries to property, than it is to suppose that  4283 was intended to extend only to the latter class of injuries, and was inadvertently couched in words of broader meaning.' In the lower Federal courts there has been some contrariety of opinion upon the point now being considered, but the prevailing view has been that due regard for the broad terms and dominant force of  4283 requires that  4284 and 4285 be construed as authorizing a proceeding for limitation of liability whether there be a plurality of claims or only one. Quinlan v. Pew, 5 C. C. A. 438, 5 U. S. App. 382, 56 Fed. 111, 120; The S. A.

Harmon, \n222 U.S. 96\n, 56 L. ed. 110, 32 Sup. Ct. Rep. 27, where there was but a single claim, it was assumed by both court and counsel that a plurality of claims was not essential. We think that is the true view of the statute.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","281":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILLIAMSON v. OSENTON(1914)\nNo. 634\nArgued: Decided: March 9, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. W. E. Chilton, S. W. Walker, and A. O. Bacon for Margaret H. Williamson.\n\n\n[232 U.S. 619, 623]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. R. G. Linn, C. Beverley Broun, and Connor Hall for Katherine osenton.\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n This case comes here upon the certified question whether the plaintiff, when she began this suit, was a citizen of Virginia in such sense as to be entitled to maintain her action in the district court of the United States for the southern district of West Virginia. The plaintiff (the defendant in error) at that time was the wife of a citizen of West Virginia, but, in consequence of his adultery, as she alleged, had separated from him and had gone to Virginia. Before bringing this action she had brought a suit in West Virginia for divorce, and pending the present proceeding obtained a divorce a vinculo. This action is for damages, alleging the defendant to have been a party to the adultery. The defendant pleaded to the jurisdiction, setting up the plaintiff's marriage and the residence of her husband in West Virginia; in other words, that the requisite diversity of citizenship did not exist. The plea seems to have been heard upon a written statement of facts in which it was agreed that the plaintiff went to Virginia 'with the intention of making her home in that state for an indefinite time in order that she might institute this suit against the defendant in the United States court,' together with the facts already stated. The plea was overruled, there was a trial on the merits, at which the \n\n[232 U.S. 619, 624]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff got a verdict for $35,000, and thereupon the case was taken to the circuit court of appeals, from which the certified question comes.\n On these facts the question certified is divided into two by the argument: first, whether, if able so to do, the plaintiff had changed her domicil from West Virginia to Virginia in fact; and, second, supposing that she had changed it so far as to have enabled her to proceed against her husband in Virginia had she been so minded, whether for other purposes her domicil did not remain that of her husband until the divorce was obtained, which was after the beginning of the present suit. Premising that if the plaintiff was domiciled in Virginia when this suit was begun, she was a citizen of that state within the meaning of the Constitution, art. 3,  2, and the Judicial Code of March 3, 1911, chap. 231, 36 Stat. at L. 1087, U. S. Comp. Stat. Supp. 1911, p. 128 (Gassies v. Ballon, 6 Pet. 761, 8 L. ed. 573; Boyd v. Nebraska, \n143 \nU.S. 135, 161\n, 36 S. L. ed. 103, 109, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 375; Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 22 L. ed. 627), we will take these questions up in turn.\n The essential fact that raises a change of abode to a change of domicil is the absence of any intention to live elsewhere (Story, Conflict of Laws,  43); or, as Mr. Dicey puts it in his admirable book, 'the absence of any present intention of not residing permanently or indefinitely in' the new abode. Confl. L. 2d ed. 111. We may admit that if this case had been before a jury on testimony merely that the plaintiff intended to live in Virginia for an indefinite time, it might have been argued that the motive assigned for the change, the bringing of this action, showed that the plaintiff, even if telling the literal truth, only meant that she could not tell when the lawsuit would end. It is to be noticed also that the divorce proceedings were carried through in West Virginia, though it is fair to assume that they were begun before the plaintiff moved. But the case was submitted to the court upon a written statement, upon which we presume both sides expected the court to rule. To give the supposed ambiguous \n\n[232 U.S. 619, 625]\n\u00a0\n meaning to the words 'for an indefinite time' in that statement would be to assume that the parties were trying to get the better of each other by a quibble. We must take them to mean: for a time to which the plaintiff did not then contemplate an end. If that is their meaning, the motive for the change was immaterial; for, subject to the second question to be discussed, the plaintiff had a right to select her domicil for any reason that seemed good to her. With possible irrelevant exceptions the motive has a bearing only when there is an issue open on the intent. Cheever v. Wilson, 9 Wall. 108, 123, 19 L. ed. 604, 608; Dickerman v. Northern Trust Co. \n176 \nU.S. 181, 191\n, 192 S., 44 L. ed. 423, 430, 431, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 311. With that established as agreed, there is no doubt that it was sufficient to work the change. Mitchell v. United States, 21 Wall. 350, 352, 22 L. ed. 584, 587; Dicey, Confl. L. 2d ed. 108, 113, 114.\n The second subdivision of the question may be answered with even less doubt than the first. The very meaning of domicil is the technically pre- eminent headquarters that every person is compelled to have in order that certain rights and duties that have been attached to it by the law may be determined. Bergner & E. Brewing Co. v. Dreyfus, 172 Mass. 154, 157, 70 Am. St. Rep. 251, 51 N. E. 531. In its nature it is one; and if in any case two are recognized for different purposes, it is a doubtful anomaly. Dicey, Confl. L. 2d ed. 98. The only reason that could be offered for not recognizing the fact of the plaintiff's actual change, if justified, is the now vanishing fiction of identity of person. But if that fiction does not prevail over the fact in the relation for which the fiction was created there is no reason in the world why it should be given effect in any other. However it may be in England, that in this country a wife in the plaintiff's circumstances may get a different domicil from that of her husband for purposes of divorce is not disputed and is not open to dispute. Haddock v. Haddock, \n201 \nU.S. 562, 571\n, 572 S., 50 L. ed. 867, 870, 871, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 525, 5 Ann. Cas. 1. This she may do without necessity and simply from choice, as the cases \n\n[232 U.S. 619, 626]\n\u00a0\n show, and the change that is good as against her husband ought to be good as against all. In the later decisions the right to change and the effect of the change are laid down in absolute terms. Gordon v. Yost, 140 Fed. 79; Watertown v. Greaves, 56 L.R.A. 865, 50 C. C. A. 172, 112 Fed. 183; Shute v. Sargent, 67 N. H. 305, 36 Atl. 282; Buchholz v. Buchholz, 63 Wash. 213, 115 Pac. 88, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 395. See Haddock v. Haddock, supra; Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582, 588, 597, 598, 16 L. ed. 226, 228, 231, 232. We see no reason why the wife who justifiably has left her husband should not have the same choice of domicil for an action for damages that she has against her husband for a divorce. We answer the question, Yes. \n\n\n\n","282":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILLOUGHBY v. CITY OF CHICAGO(1914)\nNo. 66\nArgued: Decided: November 16, 1914\n\n\n\n Messrs. William H. Sexton, Philip J. McKenna, and Howard F. Bishop for defendant in error.\n\n\n[235 U.S. 45, 47]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles R. Holden for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[235 U.S. 45, 48]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the court:\n In 1893 a portion of certain land now belonging to the plaintiffs in error was taken by Chicago for the widening of a street, and the damages to the owners were fixed by judgment in due form. Afterwards an assessment for betterments by reason of the change was laid upon certain lands in this neighborhood, including the lots in question, and was confirmed as to the other land. At the trial with regard to these lots it was contended by the owner and ruled in the lower court that the matter was concluded \n\n[235 U.S. 45, 49]\n\u00a0\n by the first judgment. This ruling was reversed by the supreme court of the state (Chicago v. Mecartney, 216 Ill. 377, 75 N. E. 117), but by the failure of the city to file the remanding order within two years the assessment upon these lots failed. In January, 1910, the city passed an ordinance for a new assessment, the object of which was to reach these lots, and a new petition was filed. The supreme court of the state held that the validity of the assessment did not depend on the validity of the ordinance; that the petition was warranted by the former proceedings, and that a judgment for the amount should be affirmed. 249 Ill. 249, 94 N. E. 513.\n The error assigned is that the property of the plaintiffs in error is taken without due process of law, and that the obligation of their contracts is impaired (they having purchased before this supplementary proceeding was begun), contrary to the 14th Amendment and art. I,  10, of the Constitution of the United States. There is a motion to dismiss upon which we must dispose of the case. The objection which is urged is that there was no statutory authority for this proceeding, and that the assessment was imposed by mere judicial fiat that could not have been anticipated, and that was without warrant of law. If there were anything in this objection, it was obvious from the beginning; and as it was not taken at the trial, it was not open in the supreme court of the state and could not be considered here. Hulbert v. Chicago, \n202 U.S. 275\n, 50 L. ed. 1026, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 617. It is obvious, too, that the state could have authorized the proceeding followed here, which ordinarily is the only question to be considered by this court. Missouri v. Dockery, \n191 U.S. 165\n, 48 L. ed. 133, 63 L.R.A. 571, 24 Sup. Ct. Rep. 53.\n If the assessment could have been levied against the original owners of the land, purchasers took subject to the same liability. Seattle v. Kelleher, \n195 U.S. 351\n, 49 L. ed. 232, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 44. The question whether it could have been levied if the land had not been sold depended upon the construction of state \n\n[235 U.S. 45, 50]\n\u00a0\n statutes, as to which we follow the decision of the state court. Even if the court had overruled earlier decisions, it would have interfered with no vested rights of the plaintiffs in error. Knox v. Exchange Bank, 12 Wall. 379, 383, 20 L. ed. 414, 415; Sauer v. New York, \n206 U.S. 536\n, 51 L. ed. 1176, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 686; Moore-Mansfield Constr. Co. v. Electrical Installation Co. \n234 \nU.S. 619, 626\n, 58 S. L. ed. 1503, 1506, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 941. But it does not appear to have done so, and although its decision may have been unexpected, there was plausible ground for it in the statutes. We go no further, because there is no question before us of the kind that was before the court in Muhlker v. New York & H. R. Co. \n197 U.S. 544\n, 49 L. ed. 872, 25 Sup. Ct. Rep. 522, and Tampa Waterworks Co. v. Tampa, \n199 \nU.S. 241, 243\n, 50 S. L. ed. 170, 173, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 23, and in circumstances like these it is not within our province to inquire whether the construction was right. It is objected that less was allowed for the land taken than was charged for the benefit, but it is quite possible that the benefit was greater than the loss, and we cannot inquire into the fact.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","283":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILSON v.

L. ed. 278, 284, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 163.\n There were numerous counts in the indictment and a general verdict of guilty. The substance of the charge was that defendants caused and procured two gils to be transported in interstate commerce from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose of prostitution. There was also a count charging a conspiracy to commit the same offense. The theory of the government, sufficiently stated in the indictment and supported by evidence at the trial, was that, in pursuance of an understanding between defendants and a man named Corder, they gave him $11 in money, with instructions to proceed from Chicago to Milwaukee, induce one or both of the girls to return with him to Chicago, paying their transportation and other expenses out of the $11, and bring them to a house of prostitution in the latter city, kept by the defendants; and that Corder carried out these instructions to the letter, bringing both girls over an interstate electric railway line and escorting them to the defendants' house for the purpose of prostitution.\n Of the questions of law that are raised, only the following seem to require mention:\n\n 1. \nIt is insisted that the offense was not fully proved because there was nothing to show that defendants either directed or knew how the girls were to come from Milwaukee to Chicago, whether in a private vehicle or through the instrumentality of a common carrier. But, in our opinion, in order to constitute an offense under the act it is not essential that the transportation be by common carrier. The statute reads: 'That any person who shall knowingly transport or cause to be transported, or aid or assist in obtaining transportation for, or in transporting, in interstate or foreign commerce, . . . any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or \n\n[232 U.S. 563, 567]\n\u00a0\n for any other immoral purpose, . . . or who shall knowingly procure or obtain, or cause to be procured or obtained, or aid or assist in procuring or obtaining, any ticket or tickets, or any form of transportation or evidence of the right thereto, to be used by any woman or girl in interstate or foreign commerce, . . . in going to any place for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose , . . . whereby any such woman or girl shall be transported in interstate or foreign commerce, . . . shall be deemed guilty of a felony,' etc.\n The prohibition is not in terms confined to transportation by common carrier, nor need such a limitation be implied in order to sustain the constitutionality of the enactment. As has already been decided, it has the quality of a police regulation, although enacted in the exercise of the power to regulate interstate commerce (Hoke v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 308, 323\n, 57 S. L. ed. 523, 527, 43 L.R.A.(N.S.) 906, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 281, Ann. Cas. 1913 E, 905; Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n114 \nU.S. 196, 215\n, 29 S. L. ed. 158, 166, 1 Inters. Com. Rep. 382, 5 Sup. Ct. Rep. 826); and since this power is complete in itself, it was discretionary with Congress whether the prohibition should be extended to transportation by others than common carriers.\n The contention that defendants were not within the prohibition of the act because they did not control or instruct Corder in the choice of means of conveyance is not worthy of serious consideration. According to the government's evidence, Corder was employed by defendants as their agent, and furnished by them with money sufficient for the expenses of the transportation, but without definite instructions as to what mode should be employed. A natural inference was that he should decide upon the mode and select the route; and that such selection was within the scope of his agency.\n\n 2. \nThe female defendant offered herself as a witness, and in the course of her cross-examination was asked whether she was addicted to the use of morphine. Having \n\n[232 U.S. 563, 568]\n\u00a0\n admitted this, and stated that she had last used it before coming into the court room that morning at 10 o'clock, she was asked how often she used it, and whether she had with her the 'implements' with which to 'take the dose.' She replied in the affirmative. This line of examination was excepted to, and is assigned for error on the ground that she had not put her character at issue. But as we read the record, the evidence was not offered or admitted for its bearing upon her character, but rather to show that she was so much addicted to the use of the drug that the question whether, at the moment of testifying, she was under its influence, or had recovered from the effects of its last administration, had a material bearing upon her reliability as a witness. It seems to us that in this aspect the evidence was admissible. People v. Webster, 139 N. Y. 73, 87, 34 N. E. 730; State v. White, 10 Wash. 611, 613, 39 Pac. 160, 41 Pac. 442.\n\n 3. \nError is assigned upon certain rulings of the trial court permitting cross-examination of the same witness, tending to show that she and the other defendant lived unhappily as husband and wife, were occasionally separated, and (as is said) that they at times indulged in the use of pistols. No evidence was in fact offered or admitted tending to show that weapons had been used, if we except an obscure allusion to 'pistols' in a letter that had been written by a person in New York city to the female defendant in Chicago. The use made of this letter was permissible for other reasons. The evidence as to the quarrels and separation was plainly admissible. The government's case depended mainly upon the testimony of Corder. He appeared to have been an accomplice, hence circumstantial corroboration of his story was especially material. He had testified that Mrs. Wilson asked him to go to Milwaukee for the purpose of getting the two girls, and had mentioned as a circumstance that this conversation took place at the Union Depot in Chicago, where he had met Mrs. Wilson at her request \n\n[232 U.S. 563, 569]\n\u00a0\n to aid her in a search for her husband. On her direct examination, she flatly denied this, saying: 'I did not take him and he never accompanied me on any trip to hunt for Mr. Wilson; I always knew where Mr. Wilson was.' The cross-examination under consideration was entirely relevant to this part of the testimony in chief.\n\n 4. \nIt is assigned for error that the court permitted the government to cross-examine the defendant, Charles Wilson, respecting entries made by him and his wife in their books of account, showing payments of money to certain police officers, and indicating friendly relations, if not co- operation, between defendants, as keepers of a house of prostitution, and members of the police force. This was not objected to as exceeding the limits of proper cross-examination, but only as being 'incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial.' We think it was admissible as tending to show the character of the house, and as tending to rebut evidence previously introduced by the defense to the effect that Mrs. Wilson had refused to harbor the girls for fear of police interference.\n\n 5. \nError is assigned upon the instructions of the trial court to the jury respecting the presumption of innocence, and the definition of reasonable doubt. Counsel for defendants preferred no request upon either subject previous to the delivery of the charge. The court instructed the jury in substance that the arrest of defendants, their indictment by the grand jury, and their arraignment, were no evidence whatever of their guilt; that the presumption of innocence meant that at the beginning of the trial they were as innocent of the charges as any man in the jury box; that this presumption continued to abide with the defendants as a complete protection, unless and until it gave way because inconsistent with the existence of a situation proved by the evidence in the case beyond all reasonable doubt; that by that [reasonable doubt] was meant, not the frame of mind of a man endeavoring to \n\n[232 U.S. 563, 570]\n\u00a0\n find a way out for somebody accused of crime, not a mere capricious doubt, not a frame of mind suggested by something occurring in the trial of the case or in the argument of counsel not based on evidence in the case; but that 'reasonable doubt is that frame of mind which forbids you to say, all the evidence considered and weighed, 'I have an abiding conviction of the defendants' guilt;' or, as it has been expressed, 'I am convinced of the defendants' guilt to a moral certainty.' If you can say that you have such a conviction, then you have no reasonable doubt, and your verdict should be 'guilty.' On the contrary, if that is your frame of mind, if you are in the frame of mind where, if it was a matter of importance to you in your own affairs, away from here, you would pause and hesitate before acting, then you have a reasonable doubt.' At the conclusion of the charge counsel for defendants said; 'I should like that the court say a little more on the reasonable doubt, as I believe it was limited only to a moral certainty. That is the only sentence I heard about that.' The argument here is that the instruction as given is faulty, because the court did not tell the jury that the government must prove its case against defendants beyond a reasonable doubt. As we read the charge, it meant nothing less than that, and was sufficiently favorable to defendants. Miles v. United States, \n103 \nU.S. 304, 309\n, 312 S., 26 L. ed. 481, 483, 484; Hopt v.

It is argued that the end and object of the act is to prevent immorality and trafficking in girls, and not the mere act of transportation. But we think that by the plain language of the statute, the offense is complete when 'any such woman or girl shall be transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any territory or the District of Columbia' as a result of any of the criminal acts previously described. The suggestion that the law contemplates a locus penitentice for defendant, after the journey is ended and the woman or girl has been brought to the intended destination within the walls of a house of prostitution, is obviously untenable.\n We find no error in the record.

Offield for the Woodward Company.\n Mr. Walter E. Ward for Hurd et al.\n\n Mr. Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court:\n The recitals of the certificate with respect to the Grant patent, and the decrees which have been rendered in suits brought for its infringement, are identical with those contained in the certificate in Seim v. Hurd, decided this day [\n232 U.S. 420\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 406]. The questions certified are, in substance, the same. The facts of the present case are thus stated in the certificate:\n'After the decision of the Supreme Court sustaining the Grant patent, Hurd commenced this suit, joining with him the legal owner and licensee of the patent, against defendants, residing and doing business within Hurd's exclusive territory. Defendant purchased the infringing tires-the rubber portions only, not the metal channel or retaining wires-from the Diamond Rubber Company of \n\n[232 U.S. 428, 429]\n\u00a0\n New York, which was the defendant in the former litigation, and the rubber, metal channels, and retaining wires were sold by the defendant, the Woodward Company, to be assembled and attached to the wheel rim of its purchasers, and not by the Kokomo Company.\n\n'Defendants now claim that the infringing tires-the rubber stock only- used by them in their business was made by the Kokomo Rubber Company, which was the defendant in the action in the district of Indiana, where the complaint was dismissed for want of equity, and sold to them by the Diamond Rubber Company of New York, at the city of New York, and there delivered.'\n\n It thus appears that the Kokomo Company did not make the patented device, but only one of its elements,-the rubber stock. Nor did the defendant itself make the patented articlc. The defendant, buying from the Diamond Company the rubber that had been made by the Kokomo Company, and otherwise obtaining the necessary channel of metal and the retaining wires, sold all the parts to be united into the patented structure by its customers. Neither the right of the Kokomo Company, by virtue of the decree in its favor, to make and sell the patented thing, or to make and sell its rubber, nor its right to have the commodity which it lawfully produces freely move as an article of commerce through the channels of trade without hindrance by the owners of the patent, is here involved. See Rubber Tire Wheel Co. v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. decided this day [\n232 U.S. 413\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 403]. The case as stated concerns the liability of the defendant as a contributory infringer upon the assumption that, in the manner described, it assembles the various elements essential to the making of the Grant tire, and sells them with the intent and purpose that they shall be so combined.\n Can the defendant demand immunity upon the ground that one of the elements in which it dealt was made and sold by the Kokomo Company? We think not. It is not \n\n[232 U.S. 428, 430]\n\u00a0\n simply a purchaser of, or dealer in, that which the Kokomo Company produces. The defendant goes beyond that; it buys from others the parts that are as much needed in effecting the patented combination as the rubber itself, and sells them in order that the infringing device may be constructed by its customers.\n The fourth question which is certified by the court below is:\n'If the Kokomo Company is immune in making the infringing rubber, which is only one element of the combination of the patent, are its customers who purchase the rubber of the Kokomo Company and the retal rims and retaining wires of other parties, and sell them to be assembled upon wheel rims, making the completed structure of the patent, also immune from prosecution?'\n\n We answer this question in the negative. The other questions are not raised by the case made, and hence are left unanswered.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","285":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWORK v. UNITED GLOBE MINES(1914)\nNo. 46\nArgued: November 6, 1913Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n Mr. A. L. Pincoffs for appellant.\n\n\n[231 U.S. 595, 597]\n\u00a0\n Mrs. Sarah H. Sorin for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n We confine our statement to so much of the case as is necessary to develop the matters for decision.\n Work, the appellant, who was plaintiff in the trial court, sued the United Globe Mines, the appellee, to quiet his title to certain described mining property, averring that he had the fee-simple title to the same, and although defendant asserted some adverse right, it had no title or interest in the property. The defendant, averring itself to be a New York corporation having its principle place of business in Globe, Gila county, Arizona, in its answer, besides traversing the averments of the complaint, alleged that it was entitled to the possession of the property sued for, and was the owner, because for more than five years before the commencement of the suit it had been\n'in the actual, continuous, uninterrupted, peaceable, exclusive, open, notorious, hostile, and adverse possession of said premises, and has been cultivating, using, enjoying, and working the same, paying taxes thereon, and holding and claiming the same and the title thereto adversely to plaintiff and all the world, under a deed from William E. Dodge and D. Willis James, conveying said premises to \n\n[231 U.S. 595, 598]\n\u00a0\n this defendant, which deed is dated January 31st, A. D., 1893, and which said deed was duly recorded on the 17th day of February, A. D., 1893, in the office of the county recorder of Gila county, said territory, in book 3, Deeds of Mines, at page 299;\n\n'And defendant alleges that the cause of action, if any, stated in the complaint herein, did not accrue within five years next before the commencement of this action.'\n\n In addition, as a second ground, the ownership of the property was asserted to have been acquired by a period of ten years' limitation, the benefit of which was expressly pleaded. The prayer of the answer was not only that the claim of the plaintiff be rejected, but that there be affirmative relief adjudging the title of the property to be in the mining company.\n The case was submitted to the trial court upon an agreed statement of facts, and was decided in favor of the defendant, and a judgment of affirmance followed in the supreme court of the state to which the case was taken, that judgment being the one to which this writ of error is directed. The court, for the purpose of its consideration of the case, adopted the statement of facts acted upon by the trial court.\n Three principal questions were decided: (a) That the United Globe Mines, although a foreign corporation, was entitled to avail itself of the statute of limitations; (b) that the deed which the United Globe Mines asserted as the basis of its claim to a right of ownership resulting from the five years' limitation under  2937 of the Revised Statutes of Arizona for 1901 was adequate, and hence the United Globe Mines was the owner of the property by limitation; and (c) besides that, the facts proven as the basis of the ten year limitation under  2938 of the Revised Statutes of Arizona for 1901 were adequate to bring the United Globe Mines within the embrace of the statute, and therefore to additionally sustain its claim of owner- \n\n[231 U.S. 595, 599]\n\u00a0\n ship on such ground. For the purposes of this appeal a number of grounds of error were asserted, but we content ourselves with the mere statement that we think they are without merit because, in the argument at bar for the appellant, only the rulings of the court below concerning the three propositions to which we have referred are discussed and insisted upon as a basis for reversal. We come, then, briefly to consider those propositions.\n At the outset it is to be observed that the questions are inherently and in the strictest sense local in character, depending as they do upon the right to have the benefit in the territory of the statutes of limitation concerning real estate, and the application of such statutes to the case as made by the defendant, the United Globe Mines. But as to questions of such character the settled rule is that this court 'accepts the construction which the territorial court has placed upon a local statute;' in other words, will not disregard or reverse the same unless constrained to do so by the clearest conviction of serious error. Phoenix R. Co. v. Landis, where a full list of the applicable cases is collected, decided December 22 last [\n231 U.S. 578\n, 58 L. ed. --, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 179]. With our duty thus defined the case is readily disposed of. As to the first question, the court below expressly found that during the whole of the statutory time the United Globe Mines, although a nonresident in the sense that it was a corporation of foreign organization, had complied with the laws of Arizona, was in possession of the property, paying taxes thereon and conducting business by means of its use, and was subject there to be sued, having under the law of the territory, an agency for that purpose. It is manifest under these conditions, if there be any ground for a different conclusion, which we do not intimate, there is no possible room for holding that such serious error was committed as to constrain us to reverse. As to the second proposition,-the five years' statute,-the only contention is that the court erred in holding that \n\n[231 U.S. 595, 600]\n\u00a0\n a reference in the deed which was relied upon to the origin of title did not operate to render the deed relied on insufficient for the purposes of the statute, although it was in every other respect adequate. That is to say, the contention is that the sufficiency of the deed should have been tested not by its own adequacy, but by the insufficiency of another deed, not involved in the case, simply because such other deed by way of mere recital was referred to in the deed which was relied on, and upon which deed the application of the bar of the statute solely depended. We do not test the accuracy of the reasoning upon which the contention must rest, nor comprehensively review the authorities, since in our opinion it cannot be said, either from the point of view of reason, or from a consideration of the decided cases, that there is ground for holding that there was such manifest error committed as to justify reversal. In saying this we intimate no doubt as to the correctness of the ruling below made; our sole purpose is to abstain from deciding a purely local question in the absence of those conditions which render it necessary for us to do so,-that is, the existence of plain error of so serious a nature as to require correction at our hands.\nAFFIRMED.\n Jackson ex dem.

STATE OF KANSAS EX REL. MARSHALL(1914)\nNo. 472\nArgued: December 2, 1913Decided: January 5, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[231 U.S. 622, 623]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. W. Dana and W. F. Douthirt for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n\n[231 U.S. 622, 625]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Richard J. Higgins, A. E. Helm, and Henderson S. Martin for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice White delivered the opinion of the court:\n The supreme court of the state of Kansas, with a modification to which it is not necessary to refer, affirmed a decree of the district court of Wyandotte county, Kansas, enjoining the plaintiff in error, the Wyandotte County Gas Company, from charging domestic consumers in the cities of Kansas City, Kansas, and Rosedale, Kansas, for natural gas furnished, any sum in excess of 25 cents per thousand cubic feet. To such decree this writ of error is directed, and the Federal ground relied upon for reversal is the existence of contract rights in favor of the Gas Company, which it is insisted were impaired by the action of the court below. \n\n[231 U.S. 622, 626]\n\u00a0\n The price which the court below sustained was lower than the rate charged by the Gas Company, and was in effect a statutory rate, since a state law fixed the rate, and forbade the charging of a higher rate without the consent of the State Utilities Commission, which consent the Gas Company, under the theory that its contract relieved it from doing so, had not sought to obtain.\n The court below rested its conclusion upon the grounds, first, that the company had no contract rights fixing rates which were impaired by enforcing the lower rate fixed in the subsequent state law, and second, that if the city had agreed with the company to fix contract rates, the action of the city was void, since the city possessed no authority to make a contract limiting its power to fix reasonable rates for the future. As the question of power, which the last proposition involves, lies at the foundation of the case, we come first to consider it, indulging, for the sake of argument, in the hypothesis that the city contracted with the company for fixed rates during a stated period, which contract would be impaired if the subsequent legislation here complained of was enforced.\n At the outset it is certain that the determination of the question of power involves a consideration and construction of the law of the state from which the city derived its authority. While, indeed, that fact does not relieve us from the duty of determining for ourselves the scope and character of the asserted contract, it is yet elementary doctrine that, in the discharge of such duty, it is incumbent upon us not to lightly disregard the construction put by the court below upon the statutes of the state, but to seek to uphold such construction as far as it can be done consistently with the obligation to independently determine whether a contract exists which, in disregard of the Constitution, has been impaired by subsequent legislation.\n The alleged contract arises from the passage in 1904 by the city of ordinance 6051, and action taken thereunder. \n\n[231 U.S. 622, 627]\n\u00a0\n The question of power is to be determined by a consideration of a comprehensive state law adopted in 1903, regulating cities of the first class, of which Kansas City was one. This law was incorporated in the general statutes of Kansas for 1905, and in referring to it we quote the section numbers as found in the act of 1905, putting in brackets the section numbers of the law of 1903, as originally adopted. Under the heading of 'General Provisions' in the 4th paragraph of  734 (2) cities of the first class were empowered 'to make all contracts and do all other acts in relation to the property and concerns of the city necessary to the exercise of its corporate or administrative powers.'\n Under the heading of 'Legislative Department, Powers of the Mayor and Council,' it was provided in  784 (51):\n'Rates for Water, Light, etc.  51.-To prescribe and fix maximum rates and charges, and regulate the collection of the same, for all water, electric light, heat, power, gas, telephone service, or any other commodity or service furnished to such city or to any of the inhabitants thereof by any person or corporation now authorized by such city by virtue of a franchise ordinance, or that may hereafter be authorized by virtue of a franchise ordinance to furnish water, electric light, heat, power, gas, or telephone service, or any other commodity or service, to such city or to its inhabitants. The rates and charges so prescribed shall at all times be reasonable and just; and if any city shall fix unreasonable and unjust rates and charges, the same may, at the instance of any producer or consumer, be reviewed and determined by the district court of the county in which such city is situated.'\n\n Under the heading of 'Public Utilities,'  902 (167), authority was given for the securing of an adequate supply of water and the granting of franchises to that end, as well as of contracting for laying pipes, etc., etc. The section contained the following provision as to rates: \n\n[231 U.S. 622, 628]\n\u00a0\n 'Provided further, that . . . the mayor and council of any such city shall at all times during the existence of any such grant, contract, or privilege have the right by ordinance to fix a reasonable schedule of maximum rates to be charged for water for public and private purposes by any such person, company, or corporation. Provided, however, That said mayor and council shall at no time fix a rate which will prohibit such person, company, or corporation from earning at least 8 per cent on its capital invested over and above its operating expenses and expenses for maintenance and taxes. In establishing and fixing such rates, the value of the plant and property of any such person, company, or corporation shall be taken into consideration, but the value of such franchise, contract, and privilege given and granted by the city to such person, company, or corporation shall not be taken into consideration in ascertaining the reasonableness of the rates to be charged to the inhabitants of such city.'\n Moreover, the section, after directing that a contract should be reduced to writing, contained the following:\n'and any attempt to evade, directly or indirectly, the requirements of this act as to such consideration, or the obligations and conditions of such contract, shall render such contract and franchise absolutely null and void and inoperative.'\n\n By  904(169) the same general power was given to make contracts and grant franchises, etc., concerning heat, light, power, and street railway franchises, as was conferred, as above stated, for the purpose of obtaining a water supply; but as to the authority to fix rates by contract, the power was limited by a restriction in substance the same as that which was imposed upon the right to contract for rates for the purposes of a water supply, since by  905 (170) the right of the city in that respect was expressly reserved to\n'at all times during the existence of any such grant, \n\n[231 U.S. 622, 629]\n\u00a0\n contract, or privilege . . . to fix a reasonable schedule of maximum rates to be charged for public and private purposes, including street lighting by any such person, company, or corporation, to the inhabitants of any such city, for gas light, electric light, electric power, or heat, and the rates of fare on any street railway.'\n\n Section 906 (170a) contained regulations as to the period of the contract which might be made and other general regulations, and closed with the provision which is inserted in the margin. \n Considering these statutory provisions, the court below (88 Kan. 165, 127 Pac. 639) decided that they did not authorize the city to devest itself by contract of its duty to see that nothing but reasonable rates were enforced, however much the statute might have as to other subjects conferred upon the city an authority to contract in the complete sense. Looking comprehensively at the provisions in question, in the light of the duty resting on us to which at the outset we referred, not lightly to disregard the construction which the state court of last resort has given to the statutes of the state, we can see no ground for holding that the court erred in its conclusion. Conceding that there are forms of expression used in the statute which, taken isolatedly, might be considered as having conferred the power to fix a contract rate, such concession is not decisive, since we must consider the statute as a whole. And\n Nothing in this act shall be construed as prohibiting any city governed and controlled by the provisions of this act from granting, and the mayor and council of any such city are hereby authorized to grant, to any person, company, or corporation, a franchise to construct, maintain, and operate a natural gas plant for the purpose of furnishing to said city and its inhabitants natural gas for lights, fuel, and all other purposes, with authority to lay and maintain all necessary mains and pipes in the streets, avenues, alleys, and public grounds of said city on such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by said mayor and council and such person, company, or corporation: Provided, That such franchise shall not continue for a longer period than twenty years. \n\n[231 U.S. 622, 630]\n\u00a0\n when we do so, we think to divorce the expressions referred to from the context, would be not to interpret and apply, but to distort the statute. Especially is this conclusion necessary when the broad scope of the provisos which we have quoted is taken into view, since they in effect forbid the making of contract rates as to both water and gas by commanding that the governmental power to see to it that only reasonable rates are exacted shall be perpetually preserved and exerted. In face of such a plain manifestation of the legislative will, it would be a departure from the obvious intent and purpose of the lawmaker to hold that the statute conferred the power to do that which the text makes it apparent there was a dominant and fixed purpose of the legislature to forbid. This conclusive view also applies to the special provision concerning natural gas. We say this because, as obviously the prior sections of the statute embraced only manufactured gas, the provision as to natural gas was rendered necessary in order to give the same power to deal with that subject as was conferred concerning manufactured gas. In other words, on its face, the purpose of the provision was to bring natural gas within the statute, subject to the regulations and limitations which the statute imposed, and it could not therefore have been intended to cause dealings concerning natural gas to be for the purpose of power conferred within the statute, and at the same time to exclude the conferred authority from the safeguards and regulations which the statute exacted. The bringing of natural gas within the power, therefore, caused it to be subject to the limitations which the statute imposed, and which, as we have seen, rendered it impossible to contract away the governmental power to forbid unreasonable and secure reasonable rates.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","287":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nYAZOO & M.V.R.

C. A. 25, 207 Fed. 281); hence we need only determine whether plain error was committed in relation to the principles of general law involved. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Error in holding that the facts afforded no ground for the application of the doctrine of assumption of the risk is the sole contention pressed in argument. A freight train \n\n[235 U.S. 376, 379]\n\u00a0\n of which the deceased was engineer, proceeding southward on a lead track, approached or was traversing a railroad yard. Ahead-the distance not being specifically defined-on a yard track connecting with, and to the left of, the lead track, there stood some loaded coal cars which, while visible to the engineer from the right side of the engine, became more and more shut off from his view as the train advanced. The engineer asked the fireman, who was on the left side of the engine, and therefore in full view of the cars, whether they were clear of the lead track, and was answered that they were. There is a dispute as to whether a head brakeman was riding in the cab, and whether subsequently, if there, he called the engineer's attention to the fact that the coal cars were not clear. But there is no dispute that the engineer again asked the fireman, who answered that the cars were not clear, and jumped from the locomotive. The engineer, having shut off his power, stepped to the left side, where, from the collision which immediately resulted, he received the injuries from which he subsequently died.\n Whatever may be the difficulty of distinguishing in many cases between the application of the doctrine of assumption of risk and the principles of contributory negligence, that there is no such difficulty here is apparent, since the facts as stated absolutely preclude all inference that the engineer knew, or, from the facts shown, must be presumed to have known, that the coal cars were protruding over the track on which he was moving, and deliberately elected to assume the risk of collision and great danger which would be the inevitable result of his continuing the forward movement of his train. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[235 U.S. 376, 380]\n\u00a0\n The impossibility of deducing assumption of the risk from the facts stated is cogently demonstrated by the arguments advanced to establish the risk was assumed. Thus it is urged that, as in a railroad yard there was danger to arise from the protrusion of cars negligently placed by employees of the company, a danger which the engineer must have known might arise, therefore he assumed the risk of such danger. And again, the argument is that even although the engineer did not know of the protruding cars, and therefore did not consciously incur the great risk to result from the collision, yet, as by proper precaution he could have discovered the fact that the cars were protruding, he must be considered to have assumed the risk which resulted from his want of care. But both these arguments have no relation to the doctrine of assumption of the risk, and only call for the application of the principle of contributory negligence or of fellow servant.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chicago Junction R.

OF NEW JERSEY(1914)\nNo. 389\nArgued: February 26, 1914Decided: March 9, 1914\n\n\n\n\n[232 U.S. 602, 603]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Ulysses S. Koons and Vedantus B. Edwards for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Arthur G. Dickson and Arthur W. Rinke for defendant in error.\n\n Memorandum opinion by direction of the court. By Mr. Chief Justice White:\n As administratrix of the estate of her deceased husband, the plaintiff in error sued to recover for the loss occasioned by his death, alleged to have resulted from the negligence of the defendant railroad company. Over the objection of the defendant the case was submitted by the trial court to the jury, and from the judgment entered on the verdict rendered against the railroad company, error was by the company prosecuted from the circuit court of appeals. On the hearing that court, concluding that the evidence did not justify the submission of the case to the jury, reversed the judgment, and in passing upon a motion made by the railroad company in the trial court, pursuant to the Pennsylvania practice for judgment in its favor non obstante veredicto, it was held that the motion was well taken, and the case was remanded to the trial court, not for a new trial, but with directions to enter a judgment for the defendant. -- L. R.A.(N.S.) --, 118 C. C. A. 465, 200 Fed. 359. As the case as made by the pleadings depended not merely upon diverse citizenship, but was expressly based on the employers' liability act, error was prosecuted from this court.\n We shall not undertake to analyze the evidence, or review the grounds which led the court below to conclude that error was committed in submitting the case to the jury, because we think it is adequate to say that after a careful examination of the record we see no reason for holding that the court below erred in so deciding. As regards, however, the ruling on the motion for judgment \n\n[232 U.S. 602, 604]\n\u00a0\n non obstante veredicto, it is apparent, in view of the recent decision in Slocum v. New York L. Ins. Co. \n228 U.S. 364\n, 57 L. ed. 879, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 523, that error was committed. It follows that our duty is to affirm and modify; that is, to affirm the judgment of reversal, and to modify by reversing so much of the action of the court below as directed the entry of a judgment in favor of the defendant. Conformably to this conclusion it is ordered that the judgment of reversal be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, and that the direction for entry of judgment in favor of defendant be reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court, with directions to set aside its judgment and grant a new trial.\n Affirmed and modified. \n\n\n\n"}}
